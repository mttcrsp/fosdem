<p>If you come to FOSDEM by car, you can park your car on the campus. The <strong>main parking</strong> is located between Janson and the K building. See the map on this page for the exact location. The entrance to the parking is on Av. Franklin Roosevelt next to the H building. Note: There is <strong>no entrance</strong> from Av. Adolphe Buyl.</p>
<p>An <strong>additional parking</strong> on the campus is available next to the U building at Av. Antoine Depage. Note that this is a one-way street, only accessible from Av. Franklin Roosevelt as well.</p>
<p>You can park on the campus at your own risk. Do not leave any valuables in your car!</p>
<p>The parkings of the campus can be very busy since early morning during both days. An alternative is to leave your car in the <a href="https://www.interparking.be/en/parkings/brussels/sablon-poelaert/"> Parking Sablon-Poelaert</a>, from there to take the <a href="https://www.stib-mivb.be/horaires-dienstregeling2.html?l=en&amp;_line=8&amp;_directioncode=F&amp;_mode=rt">Tram 8</a>, direction Roodebeek. Then follow the <a href="#bus">instructions above</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that most streets directly surrounding the ULB campus are in a so-called 'blue zone'. Parking in the blue zone is free, but limited to a maximum of two hours on Monday - Saturday. Use of a parking disc displaying the arrival time is mandatory here. The picture on the right shows one of the signs that may be used to indicate this blue zone. These signs are placed on the zone edges, so not repeated on every street inside the zone. Other nearby streets are in paid parking zones: check where you park your car.</p>
<p>As of 2018, the ULB campus Solbosch is within the Brussels Low Emissions Zone (LEZ). Drivers of cars registered abroad are required to register before entering the LEZ, or risk being fined. Registering is free of charge. More information can be found <a href="https://www.lez.brussels/en">here</a>.</p>
