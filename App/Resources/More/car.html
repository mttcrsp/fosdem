Be aware that most streets directly surrounding the ULB campus are in a
so-called 'blue zone'. Parking in the blue zone is free, but limited to
a maximum of two hours on Monday - Saturday. Use of a parking disc
displaying the arrival time is mandatory here. The picture on the right
shows one of the signs that may be used to indicate this blue zone.
These signs are placed on the zone edges, so not repeated on every
street inside the zone. Other nearby streets are in paid parking zones:
check where you park your car.

As of 2018, the ULB campus Solbosch is within the Brussels Low Emissions
Zone (LEZ). Drivers of cars registered abroad are required to register
before entering the LEZ, or risk being fined. Registering is free of
charge. More information can be found <a href="https://www.lez.brussels/en">here</a>.
