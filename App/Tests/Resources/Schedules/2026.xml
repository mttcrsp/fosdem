      <biography>&lt;p&gt;Longtime linux/unix nerd and IETF email/DNS person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a linux user since august 1992, which was a hard time, we didn't have a proper bootloader yet and Linus released kernels faster than I could carry floppies home from university. Also we had to walk uphill through the snow to get to the vt220 and access the internet. A few years later I helped found one of the first opensource companies (and Stallman called for my personal bankruptcy), and I wrote my first RFC around the same time. Thirty years later I now work for ICANN, making email and the DNS work for all the people, not just those who read and write the latin alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;</biography>

Kühn began his work in the software freedom movement as a volunteer in 1992 — as an early adopter of Linux-based systems and contributor to various FOSS projects, including Perl.  He worked during the 1990s as a system administrator and software developer for various companies, and taught AP Computer Science at &lt;a href="http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2007/05/05/walnut-hills-1998.html"&gt;Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;.

As FSF’s Executive Director from 2001–2005, Kühn led FSF’s GPL enforcement, launched its Associate Member program, and invented the Affero GPL. Kühn began as SFC’s primary volunteer from 2006–2010, and became its first staff person in 2011. Kühn's work at SFC focuses on &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/"&gt;enforcement of the GPL agreements&lt;/a&gt;, FOSS licensing policy, and non-profit infrastructural solutions for FOSS.  Kühn holds a summa cum laude B.S. in Computer Science from &lt;a href="https://www.loyola.edu/academics/computer-science"&gt;Loyola University in Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and an M.S. in Computer Science from the &lt;a href="http://www.cs.uc.edu/"&gt;University of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn/articles/thesis/"&gt;Kühn's Master's thesis&lt;/a&gt; discussed methods for dynamic interoperability of Free Software programming languages. Kühn received the Open Source Award in 2012, and the Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 2021 — both in recognition for his lifelong policy work on copyleft licensing and its enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</biography>

      <biography>&lt;p&gt;Mauro has been deeply passionate about email and digital communications since the early days of the internet. His journey with email began in 1993 through UUCP, when he ran a Bulletin Board System (BBS) that provided users with access to Fidonet as well as email services fetched via UUCP. This early experience set the foundation for a career dedicated to improving and innovating email technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Mauro developed a webmail client in C that gained widespread popularity, serving as a trusted solution for many large companies. His expertise in the field continued to grow, and in the early 2000s, he expanded his offerings by creating a comprehensive mail server supporting IMAP, POP3, and SMTP protocols, which he seamlessly bundled with his webmail client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two decades, Mauro observed that despite the rapid evolution of technology, the email landscape had remained largely stagnant, with complex, outdated software dominating the space. Driven to modernize email infrastructure, he set out to develop a new mail server from scratch using Rust—a powerful, modern programming language designed for speed, security, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;</biography>

At MongoDB and Datastax he was part of a performance team that introduced the use of e-divisive change point detection to find performance regressions in a history of performance testing results. This work was open sourced and continues today as the Apache Otava (incubating) project. Henrik is also the CEO of Nyrkiö, a startup working to further productize and mainstream Otava and other tools used in continuous performance engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his free time Henrik travels to various European karting tracks, where he measures and analyzes lap times of his son's race car. Making cars go faster has a surprising amount of parallels with making software go faster.&lt;/p&gt;</biography>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We need to talk about war. And we need to talk about companies building bots that propose to rewrite our source code. And about the people behind both, and how we preserve what is great about FOSS while avoiding disruption. How do geopolitical conflicts on the one hand and the risk of bot-generated (adversarial) code on the other influence the global community working together on Free and Open Source software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immense corpus of free and open source software created by a global community of researchers and engineers, developers, architects and designers is an impressive achievement of human collaboration at an unprecedented scale. An even bigger circle of users, translators, writers, creatives, civil society advocates, public servants and private sector stakeholders has helped to further develop and spread this technological Gesammtkunstwerk far and wide - with the help of the internet and the web. With individual freedoms and user empowerment at its center, these jointly created digital public goods have removed many economic and societal barriers for a large part of the world's population. Users are not just allowed to benefit from technology, but each and every user can in principle actively help shape it. On top of the FOSS ecosystem our global economy has been propelled to unprecedented levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this incredible growth was achieved within a (relatively) calm geopolitical situation, in the wake of the cold war which ended in the very same year that also saw the genesis of the World Wide Web at CERN in Switzerland. Economists, philosophers and other observers at the time spoke of the 'end of history' and expected no more big conflicts at the superpower level. We could now globalise the economy and all work together. The flood of innovation taking place all around us promised a bright future for all, with room for altruism and collaboration. In retrospect it certainly was an ideal situation for an optimistic and constructive global movement like the FOSS community to take over the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apart from the fact that under the surface that narrative was already flawed (with some actors like the USA having a double agenda, as the Snowden and Shadowbrokers revelations exposed) history didn't end. To some ironic extent we are now becoming victim of our own success. In recent years we've seen geopolitical stability punctured by war effort levering low cost technology that includes heaps of FOSS. Social media powered by FOSS infrastructure promote disinformation and have successfully stirred large scale polarisation. Within some of the largest and most populous countries on the planet authoritarian regimes have successfully used technology to break oppression in a new race towards totalitarianism. While for instance Europe has tried to regulate 'dual use' technology, "any use" technology (which our libre licenses guarantee) has escaped our attention. Even in countries which had stable non-authoritarian regimes there is a visible technology-assisted relapse towards anti-democratic movements. On the back of a tech stack which consists of FOSS with a thin crust of proprietary special sauce, unprecedented private capital (sometimes referred to as 'hypercapitalism') is interfering with global politics at an alarming rate. Apart from the direct democratic disbalance the resulting oligarchy is giving rise to overt nepotism, corruption and a new global protectorate for predatory business models and unethical extractive behaviour. Expecting peace in cyberspace any time soon is probably naive, and free and open source technology stands to make up for a significant part of the battleground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time we are facing other challenges, such as climate change and an imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources. We have more people living on the surface of the planet than ever before, and they are consuming more raw materials and more energy than ever. This won't go on indefinitely. And right at that point we see an army of next generation Trojan horses galloping through the gates of our global commons villages, accelerating our use of both. Generative pre-trained transformers (also known as Large Language Models) kindly offer to take cumbersome and boring coding work off our hands. They can liberate us from responsibility and allow us to do other things or move even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it really wise to accept this apparent gift, or should we be a little more suspicious? Just as it has proven way too easy for AI to poison the web with fake content, our software supply chain is vulnerable to manipulation. The attack surface is immense. Due to the inherent complexity of software it is easier to achieve and harder to detect manipulation before it is too late. While many talented and committed people have spent years reverse engineering binary blobs to avoid the associated risks, those blobs were at least isolated and clearly marked. AI is the ultimate black box and it introduces significantly more uncertainty: it rewrites the truth from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI in its current form has no actual sense of truth or ethics. Like with Russian roulette, once in a while the models completely bork up and create phantom code and real risk - and that is even in a best case scenario, without assuming malicious intent and manipulation from the outside. In an adversarial scenario (and this adversity can come from traditional nation state actors with non-aligned interests but also from corporate or even private individuals with some determination - like Cambridge Analytica illustrated so vividly) manipulation only requires subtle changes. At the frantic scale at which any available learning content is ingested from the internet these days one can expect targeted adversarial training to manipulate specific code with subtle triggers to go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community we have spent billions of hours of careful coding and software engineering to make free and open source technology as trustworthy as it is today. Geopolitical conflict is an incentive to hollow out that trust. AI is an additional leap of faith, and if you look at the forces driving its adoption and their interests, are we really sure those black boxes are safe to invite into our trusted coding base? It is clear that the end game of AI coding is not a healthy FOSS ecosystem, but its total displacement. The threat of machine crafted and man-crafted malicious code in war-time FOSS are equally realistic. Perhaps we can find a middle ground, where we combine some of AI and human skill - and add enough checks and balances, and a variety of assurances through compartementalisatoin, formal and symbolical proofs and other traditional means of quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is an open exploration of some of the challenges the FOSS community will have in the years ahead, working towards a hopeful notion of maximal defendable FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the Git project has turned 20 years old, and in these 20 years it has taken over the world of version control systems by storm: nowadays, almost every developer uses Git. But that doesn't mean that Git is perfect and "done", or even close to it. It still has many warts: user experience, arbitrary limitations, performance issues and no good support for large binary files are just some of the issues that users commonly complain about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you'll learn what is happening in the Git project to address these issues. The talk will cover both recent additions to Git that make your life easier, as well as ongoing development that is expected to land in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Mercurial, 20 years and counting: how are we still alive and kicking?</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; is a Distributed Version Control System created in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has been constantly active since then, fostering &lt;a href="https://heptapod.net/"&gt;modern tooling&lt;/a&gt;, introducing &lt;a href="https://octobus.net/blog/2020-11-26-modern-mercurial"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5989-a-glimpse-into-a-smoother-version-control-experience/"&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt;, spawning multiple &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/15/open-source/sapling-source-control-scalable/"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; from its community, keeping &lt;a href="https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/log?rev=51489f639f649cb13fd7a2e28284ee7e957425df"&gt;itself&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/rev/8b7123c8947b"&gt;competitive&lt;/a&gt;, and with sustained funding for its development. However nowadays, most people we encounter remember Mercurial for losing the popularity battle to its sibling &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; in the 2010s and think the project dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk confronts this paradox. How did Mercurial get itself in such a situation? What can everyone learn from it? What does this mean for the future of version control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our first hand knowledge of Mercurial's history, we look at a selection of events, contributor profiles, technical and community aspects, to see how they've affected the project's course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will focus on topics that we have been asked about most frequently, such as:
* How has Mercurial weathered the Git storm?
* Which impacts has Mercurial had on your life, unbeknownst to you?
* How has the involvement from behemoth companies reshaped the project?
* What brings people to Mercurial in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we leverage the knowledge extracted from our past, to assess the present state of version control, try to predict its future, and highlight how community-based open-source remains as relevant as ever.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>An Efficient Git Workflow For High-Stakes Projects</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Git is a tool most programmers rely on, whether for work or personal projects. It’s far more than just a method for syncing local and remote changes. Git embodies a way of thinking that serves as the foundation for development workflows and steers project evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Git has essential concepts such as commits, change history, branching, rebasing, and merging. While Git offers many features, these are its heart. Misusing them can lead to significant opportunity costs, while striking the right balance simplifies development at all levels and benefits the project’s community (if it has any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I am sharing my own experience how applying these core concepts in real projects significantly accelerates development, especially in mission-critical systems. I’ll cover specifically the following topics with true examples from my work places, both open and closed source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of commit “atomicity” and what it means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost and value of maintaining a clean commit history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How “multi-commit patchsets” can accelerate development and code review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using rebase as a method for constructing patchsets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge-Commits vs Fast-Forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that combined into a framework that I call "Atomic Flow".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams enforce strict Git practices based on these key principles, and for good reason. I’ve worked on projects that fully harnessed Git’s potential from the outset, as well as those that initially overlooked its strengths but later embraced them. My goal is to help more teams achieve greater efficiency by adopting these best practices, provided their project highly depends on uncompromising code quality and easy maintenance. This is what "Atomic Flow" is about.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Does your project get pull requests that you dread reviewing? Have you ever submitted a pull request that got ignored by project maintainers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting together a pull request that presents proposed changes in a clear, well-organized way is nearly impossible for newer contributors to do on their own. Maintainers must take the lead in providing specific guidelines for pull requests for their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give maintainers a toolkit for teaching contributors how to produce PRs they’ll love to review. It’s derived from our experience onboarding hundreds of contributors to the Zulip open-source team chat project (https://github.com/zulip). I’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using commit structure for storytelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-review guidelines and checklists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using PR descriptions to flag points of uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectively demonstrating visual changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways for current and future project maintainers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re getting pull requests that are a pain to review, there’s a lot you can do to fix this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A toolkit of ideas to select from that will make your community PRs easier to review going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways for contributors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to present your pull requests clearly, so that maintainers are happy to review them and give you prompt feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are certain expected norms of Open Source projects. Not just that the code is open, but also that there is free and public discourse. The public discourse in particular allows for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People to see if they like the technology and project(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People to see if they like the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountability and transparency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals "are simple" in that they are easy to write. There are many goals for open source, not the least of which is the above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about if what we're seeing is in alignment with those goals.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explore the hot debated terminology and meaning around "sovereign AI". We'll look at what the major AI vendors say, what open source communities are producing and how EU stakeholders, politicians and activists are navigating the debate. At the end, we'll address significant open questions and calls for action as to how to better create and support open-source, private and secure AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The regular FOSDEM lightning talk track isn't chaotic enough, so this year we're doubling down on Lightning Lightning Talks (now with added lightning!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought of a last minute topic you want to share? Got your interesting talk rejected? Has something exciting happened in the last few weeks you want to talk about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get that talk submitted to Lightning Lightning Talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submitted talks will be automatically presented by our Lightning Lightning Talk System, which keeps track of the time limit for the current speaker and the order of presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenters who attempt to speak for longer than 256 seconds risk being swept off the stage by our Lightning Lightning Talk Cleanup Crew.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon a forum post of Jean, tasked in 2010 with recovering text documents for a friend from their broken Windows 95 computer. Their friend used Microsoft Bob, and the Microsoft Bob letter writer exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated by this story, and then spent months reverse-engineering the Microsoft Bob APIs. Ultimately producing the first third-party Microsoft Bob application. During this I learned that Microsoft Bob isn't only a laughable flop, (The word "only" is doing a lot of work here), it also had strong ideas on what computing should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will take a tour of Bob and its history and what I discovered about its technical underpinnings while reverse engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can convince you that these stories are still relevant today, and can inform us on how we think about the software we use. But most importantly; the software we recommend our (non-techy) friends and family to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing Hard-working, Easy going Software Everyone Will Use&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;raylib began as a simple and easy-to-use graphics library to teach graphics programming. Over 12 years it has become one of the most popular C open-source graphics libraries in software world, supporting more than 20 platforms and operating systems, with bindings for over 60 programming languages. Remarkably, raylib is still actively developed and maintained by a single person: its original author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore this 12-year adventure directly from its creator. We will look at how the library has evolved, how a tools ecosystem and community has been formed around it, what challenges and decisions shaped raylib direction and how the project has influenced the creator’s life. This is the story of a passionate open-source adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How much do you know about Free Software, Open Source, Developers, and European meetings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you a lively TV-style quiz show featuring  several rounds of questions deemed too geeky for TV - about kernels, software projects, and digital culture. (Some will offer mass audience participation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fun game it will separate the Red Hat's from the Red Star's, the Linus Torvalds from "some random person in Nebraska", and is a fantastic way to enjoy our community even more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux desktop is moving to a new era, ditching complex software spaghetti with years of tech debt with… a protocol? That's it? And you expect some compositor projects replace the almighty X server? Replace just the X server? When the protocol's the limit, we can do far more and far more fun stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore some more-or-less obscure uses for Wayland compositors and an embedded case study how simple task of porting DOOM to a router ended up with making it run basically all modern Linux desktop apps with it for free, with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Personal or professional - Linux on the desktop matters! It’s the daily interface between users and digital sovereignty – and it’s often put last. While Linux rules the cloud, servers, and mobile devices, the desktop is where control, compliance, and independence become tangible. This talk explores the current state of Linux on the desktop in Europe, with a focus on two real-world case studies from a leading automotive company and the German government. We’ll examine success stories, roadblocks, and new approaches like immutable Linux, zero-trust models, and EU-level OS initiatives. If we ignore the desktop, we risk leaving the front door of digital sovereignty wide open – or we can start where it matters most: every desk, every user, every day.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;h1&gt;Windows 10 is now end of life!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;... but not dead. Yet.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The prospect of that alone should be enough to motivate change to Linux desktops - but various governments are providing a lot more reasons to move, such as...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tariffs (on goods and possibly services)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unreliability (in trade and defence partnerships)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased need for data sovereignty
....to name a few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been part of migration projects most of my career, so in this talk I'll present some of the big picture items to consider when you are promoting the idea of migrations to Linux - such as politics, cost and practicality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the growing movement to cloud based applications has reduced Windows dependencies, so it is now easier than ever to migrate to a Linux based desktop solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll introduce you to someone called Horace and help you to get him to YES.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Why Office is not as easy as you might hope. Come and hear about office algorithms &amp;amp; data structures, as well as the interesting engineering challenges of interoperability from the Libre / Collabora Office experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear how many decades of accumulated backwards compatibility can make life particularly interesting. See why the temptation to start a new office suite from scratch overwhelms many people from time to time, and get some insights into the compromises that brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear about a code-base that has been loved over decades - through many tech fashions: from Java to component programming; from OS/2 to today's advertising subsidized platform of the future: the Web; from CADT methodology, to CRDT data structures; from bundled python to bundled databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear about the incredible lack of user focus that has plagued decisions and made many things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then hear our vision on driving FLOSS Office to take over the world and progress to date; see a number of pretty pixels to sooth your eyes chosen from the ergonomic beauty that is coming to make open source rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally hear how you can get involved with Collabora Online &amp;amp; LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Libreboot: Free Your BIOS Today!</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="main">Main Track</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Libreboot is a coreboot distribution — just as Debian is a Linux distribution — providing fully free (libre) boot firmware for x86 and ARM systems. It replaces proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware, initializing hardware and starting your operating system. Linux and BSD operating systems are well supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coreboot provides essential hardware initialization and then jumps to a payload program that boots your OS. Libreboot provides several payloads including, but not limited to, U-Boot, SeaBIOS and GRUB. Firmware images are provided pre-compiled, for ease of installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libreboot began in 2013 and, as of September 2025, is an official Associated Project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI), joining long-established Free Software initiatives such as Debian. This talk will be presented by Leah Rowe, Libreboot’s founder and lead developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firmware freedom is more critical than ever as we increasingly depend on computing, for participation in every aspect of civil society. Proprietary firmware endangers privacy, ownership, and repairability. Libreboot ensures that users truly control their hardware — protecting both user freedom and hardware longevity — while promoting a sustainable culture of hardware reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libreboot provides faster boot speeds, better security, and greater flexibility than typical proprietary firmware. Libreboot continues to provide updates — including security updates — long after vendors have dropped official support. The project’s philosophy is simple: you should keep using your hardware until you decide otherwise. Planned obsolescence is only a lack of imagination. Unlike the vendors, we will not try to control the users; our goal is to set you free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will trace Libreboot’s long-term development history, its current progress, and its future roadmap. This talk will also include a live demonstration showing how easy and affordable it is for non-technical users to build and install Libreboot via automation. Libreboot makes free firmware accessible, practical, and even fun, empowering even non-technical users to take back control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this talk, Libreboot 25.12 (December 2025) also includes a Tianocore UEFI payload and extensive new hardware support — including hundreds of Chromebooks, several Intel Alder Lake platforms, and numerous Kaby Lake and Skylake ThinkPads. These additions, the result of sustained work throughout 2024 and 2025, mark a major expansion of Libreboot’s scope and capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libreboot’s main code repositories are hosted at: &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/libreboot"&gt;https://codeberg.org/libreboot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libreboot’s SPI association provides fiscal sponsorship, ensuring transparent management and legal protection for the project. Libreboot also receives corporate support from Minifree Ltd, operated by Leah Rowe, which provides computers pre-installed with Libreboot firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libreboot is a community project and we welcome every new contributor. Join us on Libera IRC (&lt;code&gt;#libreboot&lt;/code&gt;) or via our SourceHut mailing list to participate.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At Wikimedia Foundation, we run Wikipedia, the world's favourite encyclopædia and one of the top ten websites of the Internet! No unicorns, just hardware, open source, and a small engineering org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk pulls back the curtain on the stack that keeps Wikipedia fast, reliable, and resilient at global scale. Caching layers, databases, microservices, and Kubernetes are all stitched together to serve the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also touch on how we've brought our 25-year-old monolith into the cloud-native era, and discuss the challenges we're navigating as the ongoing ~~rise of the machines~~ surge in LLM traffic changes the game.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In September and October 2025, RubyGems and Bundler, the clients and package registry for the Ruby language, had most of their maintainers removed by RubyCentral, the non-profit foundation that claimed ownership of these repositories. Since then, some of these repositories have been moved into the Ruby organisation and some of the ex-RubyGems maintainers have created an alternative hosting service, gem.coop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a neutral party involved with initial mediation between RubyCentral and the maintainers before and during this transition and helped gem.coop bootstrap a governance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events have much for non-Ruby projects to learn about non-profits, governance, money and access in open-source and I will share my learnings without taking any particular side in the disputes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Upgrading high load PostgreSQL databases is a challenge on its own. When having customers around the globe with tight SLAs, the requirement arises to execute these upgrades with minimal or even no downtime at all.
This talk shares GitLab's journey from multi-hour maintenance windows to truly zero-downtime upgrades for our PostgreSQL infrastructure. You'll learn the battle-tested techniques we've developed over the last 4 years, like how we execute PostgreSQL major upgrades and OS (glibc) upgrades at the same time, prevent data corruption, as well as always keeping a rollback path via reverse replication.
We'll walk through real production examples, the gotchas we discovered, and the tooling we built.
Whether you're managing a single HA cluster or a global fleet, you'll leave with actionable strategies to minimize (or eliminate) downtime during your next major upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;1000 years ago in the Package Management devroom at FOSDEM 2018 I gave a talk entitled &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/how_to_make_package_managers_cry/"&gt;"How To Make Package Managers Cry"&lt;/a&gt;, where I presented a range of techniques that open source software projects can apply to make the life of package managers utterly miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the world is a different place since then...
Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that this was just the tip of the iceberg.
Open source enthusiasts have come up with many more and even better ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and learn about the creative yet tremendously effective ways in which open source software projects (and the broader ecosystem) have taken things to the next level to make package managers scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also get to know a couple of tools that (for some reason) try to counter these best practices, to great dismay of the open source software community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you too want to make package managers scream, don't miss this talk...&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Code, Compliance, and Confusion: Open Source in Safety-Critical Products</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The integration of Open Source Software (OSS) in functionally safe systems represents a critical intersection of innovation and compliance requirements across multiple industries. This talk examines two complementary aspects of this evolving landscape: the current state of OSS in functional safety applications and the persistent barriers hindering wider adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024/2025 have marked significant acceleration in the visibility and adoption of OSS in safety-critical environments, with diverse projects demonstrating varying levels of maturity. Foundation-backed initiatives like the ELISA project within the Linux Foundation are establishing frameworks for Linux in safety applications, while specialized operating systems such as Zephyr and Xen continue to gain traction. The Eclipse Foundation's Safe Open Vehicle Core (S-Core) project represents another significant advancement, aiming to create a common certifiable automotive middleware stack that addresses critical safety requirements. The ecosystem now spans from microkernel solutions like L4Re and seL4 to full-featured platforms, with Linux serving as a prime example of the opportunities and challenges in this space. Infrastructure improvements like the SPDX safety profile address critical aspects of safety documentation in Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), while safety-certified components like the Ferrocene Rust compiler create new possibilities for language-level safety guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress, substantial barriers impede broader OSS adoption in functionally safe systems. A particularly persistent challenge remains the confusion around terminology and approaches - exemplified by the distinctions between "safety Linux" versus "safe Linux" that illustrate broader issues in how safety responsibility is allocated between OSS components and system-level mitigations. By examining architectural concepts currently implemented in production systems or under development, this talk cuts through marketing rhetoric to provide clear distinctions between approaches across various open source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author will address uncertainty around certification pathways, challenges in establishing sufficient evidence for safety arguments, fragmented governance models, and incomplete understanding of OSS development processes among safety assessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will gain practical insights for evaluating safety approaches in OSS-based systems, including key questions to ask when assessing different safety concepts across industries, with particular emphasis on applications where both manufacturers and suppliers are seeking to implement open source software in safety-critical production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to relevant example projects as part of the talk are available in the resources.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, the good name of crates.io was invoked and besmirched by a phishing attack that targeted the owners of many popular crates, much as other language ecosystems had been the target of attacks in the preceding couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go over how this all went down, what we did, and how a worldwide Rust Project &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Rust Foundation &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Alpha-Omega collaboration was crucial in its rapid mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, &lt;a href="https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/introducing-npm-package-provenance/"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-11-14-pypi-now-supports-digital-attestations/"&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby/rubygems/pull/8239"&gt;RubyGems&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://central.sonatype.org/news/20250128_sigstore_signature_validation_via_portal/"&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; have implemented attestations to provide build provenance: linking a package to its exact source code and build instructions. Some of these ecosystems also implemented publish/release attestations detailing exactly what files a specific version of a package should contain. These attestations are distributed as Sigstore bundles, so we'll start out by going over enough &lt;a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/how-it-works"&gt;Sigstore&lt;/a&gt; to understand how to verify and get the attestation information from these bundles, the APIs to get these attestations for each ecosystem, and discuss the implementation tradeoffs made by each ecosystem, as well as alternatives for non-programming language ecosystems to consider.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Package management systems tackle resolving package dependencies in different ways, which usually involves associating a package a name and version at least.
In this talk I am doing a bit of an exploration of the solution space, including how dependencies are resolved in:
- a language specific package manager with a lock file (example: cargo https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- by a typical distribution (example: Debian https://www.debian.org/ )
- by Nix(https://nixos.org/) and Guix(https://guix.gnu.org/) (example: Guix)
Then I will reflect on these solutions from the perspective of reproducible builds(https://reproducible-builds.org/).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Package managers are legion. Every language and operating system has its own solution, each with subtly different semantics for dependency resolution. This fragmentation prevents multi-lingual projects expressing precise dependencies across language ecosystems, means external system and hardware dependencies are implicit and unversioned, and obscures security vulnerabilities that lie in the full dependency graph. We present the Package Calculus, a formalism for dependency resolution that unifies the core semantics of diverse package managers. Through a series of formal reductions, we show how real-world package manager features reduce to our core calculus. We define the language Pac to translate between distinct package managers and show we can perform dependency resolution across ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While reproducible builds provide a gold standard for artifact integrity, they often treat the build process itself as a black box: either it matches or it doesn't. But in an era of sophisticated supply chain attacks like the XZ backdoor and Shai Hulud, understanding why a build behaves the way it does is just as critical as the final output. To secure the open-source package ecosystem, we needed to look inside this black box. In this talk, we explore how OSS Rebuild instruments the build environment to detect "badness" in real-time. We detail our open-source observability suite, featuring a transparent network proxy for uncovering hidden remote dependencies and an eBPF-based system analyzer for examining build behavior in fine detail.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>PURL: From FOSDEM 2018 to international standard</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At FOSDEM 2018, we introduced Package-URL (PURL: https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec), a "mostly" universal URL to identify and locate software packages: https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/purl/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, PURL is an international standard to accurately and consistently reference packages across ecosystems, regardless of whether you're working with language-specific managers, OS distributions, or containerized environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk highlights the journey of PURL, from its first presentation to Ecma standard and planned ISO standard. We'll share how PURLs enable accurate package tracking across ecosystems for vulnerability management (PURL is now part of CVE format), tool interoperability (already adopted by security tools, SCA platforms, and package registries), and compliance and security workflows (generating accurate and actionable SBOMs and VEXs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you maintain a package manager, build supply chain security tools, query packages or vulnerability databases, or just want better visibility into your polyglot dependencies, you'll learn how this lightweight standard is the essential infrastructure for modern software ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Package manifests record source-level dependencies: &lt;em&gt;pandas&lt;/em&gt; depends on &lt;em&gt;numpy&lt;/em&gt;'s code. The story is different for binary dependencies: &lt;em&gt;numpy&lt;/em&gt; depends on &lt;em&gt;OpenBLAS&lt;/em&gt;'s binaries, but package managers can't easily see this. We must map the OSS ecosystem's binary dependency relationships to reliably (1) identify upstream security vulnerabilities and (2) properly credit and financially support maintainers. I propose solving this problem by creating a global index of binary dependencies, using a &lt;em&gt;global linker&lt;/em&gt; that tracks binaries' symbols across the entire Open Source ecosystem, combined with auxiliary strategies like statically analysing build recipes.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Package registries are critical infrastructure used by almost all software. As they scale, package registries become critical points of supply chain security. They also become leveraged points of attack. Most registries operate on dwindling funding from grants, donations, and in-kind resources while facing increased costs across every facet of their operation and development. Something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alpha-Omega project has been raising the alarm, funding security improvements, and exploring a revenue-generating options with the major package registries. This is a hard problem with multiple players and tradeoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go over the economic models underlying package registries, the security risks and expectations, and look at some of the revenue experiments happening today.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The gaming industry, outside of console and mobile games, is mainly focused on three operating systems: Windows, GNU/Linux, and macOS.
This leaves FreeBSD with a  library mostly restricted to  open-source native games. These restrictions may decrease the interest of new and current gaming users for FreeBSD as their main OS as they are accustomed to having access to a wider variety of games (as is the case for GNU/Linux ).
Today, thanks to a handful of contributors and through the use of Linuxulator or Wine FreeBSD users have the necessary tools to enjoy gaming :)
Firstly, the port of Steam, which allows us to run both GNU/Linux games on FreeBSD under a chroot, and the multiple ports of wine, wine-devel, and wine-proton, which will enable us to play Windows games under FreeBSD. Secondly In addition to these ports, the upstreaming first approach with Wine allowed us to quickly update the Wine version available after a release.
This talk will shed a light on the available compatibility tools  and how we can leverage these tools to improve the gaming experience on FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD has first tier level support in Valgrind. Valgrind on illumos works fairly well. They are both supported "out of the box" in upstream Valgrind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other BSDs are not in the picture, which is a shame since there aren't too many fundamental differences between the BSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about what needs to be done in order to be able to get Valgrind up and running on DragonFly/Net/Open BSD. I'd like it to be both a source of information for anyone that would like to work on Valgrind and also a source of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a promise that I will have the time to do this development work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk that I gave at Fosdem 2022 (video only, during Covid)
https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/valgrind_freebsd/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the upstream Valgrind web site
https://valgrind.org/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the upstream git repo
https://sourceware.org/git/valgrind.git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a repo that I used when I was adding arm64 support to FreeBSD Valgrind

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NetBSD 11 introduces a new MICROVM kernel that can boot in QEMU in about 10 ms, thanks to PVH support, MMIO VirtIO devices, and various low-level optimisations. Building on this foundation, we created &lt;a href="https://smolBSD.org"&gt;smolBSD&lt;/a&gt;, a meta-OS and microVM generator that assembles tiny, versatile and fully isolated services using the MICROVM kernel plus selected pieces from NetBSD and pkgsrc.
Recent work by Pierre “khorben” Pronchery enables even faster startup by embedding the root filesystem as an initrd-style RAMdisk.
This talk presents &lt;a href="https://smolBSD.org"&gt;smolBSD&lt;/a&gt;’s design, capabilities, and how it enables ultra-fast, minimal, and reproducible micro-services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

This talk shows IPS History (why it was created and how) What it currently can do. The Concepts used (Repositories, Packages, FMRI, Facets, Variants, and Manifests, History) and what you can do with them and what IPS does with them. And why Self-Assembly is a major factor in that.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Swift is a general-purpose programming language often associated with app development for the Apple ecosystem. Over the years, Swift has extended its reach and is now a cross-platform language with support for Linux, Windows, and more recently, Android. Now, we are bringing Swift to FreeBSD and there are truly devils in the details. How do you start porting a language to a new environment? How do you debug issues before you have a working debugger? This is the story of how we overcame challenges like these while porting Swift to FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that certain applications, such as firewalls, routers, and hardened web services, perform best on BSD systems. Yet Linux dominates cloud infrastructure, forcing users to either port these applications or run them as full BSD virtual machines, each requiring special handling and management. This talk presents &lt;code&gt;urunc&lt;/code&gt;, a container runtime for unikernels and single-application kernels that enables BSD workloads to run efficiently in Linux environments. &lt;code&gt;urunc&lt;/code&gt; executes BSD applications in tiny microVMs and software-based sandboxes while integrating them seamlessly with existing Linux container platforms. This allows Kubernetes and similar systems  to manage BSD workloads alongside Linux containers without extra effort or special handling. A live demo will walk through building, packaging, and deploying BSD applications with urunc, with initial performance metrics on startup time and network throughput, showing that BSD applications remain practical even in BSD-“hostile” environments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Optimising kernels and file systems for PostgreSQL, a cross-project talk</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="bsd-illumos-bhyve-openzfs">BSD, illumos, bhyve, OpenZFS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will:
* introduce the unusual I/O needs of databases and PostgreSQL's new I/O architecture and direction
* show how PostgreSQL works on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and illumos today
* compare those systems' available support for native asynchronous I/O with Windows and Linux
* speculate on the pathways that need to be drilled through their kernels to achieve the state of the art
* speculate on the API design constraints and options I see
* discuss OpenZFS's exciting new direct I/O and block cloning features and their relevance to PostgreSQL 
* show-and-tell some experimental patches for full-featured direct I/O on FreeBSD's UFS
* show-and-tell some experimental patches for PostgreSQL with FreeBSD's native AIO and &lt;code&gt;kqueue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to provide a database hacker's take on the I/O concerns that "go together" and explain how and why they are linked.  It is written for a cross-project kernel and file system hacker audience, a rare opportunity provided by this FOSDEM devroom.  The presentation begins with a high-level problem space overview, before diving down to user space, VFS and device levels to discuss the options as I see them.  It includes some exploratory patches developed over the past few years of working full time on PostgreSQL I/O, porting and testing on ~10 operating systems, and hacking on FreeBSD for fun and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a 25 minute talk, broken up into 5 subtopics consisting of 5 one-minute slides, and the pace will be fast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What databases want and why, a 30,000 foot overview &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User space programming interfaces for asynchronous I/O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel interfaces for asynchronous I/O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL on FreeBSD/ZFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using FreeBSD/UFS as a starting point for database/kernel interface exploration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;gotwebd is the web interface for browsing Git repositories provided as part of Game of Trees—a project grown out of the OpenBSD community whose goal is to develop a new version control system that relies on prior art, takes what makes Git's design great, leaves out the parts that make Git hard for us to use, and invents new parts for an end result that serves our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the most obvious features, such as browsing repositories, reading commit logs, and inspecting diffs, gotwebd has a few unique features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the privsep design and the use of sandboxing techniques on different operating systems; then the built-in SSH "web" authentication for access control, which also serves as protection against relentless AI scraping; and finally, the ability to directly serve static web content from a Git repository without the need for CI or external hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll walk through the design of gotwebd, its evolution over time, and present its unique features in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We live in a age where internet is a requirement for our every day routines, whether it is to work from home, keep in contact with our family or our own leisure. It is a common to hear about how some company we trusted with our data has been hacked, and all our data is now floating around the internet. Many of us take steps to increase the security of our laptops, and our mobile phones. Some of us reject the use of SAAS services (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Discord etc) and host our own, either on our own hardware or hardware rented in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this often leads us to assume that our local network is secure, thinking only about the security of our services and not the connectivity to them. Many routers issued to consumers by an ISP or bought often miss security patches (YMMV) and often reach EOL within a very short lifespan. It is also not uncommon for these routers to have their own custom configuration format, which is device specific, making migration to new hardware more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing OpenBSD, "free, functional and secure"! Any old hardware could become a router, that Raspberry Pi you have lying around? That old desktop you do not use anymore? OpenBSD comes with all the software you need for a router (and more!) within the base system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me, and lets discuss how to keep your network secure, and give you more control over your network.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CryptPad is a collaborative office-suite that is end-to-end encrypted and fully open-source. The project has been operating for over 10 years and is used to collaborate on millions of documents each month on the flagship instance cryptpad.fr. In this talk we will introduce the product and its suite of applications. We will highlight some recent achievements from the last year including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an updated look and feel;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a re-write of our server;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvements to office applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and a new CryptPad embedding API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also recap the financial situation of the project, and our plans looking ahead towards sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;2025 has been a crazy year for open source, self hosted collaboration. As in, everyone has woken up to the risks of having an entire economy depend on 3-4 big American tech firms. Well, we at Nextcloud have been working to solve that since we started in 2016 and the large roll-outs recently, of millions of users at various public sector organizations across Europe. And now suddenly everyone else starts talking about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we’re at FOSDEM, so all we care about is… features. That, and self hosting of course. It is more fun. And who doesn’t want to stay in control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like every year, I will go over everything we did in Nextcloud in the last year. Is it feasible to do that in a single talk? Of course not, but I’ll try anyway, and you can judge me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in Brussels!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Cloudillo — Beyond Self-Hosting: Building a New Generation of Collaborative Applications</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;“Privacy-invasive cloud services,” “isolated users” and “small, disconnected instances” are what comes to mind when we think of self-hosting. It gives users control, but it also isolates them, with each server becoming a separate island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloudillo.org/"&gt;Cloudillo&lt;/a&gt; changes this. It is a self-hosted application platform that makes collaboration extensible, privacy-preserving, and organic — letting groups and organizations collaborate freely across different installations without relying on any centralizing infrastructure,
while keeping their data private and under their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Cloudillo provides all the building blocks of a modern collaboration suite: file storage, real-time database, live editing, social interactions, and user identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s the kicker with Cloudillo? It is that these are not closed features, but open APIs developers can use to build new applications that integrate seamlessly into the platform. A built-in DNS + PKI-based identity layer enables people and organizations to connect securely, exchange data, and seamlessly
share both content and applications across independently hosted Cloudillo instances — without any third-party coordination service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudillo’s entire backend is delivered as a single 30MB Rust binary, with no external dependencies. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, and security. Developers can deploy it in minutes, extend it in Rust, or build applications in TypeScript, then immediately gain access to a global framework for
distributed collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short talk introduces the concept behind Cloudillo, explains its technical foundations, and demonstrates how developers can create their own apps — apps that reach beyond a single server, thanks to Cloudillo — the platform that aims to make privacy-first collaboration not just possible, but convenient and open for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Taiga is Spanish open-source project management software that was created in 2014.
After achieving success with over 20 million users, a rewrite is started in 2021 in order to modernise the application. However, this soon came to a halt: the original team is no longer able to continue the project.
So, after 10 years of development and with many users eagerly awaiting this sequel, is this the end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the magic of open source, the story continues. A French cooperative that was also working on Taiga, took the project under its wing, ready to start afresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us to discover the origins of Tenzu (formerly Taiga-Next), find out where we are now, and learn about our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Join me for a fast-paced tour of OpenProject’s most impactful updates over the past year—from powerful portfolio management enhancements to much requested service management features, such as internal work package notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will also spotlight our long-term tech strategy to bring real-time text collaboration to every corner of the platform, enabling teams to co-create work packages, meeting notes, and other project management artifacts with ease. Discover how we’re leveraging and extending BlockNote, the rich-text editor already powering applications like openDesk’s Notes and Mijn Bureau’s Docs, to bridge the gap between quick te sketches and fully-fledged project plans. We’ll also invite developers to explore our BlockNote extensions, making it easier than ever to integrate work and task management into their own platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, I will give an outlook on our strategy to help project teams to migration from Jira Data Center and Confluence to OpenProject and XWiki respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a user, contributor, or developer, this talk will inspire you to reimagine collaboration in open-source project management.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During their most recent “100-Day-Challenges”, teams from France, the Netherlands, and Germany collaborated to co-develop sovereign public sector IT. The Netherlands is using components from La Suite Numérique and openDesk to build MijnBureau, while French and German teams continue to work together on their workspace solutions. This session explores how these cross-border collaborations tackle technical and organisational challenges and enable interoperability between different national workspaces. By sharing experiences and lessons learned, we highlight the potential of coordinated European initiatives to strengthen digital sovereignty and co-develop resilient, citizen-focused public sector software across borders.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cristal is a modular, extensible, and embeddable Wiki User Interface built with Vue and TypeScript.
It offers a modern, polished interface using VueJS and supports offline and real-time editing.
Built to be data storage agnostic, it is embeddable in several existing collaboration and knowledge management solutions (e.g., XWiki, a local file system, a Nextcloud storage, or a GitHub repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will showcase how Cristal can be embedded seamlessly as a Nextcloud application, allowing Nextcloud administrators to provide knowledge management to their users in a few clicks.
In particular, I'll highlight how past design choices helped embed Cristal in Nextcloud. But also present a return of experience of the unexpected issues faced in the process.
I will also present other features developed this year (integration of the BlockNote editor, support for macros) and how they will benefit current and future Cristal users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Document interopability and conversion: it shouldn’t be that hard!</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="collaboration-and-content-management">Collaboration and content management</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is presented by Stephan Meijer (NL government, NLdoc/La Suite Docs) and Albert Krewinkel, maintainer of &lt;a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public administrations hold millions of documents trapped in formats that are hard to reuse and often fail WCAG requirements: PDFs, legacy Word templates, ad-hoc styles. At Logius, with the NLdoc project, we were tasked with turning those documents into accessible, reusable HTML and other open formats. Our first instinct was the obvious one: use Pandoc and wrap it with some pre- and post-processing. It worked… until it didn’t. Every new edge case, every new target editor, every new accessibility rule meant more custom glue code and brittle filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we flipped the problem: instead of chaining converters, we designed a JSON-based document Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with an OpenAPI specification and built dedicated conversion services around it. That AST now sits at the centre of a small ecosystem: PDFs and DOCX files are converted into the AST, and from there into editors such as Tiptap and BlockNote, or directly into formats such as HTML. Support for ODT, Markdown and EPUB is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same AST also powers the NLdoc Tiptap-based editor, where authors get real-time accessibility validation and can export to accessible formats. It also powers the import functionality in La Suite (Docs), the FR–DE–NL sovereign collaboration stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll walk through that journey: why "just use Pandoc" wasn’t enough, what our AST looks like, how we wired it into a queue-based microservice architecture, and how this approach turns document conversion from a one-off migration hack into an interoperability layer for accessible, sovereign collaboration tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent versions of the document specification are available at &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/logius/nldoc/spec/document/-/releases"&gt;the Releases page of its repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several converters are available in &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/logius/nldoc"&gt;the NLdoc GitLab group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The import API for La Suite Docs is published at &lt;a href="https://github.com/docspecio/api"&gt;github.com/docspecio/api&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The La Suite Docs application itself is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs"&gt;github.com/suitenumerique/docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc website (pandoc.org)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc"&gt;Pandoc repository (github.com/jgm/pandoc)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The new Collabora Office brings a beautiful, ergonomic suite, based on LibreOffice to the desktop. Come hear why, in 2026 we're creating a native local application. Hear about the limitations of Web APIs, and checkout some of the metrics we have gathered around how people collaborate on-line, and the engineering decisions that flow from that.
Hear about our new approaches to handle collaboration, off-line, conflicts, and forthcoming protocol to negotiate transitions between co-editing, sharing, on-line and off-line.
Finally catch up with the latest in UX research, interoperabiltiy and feature improvements as well as seeing how to get involved with the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Collabora Online introduced a new feature that lets users start a slideshow for everyone who has joined the presentation. This feature can be used during meetings where, instead of sharing the screen to present something, the user can now just start the slideshow inside the presentation document.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>We Need to Support Authors Better to Deliver Accessible Content</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, the We4Authors initiative united several content management tools (mostly open source) to identify and document accessibility best practices in preparation for the European Accessibility Act. It was the most coordinated effort to help content authors produce accessible digital content at scale. Yet, despite the groundwork, only the recommendations have not been widely adopted. The Web Almanac confirms what many suspected: web accessibility has not meaningfully improved in preparation for the Act’s introduction. https://events.drupal.org/europe2020/sessions/top-cms-tools-are-working-together-build-more-inclusive-world.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this was built on or extending ideas in Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0. https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the context has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence—especially small, local language models—offers a new opportunity to deliver accessibility guidance where it’s needed most: at the moment of authoring. CMSs can leverage open source AI to suggest accessible alternatives, improve media descriptions, and identify structural issues in real time—without sending user data to third parties or compromising privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how we can:
    •   Revisit the ATAG 2.0 &amp;amp; We4Authors guidance and align it with today’s AI capabilities. https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/
    •   Integrate small language models within CMS authoring environments.
    •   Collaborate across open source communities building on the Open Web Alliance
    •   Build shared datasets, APIs, and modules to improve author support and accessible defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility progress requires shared effort, not just compliance checklists. Let’s use open collaboration and new tools to help every author publish content that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Integrating open source telephony into a digital workplace</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digital Workplaces increasingly consolidate collaborative tools, yet telephony often remains isolated and difficult to integrate. User needs show that a unified interface, including VoIP, simplifies the user experience while reducing vendors and costs. Once treated as a silo, telephony is now starting to become a central component of collaborative platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will cover the key technical integration points for adding a a softphone application and a VoIP calling service to a Digital Workplace: embedding a web-based calling client into an existing interface, managing SSO and account provisioning, unifying call histories and presence information, ensuring interoperability between system notifications and platform notifications, and adapting the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will illustrate these points with a concrete example using the SIP client Linphone and the SIP server Flexisip, demonstrating how an open source VoIP solution can be technically integrated into a collaborative platform: adapting WebRTC to SIP, handling push notifications for incoming calls, retrieving call logs via an API, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to show how telephony can become a modular building block for collaboration rather than an isolated tool, and why this approach is essential for open source Digital Workplaces like Nextcloud, OpenDesk, or eXo Platform to offer a complete solution. It is only by combining the strengths of different specialized open-source software editors that it may be possible to compete with major players in the collaborative-software market, such as Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a world where custom JSON and binary formats thrive, HTML and XML continue to provide an open and universal system for sharing structured information. But these languages are plagued by decades of insufficient tooling which makes working with them tenuous at best. The HTML API in WordPress has introduced a safe, reliable, and convenient interface for parsing HTML to address a number of these issues; in the process it unlocks new worlds of interoperability and translation for human-authored content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the streaming interface of this new processing pipeline and how it can be replicated in other languages and platforms. It will highlight how re-embracing HTML and other markup languages can improve interoperability between platforms and how better tooling can make working with these legacy formats less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a spec-compliant DOM parser is useful, but a spec-compliant and minimally-allocating streaming parser can be a game-changer in high-demand and low-latency applications.  Come hear the fascinating war stories from developing such a system, how design played a key role, and ways it has already unlocked novel and high-quality features.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, we've revived the idea of a student wiki at  MFF CUNI, where the last attempt had languished for years. We'll talk about the technical side – choosing a platform, the problems we encountered, and our extensive modifications – as well as the organisational side, from getting institutional backing for our project to actually getting student contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of automated migrations and follow-up manual edits, we've consolidated a number of older, semi-abandoned platforms at the faculty to the new wiki. The entire software stack is FLOSS while also allowing integration with other university systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the current state of the wiki at &lt;a href="https://wiki.matfyz.cz"&gt;https://wiki.matfyz.cz&lt;/a&gt;, and our source code at &lt;a href="https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/matfyzak/wiki/"&gt;https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/matfyzak/wiki/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration in the physical world can learn from the tools software developers use. Forgejo is an excellent code forge that can be repurposed for collaborative project management or a simple TODO app. This presentation explains how a PWA can be built on top of Forgejo by generating a binding for a mobile app from the api description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reusing Forgejo as a backend, development time on a backend is saved and a fallback frontend exists too. The advantage lies in the ability to create a dedicated frontend for particular workflows while retaining the proven parts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I am currently designing my custom Lighthouse tracker board based on the Lattice ICE40HX8K-CB132 FPGA and TS4231 Light to Digital Converter. The board is done using KiCad and supports up to 32 sensors. The board also has an RP2040 microcontroller used as a PC interface and an ICM-45686 IMU.
The firmware for the RP2040 and gateware for the FPGA have been forked from Bitcraze, on the host PC you will need libsurvive. A possible future wireless extension is based on the nRF52833 used by SlimeVR Butterfly and Tundra trackers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces ElemRV, a lightweight open-source RISC-V microcontroller designed for accessibility and adaptability. We'll trace the project's origins and its first tape-outs using IHP's Open PDK, demonstrating how open-source silicon can move from concept to fabrication.
The presentation covers ElemRV's architecture and key components, highlighting the design choices that shaped the microcontroller. We'll walk through the complete ASIC flow - from RTL source code to tape-out-ready GDSII files - demystifying the process of creating custom silicon with open-source tools.
The session concludes with the roadmap for future tape-outs and planned enhancements, inviting community collaboration on this libre hardware project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The f8 is an architecture for small embedded systems optimized for memory efficiency - regarding both code and data memory. We present the current state of the architecture (including the f8l variant for reduced core area), reference implementation, and the toolchain, which is based on the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I have been working hands-on with FPGAs for open-source projects in distributed storage and networking. More recently, I have been interested to FPGA applications in finance and ultra–low-latency systems. Along the way, I found out that several open-source projects were immensely helpful, which made me realize that engineers and developers who want to get started could benefit from the same resources. This talk will cover the fundamentals of how, why, and where FPGAs are used in financial applications. Naturally, this talk will also highlight key open-source projects that can help the community build FPGA-based projects in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>From Specification to Silicon: Building a Tapeout Ready Custom eFPGA with the FABulous 2.0 Framework</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will explore version 2.0 of the FABulous embedded FPGA (eFPGA) Framework and show how to design, implement, and simulate an embedded FPGA fabric. Starting from a high-level specification, we work towards a tiled and optimised, tapeout-ready physical layout (GDSII), in just a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FABulous is an easy-to-use, free and open-source eFPGA framework covering all aspects of what an FPGA ecosystem requires, from high-level design and layout to simulation and CAD tool integration. Version 2.0 introduces the ability to automatically generate a tiled and optimised physical layout, simplifying chip-level integration significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework supports extensive customisation, including user-defined primitives, I/O cells, and integrating complex blocks such as CPU cores or ADCs. It has demonstrated superior area density in both standard-cell and custom-cell-based flows and has been validated across more than 15 manufactured chips, spanning 28 nm to 180 nm, including open (SKY130, IHP130, GF180) and industry (TSMC 180, 130, 28) PDKs. This demonstrates its practicality and adaptability across a wide range of design contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The use of programmable logic devices, such as FPGAs, requires a range of software tools, from editors for HDL design to the place and route software that maps the design to the physical device and the software that handles the actual configuration process. 
These are often combined into a coherent IDE to improve efficiency and ease the learning process by offering smooth transitions between the different stages of development, from writing HDL via synthesis, simulation and implementation to the configuration of the device. In the world of FPGAs, these IDEs are mostly proprietary software, developed and owned by the few big FPGA vendors, that only support their own hardware. This means that once design flows are established around one vendor’s software suite, switching to a different vendor’s hardware becomes a tedious or even entirely unworkable task.
For years now, pioneers in the open-source community have been steadily working to bridge the gap between commercial and open design tools, to the point that competitive solutions now exist for many aspects of FPGA design. With all the building blocks now available we in the FEntwumS project are now working to integrate a whole range of these tools into one coherent IDE that is as vendor-agnostic as possible and, most importantly, free and open-source.
As a representative case study to validate and benchmark this platform, we integrate OpenEye, an open-source and fully FPGA-compatible neural network accelerator developed within the consortium. Its scalable architecture enables us to evaluate the robustness of the toolchain across different device classes and design configurations, testing synthesis behavior, implementation quality and runtime characteristics. By using OpenEye as a practical test vehicle, we ensure transparent evaluation, reproducibility and alignment with the open-source philosophy that underpins the entire project. 
In this talk, we will present our approach, our current progress, issues we have encountered and our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;2025 marks a turning point for European mobility data. A significant update to the Multimodal Travel Information Services (MMTIS) regulation takes effect in March 2025. In parallel, ERA and DG MOVE have initiated a coordinated overhaul of all Transmodel-based standards, and a newly agreed TSI Telematics revision (November 2025) sets the direction for railway digitalisation from 2026 onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk brings together Yann Seimandi (DG MOVE) and Stefan Jugelt (ERA) to give developers and open-source contributors a clear picture of the new regulatory and technical landscape. We will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s new in MMTIS 2.0
- How NAPCORE supports harmonised, cross-border mobility data
- Upgrading Transmodel-based standards to European Norms
- Specification of EUDIT, the new Transmodel-based Booking API
- Development of EFIP, a unified European NeTEx Fares Profile
- Alignment of TSI Telematics with the broader multimodal ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will gain insight into the impact on APIs and data models and how open-source communities can contribute to Europe’s mobility infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Despite EU-level initiatives, the availability and quality of open data on public transport differs wildly between member states. I'll talk about the situation in the Czech Republic from the perspective of someone who's been fighting for data availability for the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll focus mostly on timetables, briefly covering the history of the Czech Republic's centralised system, the current state of affairs after multiple lawsuits, and the (hopefully) rosy future. I'll also talk about other datasets, like real-time positions and train composition, and also about my experience trying to fit Czech data into existing open standards and software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present why and how I started writing Bimba, a public transport application for my city back in 2017. The talk will show major turning points in the journey: when the city started providing open data, when Bimba no longer worked in single place, when Transitous was integrated enabling not only global coverage but also global routing, and meeting people and ideas during last year's RaOT track at FOSDEM and the first Open Transport unconference. I will also present how—with crowdsourcing—Bimba is now also a part of the community and finally, I will hint to what may come in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Not every public transport agency publishes real-time delay information, and some do not even have it.
Some of the proprietary transit apps have used user-submitted data to bridge this gap for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores how we can do the same in open-source apps, based on &lt;a href="https://transitous.org/"&gt;Transitous&lt;/a&gt;.
It covers the steps from collecting the vehicle positions from people's phones in an ethical way, to deriving the delay and to integrating the results with existing routing services and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to allowing for the independent collection of real-time information, the components written for this project (&lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/jbb/transitous-gps-collector/"&gt;gps-collector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/jbb/gtfs-delay-tracker"&gt;gtfs-delay-tracker&lt;/a&gt;) could potentially be useful for community buses, heritage railways and smaller public transport agencies with limited budgets.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In late 2025, &lt;a href="https://dbinfrago.com"&gt;DB InfraGO&lt;/a&gt; - Germany's state owned operator of railway infrastructure - released its &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbinfrago/openstation-docs"&gt;“OpenStation“ API&lt;/a&gt;, the new single source of truth for train station data. The API (or as some users have put it: "glorified collection of XML files") is based on the european &lt;a href="https://netex-cen.eu"&gt;NeTEx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://siri-cen.eu"&gt;SIRI&lt;/a&gt; standards, and its contents are released as CC0 (public domain), a first for Deutsche Bahn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we want to share our experiences with NeTEx and SIRI from a data producer's perspective, highlight some benefits and challenges of our new API, explain its intended role within the transport data ecosystem, and discuss our future plans for OpenStation. Last but not least, we would like to hear your thoughts and feedback on our new API.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenTripPlanner is a mature, open-source engine for multimodal journey planning across public transport, walking, cycling, micromobility, and driving/park and ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It supports datasources on multiple different format (NeTEx, GTFS), consumes hundreds of realtime updates per second to timetable data while delivering fast response times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these capabilities it is important to map real world as accurate as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you manage time-traveling trains, ghost buses, levitating trains, and how long is a staircase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inconsistent data, outliers and quirky rules go head to head with configuration and algorithms in a battle to answer the questions, what is the best journey from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With a smartphone, users nowadays can plan public transport journeys spontaneously and react to incidents in real-time by changing itineraries on the fly, even proactively. Algorithms and UIs however are still clinging to the notion of an upfront query and journey plan that the user is blindly following as long as is physically possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to turn-by-turn directions for car drivers, we propose to focus on showing the user only the next best step they should take according to the real-time situation in order to eventually get to their destination, and not an entire, fixed journey plan. Instead of just the destination arrival time, we compute the probability distribution of destination arrival of the user, taking into account reliability of transfers and alternative continuations. Simulations show that on average, a user will arrive earlier than when following a classical journey planner, not only in the case of delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype can be used at https://tespace.traines.eu/ with source code available at https://github.com/traines-source/time-space-train-planner. 
TeSpace relies on https://transitous.org/ and the https://github.com/motis-project/motis API for global public transport timetable coverage (where available). Let's also talk about how to advance these two beyond classical pareto-optimal journeys!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Long ago I wanted to build an app for the local bike sharing system in my city, only to realize open data was not publicly available. Out of frustration, I built a free and open API for others to create applications, visualizations and research using bike sharing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward today and thanks to the community, the &lt;a href="https://citybik.es"&gt;CityBikes project&lt;/a&gt; supports more than 800 cities all around the world and our API powers bike sharing transportation apps across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"open" data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the introduction of open data standards like GBFS (at this time, approx 60% of our feeds) there's a fair amount of systems that are not accessible outside of their apps. The reality of open data shatters once you look too close into it: cursed APIs, broken feeds and HTML tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to change that by providing developers, researchers and organizations the tools and resources to bridge this gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share the motivations behind the project, what it’s like to maintain it after more than a decade, and dive into the new tools and historical data systems we’re building.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Scaling Mobility Flow Visualization: Origin-Destination Data with DuckDB, Flowmap.gl, and SQLRooms</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Visualizing origin-destination (OD) mobility data—commuter flows, transit ridership, freight traffic—is essential for transport planning, but datasets can contain millions of flows that overwhelm traditional mapping approaches. In this talk, I'll present open-source tools for preparing and visualizing large-scale OD data interactively in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll introduce &lt;a href="https://flowmap.gl"&gt;flowmap.gl&lt;/a&gt;, a WebGL-based flow map layer for &lt;a href="https://deck.gl"&gt;deck.gl&lt;/a&gt; that renders geographic movements with adaptive clustering and filtering. To handle large datasets, I'll demonstrate &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/sqlrooms-flowmap/"&gt;sqlrooms-flowmap&lt;/a&gt;, a Python tool that uses &lt;a href="https://duckdb.org"&gt;DuckDB&lt;/a&gt; with spatial extensions to prepare OD data for tiled serving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical clustering&lt;/strong&gt;: locations are grouped at each zoom level using pixel-radius clustering, creating a hierarchy where clusters merge as users zoom out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nested Hilbert indexing&lt;/strong&gt;: OD pairs are indexed using a space-filling curve that preserves locality, enabling efficient range queries for tile-based serving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatio-temporal aggregation&lt;/strong&gt;: flows are aggregated to match zoom-based clustering, with optional temporal bucketing by hour/day/week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prepared data can be visualized using a demo app built with &lt;a href="https://sqlrooms.org"&gt;SQLRooms&lt;/a&gt;, a browser-based analytics framework powered by DuckDB, where users can query and explore flows using SQL alongside interactive maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll show a live demo using Switzerland's &lt;a href="https://www.are.admin.ch/are/en/home/transport-and-infrastructure/data/npvm.html"&gt;National Passenger Transport Model (NPVM)&lt;/a&gt;—an open dataset of passenger flows across the Swiss transport network—demonstrating the full pipeline from raw data to interactive visualization, all using open-source tools that can run locally without cloud dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Promoting a consistent open source workflow for railway analysis by connecting OSRD and SUMO</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the past two years the Open Source Railway Designer (OSRD) has been presented at FOSDEM. The integrations shown there sparked our interest in testing OSRD ourselves in a practical context. In initial studies we used OSRD to evaluate capacity effects on highly congested corridors, including a scenario with a speed increase in rail freight transport. These studies show that OSRD provides a solid basis for open, reproducible capacity studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the next crucial step in the planning process is microscopic operational simulation, which can be used to evaluate the effect of timetables and operating procedures over time and during disrupted operations. This component is not yet part of the OSRD workflow. To address precisely this gap, we have investigated how the agent-based tool SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) can be applied for railway operational issues. SUMO enables a detailed representation of vehicle movements along an infrastructure under a given timetable and allows delays and different operating modes to be modelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case study on the Frankfurt underground, we used SUMO to analyse various operational concepts. This included simulations in fixed-block and moving-block operation as well as the modelling of a driverless shunting. The results show that SUMO delivers precise insights into the dynamic system behaviour and provides relevant key figures for operational evaluation - while also exposing the framework conditions and limitations of the current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we discuss the potential of linking OSRD and SUMO: from open infrastructure modelling and timetable mapping to microscopic operational simulation. We would like to outline how a consistent open source workflow for railway and light rail systems could be created and invite the community to develop it further together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You're a railway infrastructure manager. A train operator calls up, and would like to fit a new train in the existing schedule. It should leave at 10am, and it's 8am. How do you make sure this new train won't cause any traffic jams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, we made a proof of concept for this complex problem (&lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/rot_osrd/"&gt;I've already talked about it in this track&lt;/a&gt;). Since then, we've successfully made it production-ready, and we've had users for a year now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have faced new challenges, both expected and unexpected. We have made some mistakes and learned from them. We have stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The public transport sector is mostly a traditional sector with an oligopolistic market situation for system solutions for travel planning and ticketing. The lock-in and dependency to few system vendors in Europe stifles innovation and impedes initiatives to make public transport more attractive. But in the Nordic countries, public transport agencies (PTA) choose an alternative path to overcome system vendor dependency through open source and by engaging in community development. Our qualitative study interviewed 13 persons from 5 different PTAs in the Nordics entails an alternative pathway where they digitally disrupted the regional or national public transport market. They choose to utilise open source for central components and engage in community development to achieve political ambitions to make public transportation an attractive alternative to car travelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study presents a model on how organisations can co-evolve with the open source community through long-term engagement to access state-of-the-art digital technology and foster innovation. The model depicts a cumulative process that yields better opportunities the longer and deeper the engagement becomes. This enables digital transformation outcomes such as access to a global pool of knowledge, agile and adaptive value-creation, open innovations processes, partnership and synergy opportunities. The talk will present the findings from the study and how the model can be used as a tool to better understand and depicts the organisational alignment process, the inner mechanism and the possible transformative outcome of engaging in open source community development. Our findings demonstrate that also large traditional organisation within the transport sector can partially foster digital transformation capabilities through departmental engagement in community development which can radiate to other parts of the organisation. This entails alternative pathways for traditional organisation that are under demand to digitally transform. But this requires sustained resource investment and loyalty to community objectives to gain influence and trust, to access deeper collaboration and innovation opportunities. The talk will discuss both obstacles, possibilities and strategies that organisations can adopt when engaging in open source community development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After a successful beta run, the HackerTrain to FOSDEM is back! This time we are going distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how we organized a train trip for an unknown number of groups of unknown people that travel on different dates and on different routes to the same event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lessons learnt on how to manage such chaos on a zero budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the actual train rides went (hopefully with pictures!) – we expect several lines from all corners of Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lessons learnt on those routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the next steps and the long-term goals for the HackerTrain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this beta run of the HackerTrain to FOSDEM we hope to uncover also the potential for (massive) group travel to (FOSS) events, as well as the hurdles that we still need to overcome to make affordable, easy, comfortable and engaging cross-border public travel possible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are almost half a dozen new opensource webmail systems that you can host yourself now, after a decade of little development. One of them is so good that after testing it for my work, I've grown to use it almost every day privately. Several of their developers attend FOSDEM this year and may talk about their software in depth, this talk covers them as a group. It's mostly for an audience that (may) want to self-host (again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets the new webmail systems apart from the old ones, how do they compare to Google's and Microsoft's polished offerings, how do they compare to each other? I'll talk about all of that, and since I am a standards wonk there is a risk that I may digress into how well or badly they use the standards.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://opencloud.eu/en"&gt;OpenCloud&lt;/a&gt; is a production-ready Open Source "Drive" solution for storing and sharing files, and we are adding a Groupware stack to all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to present our concept (especially regarding the integration of the other services in our stack, namely OpenCloud Drive and &lt;a href="https://opentalk.eu/en"&gt;OpenTalk&lt;/a&gt;) as well as what we have so far in terms of our implementation, which extensively uses JMAP in its middleware, in combination with a &lt;a href="https://stalw.art/"&gt;Stalwart&lt;/a&gt; backend that does a lot of the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole stack is &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencloud-eu/"&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, implemented in Go and TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A fast-forward dialog about the state of email and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our talk we will point out real examples and funny stories as well as some interesting tools and how to combine them into a holistic mail security concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover famous things like the need of unencrypted Pop3, FOM~~O~~E - the fear of missing email, postmasters nightmare with dmarc, dkim, spf  in between security and comfort focused users, arc - the layered chain of postmasters of trust - and many more. Yes, something with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as bad as it maybe sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally we will talk about the perfect Ratatouille for mail infrastructures - covering various established and exciting new flavors and spices. In other words, how to tie up open source components for a perfect mail security infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Even Signal took years to get it right, and Matrix is not quite there yet: Implementing a multi-device chat system that supports not only reliable encryption, but also reliable deletion of messages also known as "Forward Secrecy". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll present a new "Autocrypt 2 certificate" specification draft, that originated from the &lt;a href="https://chatmail.at"&gt;chatmail&lt;/a&gt; community and its supporters.  The draft is built upon &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9580.html"&gt;the modern RFC9850 OpenPGP standard&lt;/a&gt; and aims to to supports encryption that is safe against attackers that collect all in-transit traffic and then &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;try to use a prospective future Quantum computer to decrypt all collected messages, or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;try to recover deleted messages after they get hold of a device/private key. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft Autocrypt2 certificate specification is designed to be usable by any Internet Messaging system and is intended for submission to IETF early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk covers Rspamd development from March to December 2025, focusing on four major areas. First, HTML fuzzy hashing - a new algorithm that generates structural fingerprints from DOM trees, enabling detection of phishing emails that reuse legitimate templates with modified links. Second, multi-class Bayesian classification that extends the traditional spam/ham model to support up to 20 categories (newsletters, transactional mail, promotions) with single-call Redis lookups. Third, protocol improvements including TCP transport for fuzzy queries and encrypted ZIP archive handling via libarchive. Fourth, neural network refactoring into a provider-based architecture for combining multiple feature sources. We'll also discuss practical experience using LLM tools for code generation, documentation, and PR review during this development cycle - what worked, what didn't, and where human judgment remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Cascading Spy Sheets: The Privacy &amp; Security Implications of CSS in Emails</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) enable visual customization of HTML emails. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: in this talk, we reveal how CSS creates serious privacy and security vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that CSS facilitates fingerprinting and tracking in HTML emails, even undermining the privacy protections offered by email clients that use proxy services to access remote resources. These tracking capabilities enable targeted phishing and spam campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More critically, we present a novel scriptless attack that exploits container queries, lazy-loading fonts, and adaptive ligatures to exfiltrate arbitrary plaintext from PGP-encrypted emails. The attack targets mixed-context scenarios—cases where email clients render both trusted (encrypted) and untrusted (attacker-controlled) HTML content within the same message view. We successfully demonstrate end-to-end exfiltration of PGP-encrypted text from Thunderbird, along with two other major email clients that permit such content mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings expose fundamental gaps in current isolation mechanisms, demonstrating that post-Efail mitigations remain insufficient against CSS-based attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Open Buro: Integrating applications to create a Smart Platform Experience</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Email service is at the core of a collaborative suite. And, good news, FOSS solutions for all collaborative uses have an unprecedented maturity.
But Europe still faces a critical dependence on Office 365, with strategic and financial costs that are now undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is no longer functional, &lt;strong&gt;FOSS solutions suffer from an architectural limitation : a simple SSO does not create a platform&lt;/strong&gt;.
To offer a true Smart Platform Experience around the mail, we must go beyond silos solutions and build deep, consistent, cross-functional integration between independent services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on the integration of DINUM's LaSuite into Twake.AI&lt;/strong&gt;, we will analyze what is missing to offer a “Smart Platform Experience”: a standardized cross-functional layer that brings together independent services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel Paccoud, director of lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr&lt;/strong&gt;, will comment this integration and the perspectives he identifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see how such a standard can enable a modular ecosystem, where each application remains independent but can interoperate deeply, forming a credible and sustainable sovereign workplace. This is the mission of the Open Buro consortium: to &lt;strong&gt;create an open foundation where architecture becomes a political act&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/suitenumerique/messages"&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt; is a project from &lt;a href="https://anct.gouv.fr/"&gt;ANCT&lt;/a&gt;, a French government agency that aims to bring secure and modern tools to small rural towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll introduce the MIT-licensed project and explain how the specific requirements of public servant inboxes led to a unique design, breaking free to legacy protocols like IMAP.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you're following along with email standards, you know about JMAP:  it replaces both IMAP and SMTP-for-sending, eliminating a lot of weird and dated protocol design with HTTP and JSON.  It makes easy things easy, and also enables fast, efficient offline synchronization.  It's not a new email system, just a new access protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But did you know that JMAP can also handle your calendars, your address book, your files, and plenty more things to come?  This talk will describe JMAP extensions for those systems: what they are, how they work, and why you should be excited.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Stalwart: Can Open Source do Gmail-scale Email?</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how Gmail, Yahoo, and Apple iCloud manage to host hundreds of millions of email accounts reliably? How do they store petabytes of messages, survive hardware failures without losing data, and keep spam at bay across billions of daily deliveries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores how to design and operate a large-scale email system using Stalwart, an open-source mail server built from the ground up for distributed deployments. Using a 1,024-node cluster as a concrete example, we will examine the architectural patterns that make planet-scale email possible, and how similar approaches are used by providers such as Apple iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session covers the full stack of distributed email challenges: storing and indexing messages across a cluster, running spam and phishing filtering at scale without becoming a bottleneck, managing distributed MTA queues for reliable delivery, and load balancing IMAP, JMAP, and SMTP traffic across nodes. We will also look at how Stalwart handles cluster coordination, orchestration, and autoscaling, how to reason about failure scenarios before they occur, and how to adapt a deployment to fluctuating load in dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with a practical understanding of how modern distributed email systems are built and operated, and how to apply these principles using open-source technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Traditional email servers were designed for a different era. They work great for small deployments but struggle at scale: Maildir breaks at 100k+ users, configuration changes require service reloads, and a single blacklisted IP blocks everyone on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wildduck.email/"&gt;WildDuck&lt;/a&gt; takes a different approach. Built on MongoDB and Node.js, it treats email as a modern distributed systems problem. This talk explores the architectural decisions behind WildDuck and the lessons learned running it in production with 100,000+ accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dovecot 2.4 removed one of the mail server's most outstanding features: being able to replicate between two servers, even in an active-active scenario if desired. The actual sync code stays in place, but the replication orchestrator was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the same release introduces improvements to two APIs: the event API now allows reacting to pretty much anything happening in Dovecot using an HTTP server, while the doveadm HTTP allows to trigger synchronization with another server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have a look on Dovecot 2.3's implementation of replication, checking out alternative solutions to replication to finally look into a Golang-based solution that does not require forking the mail server codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk presents a mail migration project at the University of Bonn where more than 60 000 mail accounts have been migrated from a monolithic proprietary mail system to a modular FOSS-based solution. The used components for the new setup include amongst others:
* &lt;a href="http://www.postfix.org/"&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://dovecot.org/"&gt;Dovecot&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://www.rspamd.com/"&gt;Rspamd&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://www.sogo.nu/"&gt;SOGo&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://www.openldap.org/"&gt;OpenLDAP&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://mariadb.org/"&gt;MariaDB Galera&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://docs.keydb.dev/"&gt;KeyDB&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://www.keepalived.org/"&gt;keepalived&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://www.memcached.org/"&gt;memcached&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation provides an insight into the motivation, planning, chosen migration approach, overcome difficulties and first operational experience with the new system. Finally an outlook is given on upcoming planned developments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gatling is a framework for performance testing and Apache James contributors had been providing a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for easily writing IMAP performance tests. We also wrote JMAP benchmarks using Gatling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the inner working of Gatling, the architecture of the IMAP DSL, key contributions to Yahoo's imapnio library, the toolbox for performance testing Apache James (including provisionning data), and present related results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also present how it completes other performance-related tools of the Apache James eco-system: Grafana metrics, async-profiler flame graphs (and contributions to the FOSS eco-system it did lead to!), JMH (Java Micro-benchmark Harness) tests for MIME4J...&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Recent Rockchip SoCs (namely, those of the RK35 generation) integrate dedicated IP blocks for video capture and image signal processing. Yet support for these blocks in upstream Linux remains one of the last missing pieces in an otherwise well-supported SoC lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will begin with an overview of the contributions that have already landed in mainline, provide an update on the change sets that are currently in flight, and outline the remaining work needed to fully enable video capture and camera functionality on RK35xy SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk describes our in-race-car video camera hardware and the open-source software that underpins our sub 200ms Glass to Glass streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss interfacing to V4l2 (in various modes) from memory safe languages (that &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; C) and also the problems and advantages of accessing a chip specific encoder API.   I will have a solid grumble about the increasing complexity and opacity of the linux media APIs and a moan about how much I miss Plan9 style thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use examples from the following open source projects (among others)
https://github.com/pipe/whipi
https://github.com/pipe/v4l2Reader
https://github.com/steely-glint/PhonoSDK&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a range of unusual programming techniques that were used in the development of a state-of-the-art H.264 software decoder (https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264), to drastically reduce code and binary size and improve speed. The techniques are applicable to other audio/video codecs, and will be presented as HOWTOs to help participants use them in their projects. It complements my talks from the last 2 years at FOSDEM, and will focus this time on (i) using YAML output as a cornerstone for debugging, testing and data-analysis, (ii) optimizing the infamous CABAC serial arithmetic decoder, and (iii) exploring the factors behind the choice of C for high-performance SIMD code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The global software ecosystem has moved to richer and richer web experience. With the addition of A/V APIs, webgl acceleration, rich media APIs, RTC and, more recently, the wide open field of web assembly-supported features, more or and more of the typical user interaction and applications happens within the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all processing is meant to happen browser-side. In particular, when dealing with media with potentially large resolutions, exotic formats or complex compute-heavy effects, to provide a full user experience, it might be required to move back and forth between the browser and a backend server processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this comes with its own sets of challenges: what kind of processing is well suited in the browser? How to best interface a browser-based API with a backend-end based one? How is it possible to transpose a user experience that is built on javascript APIs available in the browser to a backend-based processing where these APIs typically have no bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, which is based on some of the challenges faced when building Descript, a feature-rich web-based video editor, we will review some of the technologies that are available to help interfacing web and backend processing, illustrate some of the challenges that these pose and also solve and explore potential future solutions using recent or prospective technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Streamplace (https://stream.place) has been spending the last two years developing a novel form of decentralized public broadcast to facilitate a live video layer for Bluesky's AT Protocol. The basis of this system are C2PA-signed one-second MP4 files that can be deterministically muxed together into larger segments for archival. This talk will give a technical overview of how all the pieces fit together and show off how our freely-licensed media server facilitates cooperative livestreaming infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This joint talk by DeepComputing and contributors from the VLC project showcases how intelligent media playback and real-time audio processing are becoming a reality on open RISC-V hardware. We demonstrate VLC running Whisper (speech-to-text) and Qwen (text-to-text LLM) on ESWIN’s EIC7702 SoC with a 40-TOPS NPU, achieving practical AI-enhanced multimedia performance entirely on RISC-V.
We will walk through the porting process, performance tuning across CPU/NPU, audio pipeline integration, and the technical challenges of enabling real-time inference on today’s RISC-V AI PCs.
The session will also preview our upcoming 16-core RISC-V platform and discuss how VLC’s evolving AI support roadmap aligns with this next generation of RISC-V hardware. Together, we outline the upstreaming efforts required to bring AI-accelerated playback, real-time captioning, translation, and other intelligent media features to the broader open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After spending the past 10 years (and more!) working with WebRTC, and even more than that with SIP/RTP, I decided to have a look at the efforts happening within the standardization community on how to leverage QUIC for real-time media. This led me to studying not only QUIC itself, but also RTP Over QUIC (RoQ) and Media Over QUIC (MoQT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my learning process, I started writing a QUIC library, called imquic. While it can (mostly) be used as a generic QUIC/WebTransport library, I also implemented native support within the library for both RoQ and MoQT, as a testbed to use for prototyping the new protocols in an experimental way. This presentation will introduce these new protocols and the imquic library implementing them, talking a bit about the existing demos and the proof-of-concept integration in the Janus WebRTC Server for QUIC-to-WebRTC translation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As of the 3.10 release, the public domain (Unlicense) media server MistServer (https://mistserver.org) gained a new feature: the ability to mix raw (UYVY pixel format only, for now) video streams and raw audio streams (PCM) with resizing, overlapping, aspect ratio keeping and support for non-uniform frame rates between sources. Not only that - but it's even possible to control the configuration in real time without any downtime.
This talk shows off what is possible, and explains how we did it in technical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covered topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to efficiently store a multi-frame raw video buffer in shared memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronization handling between multiple sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling sources being added or removed without interruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we implemented decoding and encoding between raw and encoded formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user interface that was built to control the mixing in a user-friendly way (though "raw" control through JSON is also possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nextflow is a workflow manager that enables scalable and reproducible workflows. Nextflow is complemented by the nf-core community effort that aims at developing and supporting a curated collection of Nextflow pipelines, developed according to a well-defined standard, and their components.
Since its inception, nf-core has set rigorous standards for documentation, testing, versioning and packaging of workflows, ensuring that pipelines can be "run anywhere" with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help adhere to the standards, nf-core comes along with &lt;a href="https://github.com/nf-core/tools"&gt;nf-core/tools&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source toolkit designed to support the Nextflow pipeline ecosystem. These include tools for the creation, testing, and sharing of Nextflow workflows and components. The nf-core tooling is central to all &lt;a href="https://nf-co.re/"&gt;nf-core&lt;/a&gt; pipelines, but it can also be used to develop pipelines outside the nf-core community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipelines and the tooling are actively maintained by the nf-core contributors and by the nf-core infrastructure team (supported by the CRG, SciLifeLabs, QBIC, and Seqera). This infrastructure provides everything: from pipeline templates to management of nf-core components, ensuring consistency and high quality across projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll give a short introduction to nf-core and how nf-core/tools supports both pipeline developers and end users, helping the community build reliable and reusable workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Building Open Research Infrastructure: Connecting the Lab Bench to Computational Analysis with RSpace &amp; Galaxy</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern research workflows are often fragmented, requiring scientists to navigate a complex path from the lab bench to computational analysis. The journey typically involves documenting experiments in an electronic lab notebook and then manually transferring data to a separate computational platform for analysis. This process creates inefficiencies, introduces errors, and complicates provenance tracking. To address this challenge, we have developed a tight, two-way integration between two open-source solutions: RSpace, a research data management platform and ELN, and Galaxy, a web-based platform for accessible, reproducible computational analysis. By connecting two open-source platforms, we're building truly open research infrastructure that institutions can adapt to their specific needs while maintaining full control over their research data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration's foundational step makes RSpace a native repository within Galaxy, enabling researchers to browse their RSpace Gallery and import data directly into Galaxy histories. This connection is bidirectional; not only can data be pulled into Galaxy but also selected outputs or even entire histories can be exported back to RSpace. This creates a seamless FAIR data flow that preserves the critical link between experimental results and their computational context.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on this foundation, the integration has been further extended to allow researchers to initiate analysis directly from RSpace. By selecting data attached to a document and clicking a Galaxy icon, users upload it into a fresh, systematically-annotated Galaxy history that traces the data to its experimental source. This allows to document field work, launch a complex analysis, monitor its progress, and import the results, all while maintaining a clear and auditable link between the initial data and documentation and the outputs of the final computational analysis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partnership between two open-source platforms represents a significant stride towards more open, integrated, cohesive research infrastructure that institutions can build upon, reducing friction so scientists can focus on discovery rather than data logistics. Future developments will focus on improving the native repository integration, automated reporting of results back to RSpace, enhanced RO-Crate support for standardized metadata exchange, and improved templating in RSpace for sharing and reusing specific workflow configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I will share how adopting &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/"&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt; transformed my bioinformatics practice, turning fragile, environment‑dependent pipelines into reliable, reproducible workflows.  I will walk the audience through the practical challenges of traditional Docker‑centric setups, introduce the core concepts of Nix and its package collection (nixpkgs), and explain  how tools such as &lt;a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/"&gt;rix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rixpress/"&gt;rixpress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/PapenfussLab/bionix"&gt;bionix&lt;/a&gt; simplify data analysis workflows. Attendees will leave with concrete strategies for managing development environments, rapid prototyping, and generating Docker images directly from Nix expressions—complete with tips, tricks, and curated resources to lower the barrier to adoption. Whether you’re unfamiliar with Nix or have found it intimidating, this session aims to inspire a shift toward reproducible, maintainable bioinformatics pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Nf-core proteinfold: a community-driven open source pipeline for deep learning based protein structure prediction methods</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The release of AlphaFold2 paved the way for a new generation of prediction tools for studying unknown proteomes. These tools enable highly accurate protein structure predictions by leveraging advances in deep learning. However, their implementation can pose technical challenges for users, who must navigate a complex landscape of dependencies and large reference databases. Providing the community with a standardized workflow framework to run these tools could ease adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its adherence to nf-core guidelines, the nf-core/proteinfold pipeline simplifies the application of state-of-the-art protein structure modeling techniques by taking advantage of the optimized execution Nextflow’s capabilities on both cloud providers and HPC infrastructures. The pipeline integrates several popular methods, namely AlphaFold 2 and 3, Boltz 1 and 2, ColabFold, ESMFold, HelixFold, RosettaFoldAA, and RosettaFold2NA. Following structure prediction, nf-core/proteinfold generates an interactive report that allows users to explore and compare predicted models together with standardized confidence metrics, harmonized across methods for consistent interpretation. The workflow also integrates Foldseek-based structural search, enabling the identification of known protein structures similar to the predicted models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline is developed through an international collaboration that includes Australian BioCommons, the Centre for Genomic Regulation, Pompeu Fabra University, and the European Bioinformatics Institute, and it already serves as a central resource for structure prediction at several of these organisations and others. This broad adoption demonstrates how nf-core/proteinfold, through its open-source and community-driven development model, is lowering the barrier to using deep learning based approaches for protein structure prediction in everyday research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, nf core proteinfold represents a new generation of Nextflow workflows designed to place multiple alternative methods for the same task within one coherent framework. This design makes it possible to compare the different procedures, providing a basis for developing combined approaches that may mature into meta-methods.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ProtVista: Open-Source Protein Feature Visualisation with reusable Web Components</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProtVista&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source protein feature visualisation tool used by UniProt, the high-quality, comprehensive, and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information. It is built upon the suite of modular &lt;strong&gt;standard and reusable web components&lt;/strong&gt; called Nightingale, a &lt;strong&gt;collaborative open-source&lt;/strong&gt; library. It enables integration of protein sequence features, variants, and structural data in a unified viewer. These components are shared across resources, for example Nightingale components also power feature visualisations in InterPro or PDBe, and the turnkey ProtVista library is used by Open Targets or Pharos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtVista is undergoing major &lt;strong&gt;technical upgrades&lt;/strong&gt;, to expand its reach, cover broader use cases, and also be able to handle ever-growing quantities of data. We are transitioning &lt;strong&gt;from SVG graphics to Canvas/WebGL rendering&lt;/strong&gt; to improve performance for large datasets and on low-spec devices. We are refactoring the tool’s core to allow &lt;strong&gt;custom data inputs&lt;/strong&gt; via a configurable API, letting developers plug in their own protein annotation data sources. Additionally, a new track configuration UI will let end-users &lt;strong&gt;toggle and rearrange feature tracks&lt;/strong&gt; for a more flexible, tailored view. This talk will introduce ProtVista’s open-source design based on &lt;strong&gt;standards&lt;/strong&gt; and demonstrate how these upcoming enhancements make it easier and faster to build &lt;strong&gt;interactive protein feature visualisations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>InterProScan 6: a modern large-scale protein function annotation pipeline</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="bioinformatics">Bioinformatics &amp; Computational Biology</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The rate of sequencing novel biological constructs far outpaces the capacity for accurate laboratory-based functional annotation. Computational methods help prioritise research and manage resources, yet protein function prediction remains a core challenge in bioinformatics. InterProScan is a widely adopted tool for functional annotation, scanning protein sequences against predictive models, including HMMs and BLAST PSSMs, and mapping results to InterPro entries. This facilitates assignment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathways, and other curated data. InterProScan is integral to genome annotation pipelines like UniProt, Ensembl, and MGnify Genomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterProScan 5 introduced a Java-based architecture capable of coordinating multiple analyses across compute environments. However, its monolithic design and tight coupling to specific data releases created challenges: users had to download large bundles and manage dependencies manually, complicating installation and reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these issues, we present InterProScan 6, a complete reimplementation using the Nextflow workflow management system. Designed for flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility, it incorporates modular data handling, modern container technologies, and improved integration mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterProScan 6 is a modular Nextflow pipeline, enabling parallelisation and scalability across environments ranging from local systems to HPC (e.g. Slurm, LSF) and cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud). Users need only install Nextflow and a container engine (e.g. Docker, Singularity); all other dependencies are bundled in containers and automatically retrieved by the workflow, ensuring consistent environments and simplifying setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterProScan 6 supports predictive tools from InterPro member databases (e.g. CDD, Pfam) and others like AntiFam, Coils, and MobiDB-lite. It also integrates advanced deep learning predictors: TMHMM is replaced by TMbed for transmembrane helix prediction, and SignalP 4.1 by SignalP 6.0. The architecture allows easy integration of new methods without altering the core pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major improvement is the decoupling of code and data. Unlike prior versions, software and data are no longer distributed as a single package. Users can specify the InterPro data version at runtime (via ‘--interpro &lt;version&gt;’), enabling reproducibility and cross-version comparisons without reinstallation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower the storage burden and improve usability, InterProScan 6 introduces on-demand data retrieval. By invoking the pipeline with the ‘--applications’ and ‘--interpro’ parameters, the workflow automatically fetches only the necessary signature data required for the selected analyses and InterPro version. This significantly reduces disk usage and simplifies setup for users only interested in a subset of available tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containerisation is central to InterProScan 6’s design. Every pipeline step is executed within a defined container image, bundling all required software and system libraries. Profiles for Docker, Singularity, and Apptainer are included, allowing users to run the pipeline consistently across different environments. This approach removes the need for manual dependency management, simplifies troubleshooting, and greatly enhances reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterProScan 5 uses the Match Lookup Service, a web service that provides precomputed matches for known sequences. When sequences are scanned with InterProScan, their MD5 checksums are submitted to this service, which returns existing annotations for recognised sequences, allowing InterProScan to bypass redundant local computation and improve performance. However, the original Match Lookup Service was purpose-built for InterProScan 5 and not designed for broader accessibility, representing a missed opportunity to share over 14 billion matches derived from 1 billion sequences with the wider research community. To address this, the Match Lookup Service has been reimplemented as the Matches API (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/matches/api), a modern, developer-friendly, RESTful web service. The Matches API supports programmatic submission of up to 100 sequence checksums per request and returns results in JSON format consistent with InterProScan 6 output. Unlike the original service, the API also returns associated InterPro entries for matches linked to integrated signatures, as well as residue-level annotations for CDD, SFLD, and PIRSR. Furthermore, support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows client-side web applications to directly access the API, greatly facilitating integration of InterPro annotations into external tools and analysis pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterProScan 6 is available under the Apache 2.0 open source license, and distributed via GitHub (https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan6/), with containers hosted on DockerHub. Extensive documentation and example configurations are provided to help users deploy and customise the pipeline for diverse annotation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis have made reading and writing genetic code faster and cheaper than ever. Yet most labs run experiments at the same scale they did a decade ago, not because the biology is limiting, but because the software hasn't caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional digital representation of a genome is a string of nucleotides. This works well enough for simple projects, but the model breaks down as complexity grows. Sequences aren't constant: they evolve, mutate, and are iterated on. Unlike software, there's no instant feedback loop to tell you if an edit worked; wetlab experiments take time. You gain some of that time back by working with multiple sequences in parallel. But keeping track of thousands of sequences and coordinate frames is tricky at best when a researcher is working solo, and far harder when collaborating with other people or agents on the same genetic codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen is a version control system built specifically for biological sequences (http://github.com/genhub-bio/gen). It models genomic data as a graph rather than flat text, preserving the full structure of variation, editing history, and experimental lineage. On top of this, projects are organized into repositories with branching, diffing, and merging, just like git. Git was first released 20 years ago and transformed how software teams collaborate on shared codebases. Gen brings that same workflow to biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce Gen's design philosophy and walk through a real-world use case. Gen is open source under the Apache 2.0 license, implemented in Rust with a terminal interface and Python bindings, and designed to integrate with existing bioinformatics pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;dingo is a Python package that brings advanced scientific-computing techniques into the hands of developers and researchers. It focuses on modelling metabolic networks — complex systems describing how cells process nutrients and energy — by simulating the full range of possible biochemical flux states. Historically, exploring these possibilities in large-scale networks has been computationally prohibitive. dingo introduces state-of-the-art Monte Carlo sampling algorithms that dramatically speed up these simulations, enabling the analysis of very large models such as Recon3D on a regular personal computer in under a day. With its easy-to-use Python interface and integration within the broader scientific Python ecosystem (e.g. NumPy, Matplotlib), dingo lowers the barrier to entry for studying complex biological systems. This talk will walk the audience through the computational challenges of metabolic modelling, show how dingo leverages Python and efficient sampling to overcome them, and highlight how Python developers and computational biologists alike can contribute to or extend this open-source project. Whether you’re interested in open-source scientific software, computational biology, or high-performance Monte Carlo methods in Python, this talk aims to inspire and provide actionable insight into using and contributing to dingo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AI is gaining importance in bioinformatics with new methods and tools popping every day. While applications of AI in bioinformatics inherited a lot of technological solutions from other AI-driven fields, such as image recognition or natural language processing, this particular domain has its own challenges. An alarming example is a study showing that most AI models for detecting COVID from radiographs do not rely on medically relevant pathological signals, but rather in shortcuts such as text tokens on the images (DeGrave et al., Nat Mach Intell, 2021, doi: 10.1038/s42256-021-00338-7), stressing the importance of the data, on which the AI models were trained. Equally special is the data used for training biological language models: first, it is not that large compared to natural languages (e.g. one of the most successful protein language models ESM-2 has been trained on only 250M sequences), and second, it is highly structured by evolution and natural selection, and thus has a relatively low intrinsic dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I will speak about consequences of this underlying structure of the data for performance of models that are trained with it -- spoiler alert! it is terribly overestimated. The reason for this is information or data leakage: the model remembers irrelevant features highly correlated with the target variable and does not learn any biologically meaningful properties that can be transferred to out-of-distribution data. I will present our own check list (see our paper Bernett et al., Nat Methods, 2024, doi: 10.1038/s41592-024-02362-y) and a solution (https://github.com/kalininalab/DataSAIL, Joeres et al., Nat Comm, 2025, doi: 10.1038/s41467-025-58606-8) for avoiding the information leakage pitfall. I will discuss examples and applications from protein function prediction and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The study of animal behaviour has been transformed by the increasing use of machine learning-based tools, such as DeepLabCut and SLEAP, which can track the positions of animals and their body parts from video footage. However, there is currently no user-friendly, general-purpose solution for processing and analysing the motion tracks generated by these tools. To address this gap, we are developing movement, an open-source Python package that provides a unified interface for analysing motion tracking data from multiple formats. Initially, movement prioritised implementing methods for data cleaning and kinematic analysis. We are now focusing on expanding its data visualization capabilities and on developing metrics to analyze how animals interact with each other and with their environment. Future plans include adding modules for specialised applications such as pupillometry and collective behaviour, as well as supporting integration with neurophysiological data analysis tools. Importantly, movement is designed to cater to researchers with varying levels of coding expertise and computational resources, featuring an intuitive graphical user interface. Furthermore, the project is committed to transparency, with dedicated engineers collaborating with a global community of contributors to ensure its long-term sustainability. We invite feedback from the community to help shape movement's future as a comprehensive toolbox for analysing animal behaviour.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical-level simulation of neurons brings together many different challenges in the realms of biophysical modelling, numerical analysis, HPC, neuromorphic hardware and software design. To approach these challenges, we recently developed a modular platform, EDEN (https://eden-simulator.org). EDEN offers both a &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;able simulation package for neuroscientists, and a modular &lt;em&gt;construction kit&lt;/em&gt; for neuro-simulator programmers to rapidly develop and evaluate new computational methods. It leverages the community standard NeuroML (https://neuroml.org) to integrate with the existing open-source stack of modelling and analysis tools, and minimise the barrier to entry for technical innovations in neural simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly gave the Debian Med project a strong boost. New contributors joined, collaboration intensified, and Debian’s role in supporting biomedical research and infrastructure became more visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost five years later, Debian Med continues to benefit from this momentum. The project still shows higher activity levels than before the pandemic, with lasting improvements in package quality, continuous integration coverage, and cooperation with other Debian teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present how the Debian Med team has evolved since the pandemic, which effects have lasted, and where new challenges have emerged as both the world — and Debian — have settled into a new normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about Debian Med at https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tabular data, often scattered across multiple tables, is the primary output of data analyses in virtually all scientific fields. Exchange and communication of tabular data is therefore a central challenge. With Datavzrd, we present a tool for creating portable, visually rich, interactive reports from tabular data in any kind of scientific discipline. Datavzrd unifies the strengths of currently common generic approaches for interactive visualization like R Shiny with the portability, ease of use and sustainability of plain spreadsheets. The generated reports do not require the maintenance of a web server nor the installation of specialized software for viewing and can simply be attached to emails, shared via cloud services, or serve as manuscript supplements. They can be specified without requiring imperative programming, thereby enabling rapid development and offering accessibility for non-computational scientists, unlocking the look and feel of dedicated manually crafted web applications without the maintenance and development burden. Datavzrd reports scale from small tables to thousands or millions of rows and offer the ability to link multiple related tables, allowing to jump between corresponding rows or hierarchically explore growing levels of detail. We will demonstrate Datavzrd on real-world bioinformatics examples from tools such as Orthanq and Varlociraptor, highlighting how it can turn complex analytical outputs into interactive, shareable reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guixifying workflow management system: past, present, maybe future?&lt;/strong&gt;
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology face a twofold challenge.  On one hand, the number of steps required to process the amounts of data is becoming larger and larger.  And each step implies software involving more and more dependencies.  On the other hand, Reproducible Research requires the ability to deeply verify and scrutinize all the processes. And Open Science asks about the ability to reuse, modify or extend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflow might be transparent and reproducible if and only if it’s built on the top of package managers that allow, with the passing of time, to finely control both the set of dependencies and the ability to scrutinize or adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first story is &lt;a href="https://hpc.guix.info/"&gt;Guix&lt;/a&gt; Workflow Language (&lt;a href="https://guixwl.org/"&gt;GWL&lt;/a&gt;): a promise that has not reached its potential.  The second story is Concise Common Workflow Language (&lt;a href="https://ccwl.systemreboot.net/"&gt;CCWL&lt;/a&gt;): compiling Guile/Scheme workflow descriptions to CWL inputs.  The third story is &lt;a href="https://forge.systemreboot.net/ravanan/"&gt;Ravanan&lt;/a&gt;: a CWL implementation powered by &lt;a href="https://hpc.guix.info/"&gt;Guix&lt;/a&gt; – a transparent and reproducible package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a threefold short story that makes one: long-term, transparent and reproducible workflow needs first package managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VTX, High Performance Visualization of Molecular Structure and Trajectories&lt;/strong&gt;
VTX is a molecular visualization software capable to handle most molecular structures and dynamics trajectories file formats. It features a real-time high-performance molecular graphics engine, based on modern OpenGL, optimized for the visualization of massive molecular systems and molecular dynamics trajectories. VTX includes multiple interactive camera and user interaction features, notably free-fly navigation and a fully modular graphical user interface designed for increased usability. It allows the production of high-resolution images for presentations and posters with custom background. VTX design is focused on performance and usability for research, teaching, and educative purposes.

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multimodal Tumor Evolution Analysis: Interactive 4D CT and Time-Aligned Clinical Data in a Hospital Web Platform&lt;/strong&gt;
Modern oncology practice relies on understanding how tumors evolve across multiple imaging studies and how these changes correlate with clinical events. This talk presents a hospital-oriented web platform for multimodal tumor evolution analysis, integrating interactive 4D CT visualization with time-aligned clinical data, including PDF clinical documents, lab results and treatment milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system combines a Node.js front end with a Flask-based visualization backend that handles CT preprocessing, metadata extraction, and generation of time-synchronized 4D volumes. Clinicians can navigate volumetric CT scans across multiple time points, compare tumor morphology longitudinally, and immediately access the corresponding clinical context within the same interface. The platform displays radiology reports, pathology documents, and other PDF-based data side-by-side with imaging, creating a unified temporal view of patient evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the architecture, including the ingestion pipeline for DICOM and document data, the design of the multimodal synchronization layer, rendering strategies for large 4D CT volumes, and the integration of document viewers and time-series dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA storage and open-source projects&lt;/strong&gt;
The magnetic recording field goes back to the pioneering work of Oberlin Smith, who conceptualized a magnetic recording apparatus in 1878. Fast forward, in 1947, engineers invented the first high-speed, cathode ray tube based fully electronic memory. In 1950, engineers developed magnetic drum memory. In 1951, the first tape storage device was invented. By 1953, engineers had developed magnetic core memory. The first hard disk drive RAMAC was developed in 1957. Since then, HDDs have dominated the storage for several decades and continue to do so because of its low cost-per-gigabyte and low bit-error-rate. Based on some estimates, in 2023, approximately 330 million terabytes of data were created each day. By 2024, HDDs dominated over half of the world’s data storage. As of 2025, approximately 0.4 zettabytes of new data are being generated each day, which equals about 402.74 million terabytes. What does it indicate? Data is growing and there is a need of solutions in term of longevity, low power consumption, and high capacity. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based storage is being considered as one of the solutions. This talk is about current status of DNA storage and open-source projects that exist in this domain so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Binary to Granular: Automating Multi-Threshold Survival Analysis with OptSurvCutR&lt;/strong&gt;
In risk modelling, categorising continuous variables—such as biomarker levels or credit scores—is essential for creating distinct risk groups. While existing tools can optimize a single threshold (creating "High" vs "Low" groups), they lack a systematic framework for identifying multiple cut-points. This limitation forces analysts to rely on simple binary splits, which often mask the actual shape of the data. This approach fails to detect complex biological realities, such as U-shaped risk profiles or multi-step risk stratification involving 3, 4, or even 5+ distinct groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk, I will introduce OptSurvCutR, an R package designed to bridge this gap using a reproducible workflow. Currently under peer review at rOpenSci, the package automates the search for optimal thresholds in time-to-event data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will demonstrate how the package:
- &lt;strong&gt;Goes Beyond Binary Splits&lt;/strong&gt;: Unlike standard tools restricted to a single cut-off, &lt;em&gt;OptSurvCutR&lt;/em&gt; uses systematic searches to identify multiple thresholds, automatically defining granular risk strata (e.g., Low, Moderate, High, Severe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevents False Positives&lt;/strong&gt;: It integrates statistical corrections (MSRS) to ensure that the differences between these multiple curves are real, not just random chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantifies Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;: It uses bootstrap validation to measure the stability of the thresholds, ensuring that your multi-level risk model is robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping to Mend the Disconnect Between Biological Research and Medicine: A tale of two -- different -- kinds of graphs&lt;/strong&gt;
As our tools evolve from scripts and pipelines to intelligent, context-aware systems, the interfaces we use to interact with data are being reimagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how accelerated and integrated compute is reshaping the landscape of biobank-scale datasets, weaving together genomics, imaging, and phenotypic data with and feeding validatable models.  Expect a whirlwind tour through:
·              Ultra-fast sequence alignment and real-time discretization
·              Estimating cis/trans effects on variant penetrance via haploblock architecture
·              Biobank scale data federation
·              Knowledge graphs as dynamic memory systems (GNNs - LLM co-embedding)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll close by tackling the unglamorous but essential bits: validation, contextualization, and the digital hygiene required to keep model-generated data from becoming biomedical junk DNA. Think of it as a roadmap toward smarter, faster, and more trustworthy data-driven healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PyQGIS. A not so well guarded secret in the most popular open-source geospatial system. You struggle doing a thing, and then open this one panel... And turns out, every single thing that you can click on, is available for programmatic calls. Load data, style it and process, prepare layouts for exporting, add panels and interactive modes, even add games using the GIS user interface. Everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geospatial is hard. Software is hard. Making a new software for a one-time or an obscure process would be prohibitively complex. So no wonder many people turn towards QGIS for its extensive plugin capabilities. But what if we need to make something for the mobile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about Every Door plugins. Every Door is an OpenStreetMap editor for going outside and collecting data. It's been custom designed for the OSM schema. But turns out, we've got thousands other services and processes on top of OSM, and many people would like "just one more button" or a panel. Let's see what has changed in Every Door over the winter that enables you to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>State of the MapLibre Tile Format</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The MapLibre community is currently in the midst of developing the MapLibre Tile Format, a modern, open, and fully community-governed successor to the ubiquitous Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format. While MVT has served the mapping ecosystem well for over a decade, it also carries historical constraints that limit interoperability, formal specification quality, extensibility, and independence from proprietary platforms. As MapLibre continues to grow as the central open-source foundation for web-based map rendering, it has become increasingly clear that a future-proof, openly specified, and collaboratively designed tile format is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will offer a look into why we initiated this engineering effort and what gaps the new format aims to close. I will explain the core design principles behind the specification—clarity, strictness where needed, optionality where useful, and full transparency throughout the process. Attendees will gain a technical understanding of how the format works, including its data model, feature encoding strategy, metadata approach, and compatibility considerations for existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the current specification draft, I will outline the major areas still under active development. These include discussions about schema evolution, advanced geometry representations, compression strategies, and interoperability with raster, elevation, 3D  and non-geographic datasets. I will also provide insight into the collaborative workflow between maintainers, researchers, vendors, and the wider open-source community, highlighting where contributions and feedback are particularly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the talk will cover how the rollout is progressing in practice. This includes early tooling support, reference implementations, testing frameworks, and real-world trials by organizations exploring migration paths away from MVT. The session will present an honest, up-to-date snapshot of the project’s status and a forward-looking roadmap for the next stages of development, helping the community understand both what is ready today and what is still on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Boost.Geometry is a C++ library defining concepts, primitives and algorithms for solving geometry problems. It contains a dimension-agnostic, coordinate-system-agnostic and scalable kernel, on top of which algorithms are built: area, distance, convex hull, intersection, within, simplify, transform etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library contains instantiable geometry classes, but library users can also use their own legacy geometry types. It also contains spatial index allowing to perform spatial and knn queries on a collection of geometries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will introduce Boost.Geometry focusing on mapping and GIS. Boost.Geometry is the engine behind MySQL’s spatial query capabilities. The presentation will highlight recent developments in the library and conclude with a roadmap of the future work in Boost.Geometry.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; community often seek for tooling to organize topic-focused contribution projects and monitoring is crucial to set appropriate encouragement in the areas were it's most needed.
Dealing with significant amount of daily change files or oversized historical data can be challenging if you want to focus on a given topic among the whole OSM changelog like the needle in the haystack.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/osm-fr/podoma"&gt;Podoma&lt;/a&gt; is a free software intended to do this hard work for you, guiding you through the change log and counting as quick as no one. It provides web interface, useful API and KPI to be at ease with monitoring specific topics worldwide or around your house in OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce Podoma, its basic functionalities and showcase the build of a monitoring project live from the raw OpenStreetMap data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a FOSS stack for building, rendering, and using OpenStreetMap vector tiles.  Ascend Maps ( https://github.com/styluslabs/maps ) is a cross-platform application for interactive maps. It is extremely customizable, with hiking, cycling, and transit views for the base map, user-editable sources, styles, and shaders for custom maps and overlays, and plugins for search, routing, and map sources.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tangram-ng ( https://github.com/styluslabs/tangram-ng ) extends the Tangram ES map engine originally created by Mapzen, adding support for 3D terrain, embedded SVG, and additional raster formats, along with substantial performance and stability improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;geodesk-tiles ( https://github.com/styluslabs/geodesk-tiles ) builds vector tiles on demand from a GeoDesk library, making it possible to start serving tiles for the whole world instantly.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Writing scripts that involve spatial data often gets messy fast, because of the number of formats, plethora of tools, and volume of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter and similar notebook environments help with some of these problems, but can tend to favor one language at a time, and require a GUI or other environment for execution rather than a single "script".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we introduce a new experimental console-based tool -- samaki -- which provides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a simple text format for combining source code and tools from multiple languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a flow for iteratively generating files in many data formats that are interdependent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a mechanism for adding bespoke visualization and other tooling during the coding lifecycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we look at examples of using this fast flow for doing things like pulling from OpenStreetMap, manipulating geoJSON, analyzing with DuckDB,  leveraging PostGIS and using LLMs judiciously.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Spoiler Alert ⚠️ One day, you are going to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not get a blue plaque on the side of a building, or a statue, or even a Wikipedia entry.
But perhaps you’ll get a memorial bench?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built https://openbenches.org where anyone can add to a collection of open data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll show you why &amp;amp; how we built this collection of &amp;gt;39,000 memorial benches from around the world, how it integrates with OSM, and what we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It started as a simple idea — teaching colleagues how to use OpenStreetMap. A few sessions later, more than a hundred people had learned not just how to map, but why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk follows two parallel stories: the trainees who discovered new tools, confidence, and purpose through digital mapping, and the company that found a new way to connect its volunteer days with growth and community impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they show how learning to map the world can also reshape how we see our own roles, our teams, and our shared capacity to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Geospatial analysis and GIS workflows are traditionally tied to heavy desktop applications, steep learning curves, and complex toolchains. JupyterGIS transforms this paradigm by enabling fully interactive, browser-based GIS workflows inside JupyterLab. Researchers, educators, and developers can now visualize, analyze, and edit spatial data collaboratively, leveraging modern web technologies while retaining the power of native geospatial engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents how the Project Jupyter, WebAssembly, and GDAL communities collaborated to build a complete, interactive GIS environment for both desktop and browser platforms. JupyterGIS integrates OpenLayers, GDAL compiled to WebAssembly, and Python or non-Python kernels to deliver:
- Real-time collaborative editing of GIS datasets, including QGIS formats
- Fully client-side geospatial analysis pipelines with raster and vector support
- Customizable symbology and interactive visualizations, including graduated, categorized, and multi-band styling
- Notebook integration for embedding, documenting, and sharing workflows
- Support for cloud-based and local spatial datasets, as well as STAC asset catalogs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical Highlights:
- WebAssembly (WASM): GDAL compiled to WASM enables high-performance spatial operations directly in the browser, without server dependencies.
- Collaborative Editing: Built on Jupyter’s collaborative document model (PyCRDT &amp;amp; Y.js), multiple users can edit layers simultaneously with conflict-free synchronization.
- Extensible Architecture: Modular command system allows custom tools, plugins, and integration with Python or other kernels.
- Integration with Modern Stacks: Seamless support for xarray, Pangeo ecosystem, and upcoming features like story maps and R kernel integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demos &amp;amp; Use Cases:
- Interactive vector and raster layer editing with live symbology updates
- Performing geospatial analysis entirely in-browser using GDAL WASM pipelines
- Collaborative multi-user editing sessions with conflict-free layer management
- Story maps and visualization dashboards for environmental, policy, and STEM applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target Audience:
Researchers, educators, geospatial developers, students, and open source enthusiasts interested in GIS, WebAssembly, or interactive computing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Build Reusable EO Workflows using openEO in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In an era of unprecedented availability of Earth Observation (EO) data, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE)(https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) plays a key role in bridging the gap between data accessibility and actionable insights. Despite the availability of freely accessible satellite data, the widespread adoption of EO applications remains limited due to challenges in extracting meaningful information. Many EO-based projects struggle with non-repeatable, non-reusable workflows, mainly due to the lack of standardized, scalable solutions. 
CDSE tackles these barriers by adopting common standards and patterns, most notably through openEO(https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/openeo). This open-source solution is a community-driven standard that simplifies access to, processing, and analysis of remote sensing data by offering a unified platform. It empowers developers, researchers, and data scientists to use cloud-based resources and distributed computing environments to tackle complex geospatial challenges. Adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), it supports the global sharing and reuse of algorithms, enhancing collaboration and scalability. &lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, by promoting the development of reusable, scalable, and shareable workflows, openEO enhances the efficiency and reproducibility of the EO workflow. Its feature-rich capabilities have also been used and validated in large-scale operational projects such as ESA WorldCereal and the JRC Copernicus Global Land Cover and Tropical Forestry Mapping and Monitoring Service (LCFM), which relies on its robust and reliable infrastructure. 
Through this session, we aim to present users with openEO and its capabilities. We will highlight how users can seamlessly convert algorithms into a process graph, thereby creating reusable services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Frontline health managers are on the sharp end of climate change, yet rarely have practical ways to use local climate signals in routine planning. Climate × Health Pulse (Climate Pulse, pulse.datakind.org) is an early-stage open prototype that fuses localized climate and health datasets into sub-county geospatial views and decision cues for county health teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk and demo we’ll show an end-to-end, FOSS-first workflow: ingesting heterogeneous climate (e.g., temperature, rainfall, drought indices) and health indicators (facility reports, disease surveillance, vulnerability proxies), harmonizing them with open standards, and publishing actionable map layers for operational use. The initial pilot focuses on Kajiado County, Kenya, where heat stress, water scarcity, and shifting vector-borne disease risk create urgent planning needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll highlight what works, what’s hard, and what’s next: data interoperability, scalable analytics, offline-friendly UX for low-bandwidth contexts, and governance for sustainable local ownership. We’re actively seeking collaborators to co-develop Climate Pulse—especially on geospatial data layers, standards alignment, and field testing—so that open climate intelligence can meaningfully support health systems under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Caves surveying is a pretty obscure niche in mapping, with its own set of software. There have been great FLOSS tools since the 1980s, and in the last few years cavers realised that they could use 'normal GIS' too, so a slow convergence is underway. This talk will give a brisk tour of the FLOSS tools we use, and also talk about the complicated problem of managing datasets spanning 40, 50 or even 100 years, with changing equipment, formats, personnel and computing kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we'll touch on the future of Lidar and VR for 3D space modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The open-source tool &lt;a href="http://osm2world.org/"&gt;OSM2World&lt;/a&gt; turns OpenStreetMap data into detailed 3D models of the world. This talk presents the current state of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D visuals are increasingly becoming a standard feature of geospatial applications. Whether you want to explore the world in your browser, build games and virtual reality applications, or export content to modelling software as a starting point for creative projects, you need software tools which fully support the third dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSM2World makes it possible to generate 3D content for these kinds of applications from freely available OpenStreetMap data. Usable as a library or stand-alone application, it generates seamless outdoor and indoor representations of buildings, displays road and railway networks, and creates models for a large number of other feature types found in OpenStreetMap data. With support for the glTF standard, physically based rendering (PBR) and 3D tiles displayed in the browser using WebGL, models produced by OSM2World serve a wide range of uses.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk gives a rundown of various potential improvements being thought about and experimented on for the CUBIC Congestion Control implementation in Neqo, Firefox's QUIC stack. Detecting and recovering from Spurious Congestion Events -- network hiccups mistaken as congestion signal. Reacting differently to Explicit Congestion Notifications (ECN) than to packet loss. Optimizing the Slow Start exit point to avoid unnecessary loss through various heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of these make sense on paper and produce good results in simulations the reality of the internet is much more complicated. One ongoing challenge is designing metrics that measure impact of change in the real world without getting lost in the noise of wildly varying network conditions across millions of internet users to validate that those improvements genuinely make Firefox quic(k)er.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;iroh is a library to establish peer-to-peer QUIC connections assisted by relay servers.  It needs to route UDP datagrams carrying QUIC payloads over relayed and holepunched network paths.  While this used to be done outside of QUIC's knowledge, over the past year we have worked to adopt the QUIC multipath proposed standard so that QUIC itself is aware of multiple paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover iroh's experience of adding QUIC multipath to the Quinn library and the challenges of adopting it. The multipath draft does only cover how to send packets over the wire, and does not specify how path selection works, consequently we'll also cover iroh's choices for path selection as well as changes we will still be experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally iroh has also moved holepunching into a QUIC extension, which integrates tightly with multipath. The mechanism of how holepunching with multipath support works in iroh will covered as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Web’s transport stack is changing rapidly, with QUIC, HTTP/3, and encrypted DNS seeing broad adoption. This talk gives an overview of the modern network protocols Firefox already deploys and invests in, including QUIC and HTTP/3’s growing share of Web traffic. It will highlight what Firefox actually sends on the wire today, what benefits we observe in practice, and where the Web’s protocol landscape stands in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session will also offer an outlook on what’s likely to land in Firefox and across the Web in 2026 and beyond. This includes emerging mechanisms like Happy Eyeballs v3 to manage increasingly complex protocol selection, WebTransport as a modern WebSocket primitive, MASQUE-based proxying for new tunneling use cases, and ongoing work around encrypted DNS, resolver discovery, and Encrypted Client Hello. Together these protocols form the foundation of a faster and more private Web.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Harnessing Hardware for High-Performance Traffic Management in FD.io/VPP</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="network">Network</track>
        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;h1&gt;Harnessing Hardware for High-Performance Traffic Management in VPP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic Management (TM)&lt;/strong&gt; is critical for predictable network performance. It controls packet priority, shapes transmission rates, and allocates bandwidth to meet SLAs in large-scale deployments such as ISPs, telecom networks, and data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FD.io Vector Packet Processing (VPP)&lt;/strong&gt;, a widely adopted high-performance networking stack across these environments, currently relies on &lt;strong&gt;software-based TM&lt;/strong&gt;. This introduces bottlenecks at scale: CPU overhead grows with traffic classes, latency spikes under load, and token bucket waste cycles. At 100G/200G and beyond, these limitations pose a critical risk of &lt;strong&gt;SLA violations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new TM framework addresses these challenges by &lt;strong&gt;offloading shaping and scheduling to hardware&lt;/strong&gt; through a &lt;strong&gt;vendor-neutral&lt;/strong&gt; architecture and a &lt;strong&gt;unified API&lt;/strong&gt; that works across all platforms supporting traffic management in silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed TM framework integrates VPP with hardware traffic management engines in supported NICs, SmartNICs, and DPUs. It detects hardware capabilities, classifies flows in software, and steers them to hardware queues where TM policies are enforced at line rate—eliminating software-based per-packet arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical Scheduling:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizes traffic into multi-level queues to prioritize critical services while preserving fairness across remaining traffic. 
&lt;strong&gt;Dual-Rate Shaping:&lt;/strong&gt; Applies committed and peak rate control with burst handling, compliant with RFC 2698, to prevent congestion and maintain predictable performance. 
&lt;strong&gt;Priority and Fairness:&lt;/strong&gt; Combines strict priority for latency-sensitive traffic with weighted sharing for bulk flows to balance resources. 
&lt;strong&gt;Policing:&lt;/strong&gt; Enforces traffic limits at line rate by dropping or marking packets appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advantages of Traffic Management in Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Delivers line-rate Traffic Management with high accuracy and low latency. 
&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports thousands of queues at line rates without proportional CPU costs. 
&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Shifts workload to hardware, enabling CPUs to focus on application logic while reducing energy usage 
&lt;strong&gt;Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures stable Quality of Service under peak load conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware-assisted TM is no longer optional—it is mission-critical for networks scaling toward 400G/800G with diverse traffic and tight latency budgets. The VPP TM framework delivers this through a vendor-neutral API, &lt;strong&gt;making VPP ready for demanding telecom and data center workloads&lt;/strong&gt; while preserving its modular design. For open-source stacks like VPP, this is not just an enhancement—it’s a long-overdue capability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Beyond MCP Servers: Why Network Automation Agents Need Knowledge Graphs</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone's building MCP servers for network automation. Your agents can finally talk to each other and share context about your infrastructure. But what context are they actually sharing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your agent's understanding of the network comes from vector embeddings and RAG, MCP is just helping you share incomplete topology understanding and missed policy dependencies faster. Vector similarity can't represent "which devices are upstream of this link" or "what routing policies affect this prefix."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCP makes context sharing easy. Knowledge graphs make that context actually correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss lessons learned as a developer advocate maintaining coffeeAGNTCY, an open-source multi-agent system. Mainly, sharing the discovery of why knowledge graphs with LangGraph are essential for network automation agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-What MCP servers can't fix (the context representation problem)
-Knowledge graphs for network topology, routing, and policy dependencies
-LangGraph for reasoning over graph-structured network data
-Real patterns from coffeeAGNTCY project (lungo)

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Network operations still depend heavily on manual workflows. Engineers move between CLIs, dashboards, and scripts to answer operational questions, validate configurations, and enforce compliance across diverse network platforms. These tasks are repetitive, error-prone, and hard to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a practical AgenticOps architecture for network operations built with open source tools. It shows how low-code visual orchestration can be combined with LLM-based reasoning to automate both interactive and scheduled tasks while preserving native CLI access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system uses n8n for workflow orchestration, Model Context Protocol servers written in Python with FastMCP to expose network capabilities, and Cisco pyATS to execute platform-aware CLI commands across multiple device families. Operators interact through a chat interface using natural language. The LLM classifies intent, discovers device type, selects the correct commands, executes them via pyATS, and returns structured results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same workflows also handle automated compliance checks, report generation, and scheduled validations. The session includes a live demonstration and a GitHub repository with MCP servers, n8n workflows, and deployment examples ready to adapt to real environments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Terabits without Tall Tales: Reproducible Packet &amp; Session Benchmarks in FD.io (CSIT + VPP)</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"For better or worse, benchmarks shape a field." FD.io's approach to the better: open, reproducible benchmarks-as-code that guide development and guard against regressions in the VPP data plane, via CSIT.
Problem: a race-track number doesn't translate to production deployments. CSIT's approach: MLRsearch (IETF BMWG, RFC in publication) for conditional throughput (NDR/PDR) with explicit stopping rules and inspectable artifacts; a continuous open-source benchmarking pipeline spanning packets and sessions; and a test matrix covering IMIX, QUIC/TLS, NAT, IPsec, ACL, SRv6, and NGFW/proxy use cases. This methodology drives terabit-class packet and session performance on commodity x86/Arm - reliably and repeatably.
Takeaways: a replicable recipe (tools, configs, artifacts) for your lab; why benchmarks-as-code beat ad-hoc testing; and concrete contribution paths across CSIT and VPP (tests, profiles, analysers, data visualisation).&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As enterprises and service providers transition to virtualized and cloud-native infrastructures, the need for scalable, high-performance security becomes critical. &lt;a href="https://fd.io/"&gt;FD.io's Vector Packet Processing (VPP) platform&lt;/a&gt; has emerged as a leading open-source framework for fast packet processing, but how well does it handle modern IPsec workloads in Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we dive deep into the architecture and implementation of IPsec within &lt;a href="https://fd.io/"&gt;FD.io VPP&lt;/a&gt;. We'll explore real-world performance benchmarks, discuss recent improvements, and present best practices for deploying secure, high-throughput IPsec tunnels in containerized and virtualized environments. Attendees will see how VPP's modular pipeline enables flexible integration with orchestration systems, and how it can be tuned for different network function scenarios-from high-density edge sites to large-scale data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're building secure SD-WAN, 5G core, or edge networking solutions, this session will provide actionable insights on leveraging open-source VPP to deliver robust, scalable, and efficient IPsec-powered VNFs and CNFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;
 - How FD.io VPP implements and accelerates IPsec for virtualized and cloud-native deployments
 - Tuning and scaling techniques for maximizing IPsec throughput and minimizing latency
 - Integration patterns for orchestration and real-world deployment considerations
 - Lessons learned from operational use cases and performance testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us to learn how open-source innovation is redefining secure, high-performance networking for the next generation of infrastructure!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>So you want to do RDMA programming? RTRS: An easy to use, reliable high speed transport library over RDMA</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="network">Network</track>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDMA programming is comparatively complex to something like sockets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDMA is the industry standard for data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTRS is a reliable high speed transport library, which provides a simple interface to perform RDMA.
It is a stable, and proven transport library, running on more than 5000 servers across our data centers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTRS establishes a stateful session which provides features like multipath, heartbeats, reusability, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It creates an optimal number of connections based on the number of CPUs, and uses IRQ pinning for data transfers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows users to send and receive data in the form of sg lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTRS is multipath capable (with different policies to choose from) and provides I/O fail-over and load-balancing functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTRS pre-allocates and pre-maps DMA buffers on the server side to speed up data paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefit to the ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An easy to use, reliable and stable RDMA transport library to build any kind of module upon.
RTRS will provide an entry point for newcomers to RDMA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pre mapping abilities have use-cases in high performance use cases like ML and AI training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Russian Censorship Circumvention, Tom’s Traps, and Jerry’s VPN: A 5-Year Journey</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation traces a five-year cat-and-mouse chase between a small VPN provider — more than 150 servers worldwide, millions of users, available on all major platforms — and the Russian state censorship machine. A real-world “Tom and Jerry” scenario where survival hinges on constant adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll walk through the evolving technical and non-technical tactics used by Russian authorities to block VPN access for ordinary users. Every story comes from real, first-hand experience. The methods used five years ago and the methods used today are on entirely different levels; Tom keeps learning new tricks, and Jerry’s struggle to stay alive only gets harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to be useful and insightful for network security engineers, business decision-makers, and human rights activists. Russia is not the only dictatorship experimenting with these techniques — and we expect more dictators to learn from the Russian playbook and adopt similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rethink Firewall is the most downloaded FOSS network security tool on F-Droid for Android devices. For seemingly always-on, always-connected smartphones, on-device firewalls are notoriously hard to implement and maintain. This talk is about how 3 unsuspecting developers frustrated by digital surveillance and internet censorship got together, using the $12k in grant awarded by Mozilla in 2020, to build the missing "network sandbox" for 3B+ Android users, and the financial, technical, systemic challenges they faced along the way: From fighting the networking gods to make IPv6 work across a garden variety of topologies, to pushing the limits of SQLite for real-time stats &amp;amp; capturing network flows, to using Rethink itself to monitor &amp;amp; block its own egress, to testing the frontier of packet manipulation (for Deep Packet Inspection censorship resistance) and IP/domain filtering (supporting over 12 million entries) an Android app can achieve consuming limited resources (battery, processor, and memory), all the while supporting multiple WireGuard upstreams at once through open source virtualization layer (gVisor) Google built for its cloud servers! With a stream of recommendations from GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, DivestOS, the Guardian Project developers, and the varied feature-set Rethink packs, has made it the most downloaded (and probably the most confusing) WireGuard client on F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Aug 2020, we've also been operating Rethink DNS, an anycast, public, censorship-resistant, highly-available DNS resolver serving 40bn requests per month &amp;amp; 400 TB / month in traffic at peak. It has been subject to DDoS attempts &amp;amp; bans by state actors. It is used in the default configuration by some popular anti-censorship projects like VLess, Hiddify, and I2P. The costs for Rethink DNS is paid for by its lead developers and partially by grants from FOSS United, an Indian non-profit. Besides discussing the software optimizations on both the client and server to bring down the costs, an unexpected lending hand from Cloudflare played a major role in handling traffic surges and keeping bad actors in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anti-censorship and anti-surveillance tool for non-rooted Android devices is something we wished existed. We thought we'd be done in a year, but it is year #5 and we've so much left to do, as new users bring in newer feature requests, which mean more bugs and higher costs, too. To give a sense of our strong purpose, the toll of having drawn no salary for 5 years yet feeding our kids, living a frugal lifestyle just so this thing that we're building would exist, is not something our wives take very lightly!&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenPERouter is a lightweight, open-source Provider Edge (PE) router designed to bridge traditional networking with the cloud-native ecosystem. By running directly on Linux hosts and Kubernetes nodes, it terminates VPN protocols and exposes a standard BGP interface, simplifying complex network topologies.
In this session, we will explore the architecture of OpenPERouter and demonstrate how to deploy and interact with host-level Layer 3 protocols and Layer 2 interfaces. We will showcase its seamless integration with the cloud-native ecosystem, specifically enabling L3 EVPN tunneling to common Kubernetes network components like Calico and MetalLB.
Additionally, we will demonstrate how OpenPERouter naturally extends to virtual machine networks by achieving a cross-cluster Layer 2 overlay using EVPN, VXLAN, and KubeVirt. Finally, we will share the project roadmap, highlighting upcoming support for new VPN protocols and standalone deployment methods outside of Kubernetes. Join us to discover how to transform your nodes into advanced network endpoints and simplify fabric connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Scaling GoBGP: Lessons from Building a Dynamic, API‑Driven BGP Control Plane</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has traditionally been associated with hardware routers and static configurations, but modern networks increasingly demand software‑defined, programmable control planes. GoBGP, an open source BGP implementation written in Go, offers a rich API surface that enables dynamic policy changes, on‑the‑fly route injection, and tight integration with automation systems and controllers.
This talk explores the practical challenges and solutions involved in turning GoBGP into a multi‑tenant, production‑grade BGP control plane. We will start with a brief overview of GoBGP's architecture and its gRPC/HTTP APIs, then dive into how those APIs can be leveraged to build a flexible control plane that reacts in real time to external events (for example, service discovery, telemetry feedback, or orchestration workflows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the session focuses on multi‑tenancy and operational aspects:
- Building logical separation between tenants while sharing the same GoBGP control plane.
- Mapping tenants to their own BGP server, route policies, and address families, and keeping configuration manageable as the number of tenants grows.
- Handling dynamic tenant lifecycle events (creation, updates, deletion) through the API without disrupting existing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>STUNMESH-go: Building P2P WireGuard Mesh Without Self-Hosted Infrastructure</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building site-to-site VPNs over LTE/5G or behind NAT and stateful firewalls has always been painful. You either need a central relay server with a public IP, or spend hours configuring port forwarding and STUN. STUNMESH-go takes a different approach. It helps WireGuard peers find each other and establish direct P2P connections without running your own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key idea is simple. Reuse existing public services instead of running your own. STUNMESH-go uses STUN servers to discover NAT endpoints, encrypts peer information with Curve25519, and stores it using flexible plugins, whether that's Cloudflare DNS, a shell script, or any custom key-value storage backend. Peers fetch each other's information and WireGuard handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will cover:
- Cross-platform packet capture (Linux raw sockets vs BSD BPF)
- The plugin system and bringing your own storage without running servers
- Compatibility with WireGuard kernel module (no wireguard-go embedding needed)
- Minimizing binary size for embedded systems
- Real deployments (SD-WAN over LTE and site-to-site VPN mesh)
- Future IPv6 support for stateful firewall traversal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares experience from building P2P networking that works across Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and embedded routers like VyOS, EdgeOS, and OpenWrt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Threads (IoTh) is an experimental networking model that assigns full IPv6 identities—addresses, routing behavior, and protocol stacks—to processes or even individual threads. Instead of containers or VMs, IoTh leverages user-space TCP/IP stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the open IoTh toolchain and its networking architecture:
* libioth: the core IoTh library: a pluggable TCP/IP stack framework for user-space nodes.
* nlinline: A quick and clean API for NetLink networking configuring (implemented in a header file).
* libnlq: Netlink configuration library (for netlink clients and servers).
* iothconf – Simple and expressive configuration for IoTh stacks. Common network setups can be defined with a single character string.
* iothdns + iothnamed: DNS services supporting hash-based addressing and OTIP (One-Time IP) models
* namedhcp: a DNS-driven DHCPv6/4 server for stateful, reproducible address assignment
* otip-utils: tooling for ephemeral, privacy-oriented IPv6 addressing
* iothradvd: an embeddable RA daemon for user-space IPv6 configuration&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deploying a Private 5G network has traditionally been the domain of proprietary vendors with complex, closed hardware. However, the maturity of open-source projects now allows engineers to build fully functional networks using standard servers and open software. Using purely open-source components requires precise orchestration of the hardware and software stack. This session aims to demonstrate a complete, end-to-end O-RAN deployment blueprint on top of OpenNebula. We will explain how to orchestrate the srsRAN suite (providing the centralized and distributed units) and Open5GS (the 5G Core). We will dive into the specific infrastructure requirements for running latency-sensitive telco workloads, focusing on Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA) features. Attendees will learn how to configure SR-IOV and Passthrough for optimized network throughput, implement CPU Pinning and NUMA awareness for performance isolation, and manage Precision Time Protocol (PTP) synchronization from the host to the guest VM. The session will include a walkthrough of the automation blueprints used to configure 5G-ready edge nodes and instantiate verified telco appliances from the OpenNebula Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lightweight tunneling (LWT) has been supported on linux kernel since almost 10 years ago. It enables virtual environments to scale up their tunneling infrastructure, especially when containers are involved and container-to-container communication is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nftables now allows to scale up with tunnel expression, combining it with the infrastructure existing ruleset and other powerful features like maps, sets and stateful objects. During this talk, we will get a good understanding of what is the lightweight tunneling, when it can be useful and how to use it together with Nftables.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dn42.eu"&gt;dn42 (decentralized network 42)&lt;/a&gt; is a community-driven overlay network over the Internet,
it provides a testbed aimed at experimenting with Internet protocols such as BGP, IPv4 and v6, DNS,
that can be used to skill-up, develop new ideas, or interconnect your local hackerspace(s) in a proper network without NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as a real-world lab where you can break things without taking down the Internet,
with over a thousand routes, traffic exchanged, real-life links and latencies and actual peers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick introduction to dn42&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I've set up &lt;a href="https://hcartiaux.github.io/dn42/"&gt;my network (&lt;code&gt;AS4242420263&lt;/code&gt;, aka "Flip Flap Network")&lt;/a&gt;,
  in different geographic zones using Ansible, Debian, WireGuard and Bird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hcartiaux/dn42-sshd-autopeer"&gt;my automatic peering service, dn42-sshd-autopeer&lt;/a&gt;, essentially a custom CLI over SSH,
  allowing other fellow network enthusiasts to request and set up a BGP peering session within a few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed in Python under MIT license, this service has permitted my network to grow to the top 25 of dn42 networks by number of BGP peers and graph centrality.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;eBPF programs often behave differently than developers expect, not because of incorrect logic, but because of subtle behaviours of the hookpoints themselves. In this talk, we focus on a small set of high-impact, commonly misunderstood attachment types — kprobes/fentry, tracepoints, uprobes, and TC/XDP and expose the internal kernel mechanics that cause surprising edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than attempting to cover all eBPF hooks, this session distills a practical set of real-world gotchas that routinely affect production tools, explaining why they occur and how to work around them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Training large models requires significant resources and failure of any GPU or Host can significantly prolong training times. At Meta, we observed that 17% of our jobs fail due to RDMA-related syscall errors which arise due to bugs in the RDMA driver code. Unlike other parts of the Kernel RDMA-related syscalls are opaque and the errors create a mismatched application/kernel view of hardware resources. As a result of this opacity and mismatch existing observability tools provided limited visibility and DevOps found it challenging to triage – we required a new scalable framework to analyze kernel state and identify the cause of this mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct approaches like tracing the kernel calls and capturing meta involved in the systems turned out to be prohibitively expensive. In this talk, we will describe the set of optimizations used to scale tracking kernel state and the map-based systems designed to efficiently export relevant state without impacting production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Any eBPF project that has started in the last couple of years is most likely written to take advantage of CO-RE, compiling your eBPF programs ahead of time, and being able to run that program on a wide range of kernels and machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before CO-RE it was common to ship the whole toolchain and compile on target. This is what Cillium currently still does. Compiling on target empowered a core value of Cilium: "you do not pay for what you do not use". But it turns out that with CO-RE sometimes you DO pay for what you do not use, which makes it painful to switch over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This payment mostly comes in the from of unused maps which still have to be created and loading tail calls which will never be called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created what we call "reachability analysis" which allows us to predict in userspace which parts of an eBPF program will be unused when loaded with a given set of global constants. This allows us to avoid creating maps that will never be used or load tail calls that will never be called, opening the way for Cilium migration to CO-RE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to show how this works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/parca-dev/oomprof"&gt;OOMProf&lt;/a&gt; is a Go library that installs a eBPF programs that listen to Linux kernel tracepoints involved in OOM killing and records a memory profile before your Go program is dead and gone.  The memory profile can be logged as a pprof file or sent to a &lt;a href="http://parca.dev/"&gt;Parca&lt;/a&gt; server for storage and analysis.  This talk will be a deep dive into the implementation and its limitations and possible future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Extending AF_XDP for fast co-located packet transfer</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;XDP and AF_XDP provide a high-performance mechanism for driver-layer packet processing and zero-copy delivery of packets into userspace, while maintaining access to standard kernel networking constructs — capabilities that distinguish them from full kernel-bypass frameworks such as DPDK. However, the current AF_XDP implementation offers no efficient in-kernel mechanism for forwarding packets between AF_XDP sockets in a zero-copy manner. Because AF_XDP operates without the conventional full network stack socket abstraction, even basic localhost redirection requires an external switch or additional hardware-assisted NIC capabilities, limiting both performance and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce FLASH, an extension to the AF_XDP subsystem that enables low-overhead, in-kernel packet transfer between AF_XDP sockets. FLASH provides zero-copy delivery for sockets that share a memory area and a fast single-copy datapath for sockets backed by independent memories. The design incorporates several performance-oriented mechanisms, including smart blocking with backpressure for congestion handling and an adaptive interrupt-to-busypoll transition to reduce latency under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that co-located applications using AF_XDP can leverage FLASH to achieve up to 2.5× higher throughput compared to SR-IOV-based approaches, while preserving the programming model and flexibility of the XDP/AF_XDP ecosystem. The talk will also outline future directions and how this technique can be applied across different use cases like DDoS mitigation, load balancing, etc.    &lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The eBPF eXpress Data Path (XDP) allows high-speed packet processing applications. Achieving high throughput requires careful design and profiling of XDP applications. However, existing profiling tools lack eBPF support. We introduce InXpect, a lightweight monitoring framework that profiles eBPF programs with fine granularity and minimal overhead, making it suitable for XDP-based in-production systems. We demonstrate how InXpect outperforms existing tools in profiling overhead and capabilities. InXpect is the first XDP/eBPF profiling system that provides real-time statistics streaming, enabling immediate detection of changes in program behavior&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;h1&gt;XDP Virtual Server: An eBPF Load Balancer library&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the looming retirement of our traditional load balancer appliances we decided to give XDP a try. Facebook's Katran library did not support layer 2 switching, which was still a requirement, so we built an eBPF application in C and a supporting library with Golang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came across a few issues along the way - driver support for network cards gave me headaches - but on the whole eBPF has made what would have been practically unthinkable a few years ago into a relatively straightforward task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library is used by an application which adds configuration management, BGP, metrics, etc., and  after testing on smaller services for some time the balancer now handles streaming audio and website content for the UK's largest commercial radio broadcaster, delivering tens of gigabits per second to our audience. COTS servers handle high volumes of traffic and can be trivially scaled/migrated when updated hardware comes along as simply as running an Ansible job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/davidcoles/xvs"&gt;The library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Unified I/O Monitoring Framework Using eBPF</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The interoperability of I/O monitoring and profiling tools is very limited due to their strong dependence on the underlying file system (LUSTRE, Spectrum Scale, NFS, etc) and resource managers (batch jobs, VMs, containerized workloads, etc). Widely adopted generic monitoring tools often lack the temporal information of the I/O activity which is often required to understand the I/O behavior of the applications. The increasing diversity of applications and computing platforms demands greater flexibility and scope in I/O characterization. This talk proposes a framework for monitoring I/O activity using extended Berkley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology which has gained much traction in observability and cloud-native landscape. By tracing the kernel’s Virtual File System (VFS) functions with eBPF, it is possible to monitor the I/O activity on different types of platforms like HPC, cloud hypervisors or Kubernetes. By storing the metrics traced by eBPF programs in a high performance time series database like Prometheus, it is possible to perform system-wide monitoring of computing platforms that use different types of local or
remote file systems in a unified manner. The current talk presents the basics of eBPF and discusses the framework that is used to monitor I/O activity in a file system and application agnostic way. It also presents the experimental results of quantifying the overhead and accuracy of the proposed framework using IOR benchmark results as the reference. The results indicate that there is negligible overhead in using the framework and bandwidths reported by the proposed methodology are in a very
good agreement with the ones from IOR tests. Finally, results from a production HPC platform that uses the proposed framework to monitor I/O activity on the LUSTRE file system are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to string handling, C is not the most ergonomic language for the job. But, at least, the standard library provides a basic set of functions for finding characters, comparing strings, or finding sub-strings. The same has not been true for eBPF programs where developers had to implement all the operations manually by looking into individual bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has changed in kernel version 6.17, which added a set of eBPF kernel functions (so-called kfuncs) to perform the most common string processing operations. While implementing these sounded like a very straightforward job at the beginning (just call the in-kernel implementations of the respective functions, right?), it turned out that eBPF programs have a number of specifics which required the implementation to be much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will walk you through this journey and show how and why the kfuncs have to be implemented differently from the in-kernel implementations. We'll also dive into the API specifics and demonstrate how string kfuncs have been adopted by bpftrace [1] and what benefits they brought.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to present the first major release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/pythonbpf/Python-BPF"&gt;PythonBPF&lt;/a&gt; and how other developers can start using it. The speakers will discuss the progress of this project since it was demoed at &lt;a href="https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2158/"&gt;LPC 2025&lt;/a&gt; in December 2025 (what actions were taken on the feedback gathered at LPC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PythonBPF is a project that enables developers to write eBPF programs in pure Python. We allow a reduced Python grammar to be used for the eBPF-specific parts of code. This allows users to:
- Write both eBPF logic and userspace code in Python (and can be in the same file), so the Python dev-tools apply to the whole file instead of just the non-BPF parts.
- Process eBPF data and visualize it using Python's ecosystem, and interactively develop and debug eBPF programs using Python notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Using eBPF within your Python program using EBPFCat</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;eBPF is a powerful technology, but it is often hard to use, because its
toolchain is non-trivial. In my talk I present
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tecki/ebpfcat"&gt;EBPFCat&lt;/a&gt;, a pure Python library that can
generate eBPF directly without any dependency on other code beyond the Linux
kernel. Unlike most eBPF implementations, no compiler is involved. Instead, the
user writes Python code which generates eBPF on-the-fly at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In EBPFCat, user- and kernel space are tightly integrated, so
that both eBPF and Python code can access the same data structures. This way,
one can use eBPF to write the performance critical parts of a program, while
retaining the versatility of Python for the bulk of the code. This opens eBPF
to a large audience who are interested in the performance boost by eBPF, but
are hesitant to learn an entirely new tool set for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will go through a simple example to show that using EBPFCat it is possible to
fit an entire eBPF program including its user space counterpart on a single
presentation slide. For this example I also show how EBPFCat generates the eBPF
bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While EBPFCat can be employed for usual eBPF use cases, I present one well
beyond typical systems-level applications: motion control. EtherCAT is a
standard field bus protocol based on EtherNet. Using eBPF we can reduce the
latency of communication with EtherCAT devices, allowing for real-time
performance. I will show a real-world combined motion system for physics
research that routinely uses EBPFCat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers new to eBPF will get a jump start into everything needed for their
first project, while experienced kernel developers will be surprised just how
far eBPF can take you beyond system programming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aya - what's new in Rust for eBPF?</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="ebpf">eBPF</track>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aya-rs.dev/"&gt;Aya&lt;/a&gt; is a library that allows writing &lt;a href="https://ebpf.io/"&gt;eBPF&lt;/a&gt; programs, as well as their user-space counterparts, entirely in Rust. It has been presented in previous editions of FOSDEM, but the project has evolved since then. In this talk, we will highlight what has changed, what’s coming next, and how these developments shape the Rust-and-eBPF ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, Aya has gained support for several new eBPF program types, as well as additional map types, such as the family of storage maps (sk_storage, task_storage, inode_storage). We’ve worked with the LLVM community to enable &lt;a href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html"&gt;BTF&lt;/a&gt; generation for Rust eBPF programs. The overall developer experience has continued to improve, and an increasing number of open-source projects are now building on top of Aya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also share updates on our ongoing work, most notably our efforts to promote Rust’s eBPF targets to &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html#tier-2-target-policy"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for building eBPF programs on Rust stable without requiring nightly toolchains. Alongside this, we are developing support for BTF relocation emission, refining the user-space XDP API, and broadening coverage of program and map types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will dive into the technical details behind these features, the architectural decisions that shaped them, and the challenges ahead. We will conclude with our vision for Aya’s future and how we see it moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;eBPF powers modern observability, but its behavior varies significantly across architectures. This talk examines whether eBPF can be used reliably on RISC-class systems—ARM64 and RISC-V—and what limitations appear in real workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use reproducible test environments to run tracing, profiling, and networking eBPF tools on x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V, revealing practical differences in verifier constraints, helper availability, JIT maturity, and performance overhead. RISC-V support exists but remains incomplete, and we show exactly which features succeed, fail, or behave unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a database benchmark as a workload generator, we compare instrumentation accuracy, latency impact, and stability across architectures. Attendees gain a clear understanding of eBPF’s practical portability and how to build a realistic multi-architecture observability testbed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;BPF Tokens are a new Linux kernel mechanism for delegating restricted eBPF privileges to unprivileged processes. This talk explains how distributions can adopt them to provide safer access to tracing, observability, and networking tools—without granting root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll show how token-based delegation could reshape developer workflows, container runtimes, and system services in Fedora or other distros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session includes a walkthrough of real token policies and discusses how distributions can help build a secure, less-privileged eBPF ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Web developers use open-source data all the time to help guide their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'd like to tell you more about this data, and in particular about &lt;a href="https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features"&gt;web-features&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source project which aims at being a reference data point for the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project contains the list of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; features of the web platform, at a level of granularity that's most useful to you, web developers. This project has gained a lot of traction over the past two years, in particular thanks to &lt;a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/"&gt;Baseline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline banners help web developers make quicker decisions based on the maturity of the web features they use, and are now visible on &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com"&gt;Can I use&lt;/a&gt;, and many other development tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline isn't the only consumer of the web-features data though. The data is starting to get used in more and more web-platform-related data which you rely on every, sometimes without realizing it.
The web-features project is making it easier to get access to information about the state of the web platform, in a practical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll go over the resources that make use of open source web-related data sources to help you stay aware of changes, but also discover new features, and make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also go over what web-features does not cover today, such as accessibility or progressive enhancements, and how these are areas that demand careful planning and implementation. I'll offer pointers showing how we're thinking about addressing these on the WebDX community group, and will invite contributions from those interested.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How does a website display a mathematical formula? More importantly, how can we ensure that all browsers show it the same way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mathml-core/"&gt;MathML Core&lt;/a&gt; is a small subset of &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/"&gt;MathML 3&lt;/a&gt;, specifically crafted for web browsers. It addresses inconsistencies in mathematical rendering across different browser engines. &lt;a href="https://www.igalia.com/"&gt;Igalia&lt;/a&gt; has been actively working on &lt;a href="https://conflor.es/blog/2025-11-27-interop-and-mathml"&gt;improving MathML interoperability&lt;/a&gt;, aligning the implementations of Firefox, WebKit and Chromium with this standard.&lt;/p&gt;

MathML's unique history makes the task particularly interesting, as it often required deprecating existing features or implementing significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>State of WebViews - Can we fix things?</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://caniwebview.com/about/"&gt;WebViews&lt;/a&gt; are everywhere—but fragmented, inconsistent, and often invisible to web developers. Used for in-app browsers, hybrid apps, and &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/miniapps/"&gt;MiniApps&lt;/a&gt;, WebViews form a significant part of the web platform that many developers unknowingly target. Some developers specifically build for WebViews in hybrid apps or MiniApps, while others create standard websites without realizing they'll run in WebView contexts with different behaviors and constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through initiatives like &lt;a href="https://caniwebview.com/baseline"&gt;Baseline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://caniwebview.com"&gt;CanIWebView&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://caniwebview.com/apps"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WebView-CG"&gt;WebView Community Group&lt;/a&gt;, we're working to map this fragmented landscape and identify paths forward. MiniApps that are very popular in some markets also show a very strong fragmentation and very little standardization. With collaboration and improvements between WebViews, MiniApps, PWA, new technologies like &lt;a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/web/isolated-web-apps"&gt;Isolated Web Apps&lt;/a&gt; or new engines like Servo there is good potential to improve the web in this space, but it's complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webview/"&gt;W3C WebView Community Group&lt;/a&gt; was formed to identify, understand, and reduce the issues arising from the use of software components (typically referred as WebViews) that are used to render Web technology-based content. As member and co-chair of the community group I'd like to give a little overview what WebViews are today, the work we've done to improve interoperability, and call to action to "fix things" in this overlooked but critical part of the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WebTransport is an upcoming protocol (standardized by the IETF) and Web API (standardized by the W3C) for bidirectional communication on the web. It provides multiplexed streams and unreliable datagrams on top of HTTP/3 and HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explains how WebTransport works at the protocol level, how it maps to QUIC when run on top of HTTP/3, and how its capabilities differ from WebSocket. The session will also cover the current state of browser and server support, and where the ecosystem is heading next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Web Components have become a bit of a divisive topic in the Web community in recent years. On the one hand you have platform advocates arguing Web Components are a boon to interoperability, can simplify tooling and distribution, and provide a common bed for experimentation and innovation. On the other hand, framework authors often complain that they complicate runtime code with special-cases and that Custom Elements are the wrong level of abstraction for framework components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lustre &lt;a href="https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; - a frontend framework for the functional programming language Gleam [2] - is bucking this trend; quietly using Web Components as a core building block of its runtime. In this talk we'll explore how Lustre can lean harder into the platform by adopting a different idea of what "components" should be, and how this can end up benefit framework users too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation provides a comprehensive status update on WebKitGTK and WPE, the Open Source ports of the WebKit Web rendering engine that Igalia maintains for Linux devices. These ports are currently being used in millions of devices (e.g. phones, set-top boxes, smart home appliances...), leveraging the flexible architecture of WebKit to provide HW-accelerated graphics and multimedia capabilities with a minimal resource footprint (e.g., memory, binary size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin by providing some context on what WebKit is and how WebKitGTK and WPE bring the power of the Web Platform to Linux-based devices and distributions. After that, we will summarize the current status of these ports, detailing the latest and most important highlights of the work done in the past year, followed by a description of what the new developments will be focused on during 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux ports have experienced huge changes recently, including a massive refactoring of its graphics pipeline, the development of a new API for embedded devices, dma-buf support for zero-copy buffer sharing, a complete revamp of its QA infrastructure, and even adding support for Android. With all this in mind, this session should be useful for anyone interested in creating Web-based products on Linux devices, understanding the current state of these ports, and seeing where development is headed next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Servo project, now hosted under Linux Foundation Europe, is a modern Rust-based rendering engine pushing forward safety, modularity and high-performance web rendering. After its early foundations at Mozilla and a couple of years of impasse, Servo entered a new chapter in 2023 when Igalia took over stewardship, ensuring long-term maintenance, open governance, and a clear technical direction for the project. The Servo community has continued to grow steadily since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll review the recent evolution of the project together with the plans for the future. Apart from that, we’ll focus on the impact of this work in the whole web platform, by finding issues in specifications and improving them, reporting interop bugs, contributing new tests, etc.; showing that the development of new web engines benefits the whole ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern web applications face a constant barrage of attacks targeting authenticated user sessions, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), clickjacking, Cross-Site Leaks (XS-Leaks), and even Spectre. Fortunately, recent advancements in web browser security provide developers with powerful tools to mitigate these threats. This talk delves into the latest web platform security features, equipping you with the knowledge to protect your applications. We'll explore CSP3, Trusted Types, Fetch Metadata headers, and COOP, demonstrating how these mechanisms can effectively thwart entire classes of web vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;File uploads are a ubiquitous and fundamental part of modern web applications. While simple at first, they become increasingly challenging as file sizes grow. Users expect reliable data transfers, even when uploading multi-gigabyte files over unreliable mobile networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional file uploads over HTTP fail unrecoverably when the underlying connection is interrupted. Resumable uploads, on the other hand, allow an application to continue uploading a file exactly where it left off. This preserves previously transferred data and greatly improves the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, resumable uploads were implemented in proprietary ways, with each application building its own solution. Developers couldn’t benefit from the advantages of resumable uploads without investing significant engineering effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, we started the &lt;a href="https://tus.io"&gt;tus project&lt;/a&gt; and created a free and open-source protocol for resumable uploads. The project and its community provide implementations for various client and server runtimes, making it easy today to add resumable uploads to any application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, we began engaging with the HTTP Working Group at the IETF to make resumable uploads a standardized extension to HTTP. Our goal is to integrate resumable uploads directly into browsers, HTTP clients, servers, and proxies so that even more developers can easily benefit from their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the past and present of resumable uploads and how upcoming standards will help developers deliver exceptional file-upload experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, researchers exposed a major tracking vulnerability - Local Mess, where Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica scripts were exploiting localhost access to track millions of Android users across the web. This talk presents Local Network Access (LNA) standards and how it addresses similar threats and helps fix long standing security vulnerabilities with localhost and local network devices. The talk explains the LNA specification and how it categorizes network requests into public, local, and loopback address spaces, requiring explicit user permission when websites access more private network zones. The presentation covers Firefox's implementation, key differences from Chrome's approach, real-world deployment challenges and mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly (Wasm) 1.0 specification is a linear memory system suitable as a compiler target for static languages like C and Rust. However, the recently released Wasm 3.0 specification, which includes garbage collected reference type instructions, has opened the door to using all kinds of dynamic languages on the web. Wasm GC compilers already exist for languages such as Java, Scala, Kotlin, OCaml, and Scheme. However, the value of Wasm GC is often misunderstood! In this talk, I'll attempt to clear things up by examining the benefits and drawbacks of Wasm GC at present and how compiling to Wasm GC stacks up against compiling to JavaScript (or just using plain ol' Javascript). I'll conclude with a brief look at some proposals from the Wasm Community Group that could improve Wasm GC in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A large number of Linux applications have been developed over the years. Reusing them allows developers to reduce development costs, leverage well-established and battle-tested applications, and gain significant benefits by porting them to WebAssembly (Wasm). Migrating Linux applications to the browser as Wasm offers several advantages, such as:
    1.  Developing browser-based applications by reusing existing Linux libraries
    2.  Protecting client privacy and reducing server load by moving server-side Linux applications into the browser
    3.  Building browser-based systems that rely on Linux applications that are traditionally difficult to port (e.g., shells, compilers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, I will introduce elfconv, a binary translator that directly converts existing Linux binaries into Wasm without requiring their source code and provides a layer for emulating Linux system calls. This enables Linux applications that depend on system calls unavailable in Wasm (e.g., fork/exec) to run inside the browser.
Furthermore, by performing ahead-of-time (AOT) translation, elfconv achieves dramatically lower overhead compared to CPU-emulator-based projects such as container2wasm and v86. Our evaluation on several benchmark tests shows that elfconv delivers approximately 30× to 70× higher performance.
At the moment, the system call emulation layer in particular is still under development, but I believe that as elfconv matures, it will greatly expand the potential of the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The old Servo Streams implementation was relying on SpiderMonkey’s own stream implementation. In the latest SpiderMonkey versions, that stream implementation was removed, which prevented us from updating the version in Servo. So we reimplemented the Streams spec without the built-in SpiderMonkey implementation, and we ended up implementing WritableStream and TransformStream.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When talking about CSS, we generally speak about how it’s super nice to have good looking websites, introduce a new feature and how to use it, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, we’d like to speak about a feature that has been into the CSS specifications since 1998, and that we don’t talk about very often: CSS for print 🖨️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, we’ll show how CSS can be used not to only create web pages, but also beautiful and structured paged documents. Interested in generating reports, invoices, tickets, or even slideshows? Take a look at which tools − except your favorite web browser − you can use to accomplish that, and why it’s very convenient in particular for automating documents generation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;systemd supports a number of integration features that allow VMMs certain access to the inner state of VM guests for provisioning, synchronization and interaction, and many of them are little known, even though very very useful. In this talk I'd like to shed some light on many such integration points, such as SMBIOS type 11 based system credential provisioning; state propagation/readiness notification via AF_VSOCK; SSH support via AF_VSOCK, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern confidential computing technologies like AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX provide a reliable way to isolate guest workload and data in use from the virtualization or cloud infrastructure. Protecting data at rest is, however, not something you get ‘by default’. The task is particularly challenging for traditional operating systems where users expect to get full read/write experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Linux OS already offers a number of great technologies which can be combined to achieve the goal: dm-verity and dm-integrity, LUKS, discoverable disk images and others. Doing it all right, however, is left as an “exercise to the reader”. In particular, the proposed solution must allow for meaningful remote attestation at any time in the lifetime of the guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will focus on the recent developments in various upstream projects like systemd and dracut which are focused on making full disk encryption consumable by confidential computing guests running in a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It has been several years since the last &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-vmm/community"&gt;rust-vmm&lt;/a&gt; update at FOSDEM, but the community has continued to grow. Our goal remains the same: to provide reusable Rust crates that make it easier and faster to build virtualization solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the main progress and achievements from the past few years. It reviews how rust-vmm crates integrate into a variety of projects such as Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, Dragonball, and libkrun. We will discuss the ongoing efforts to consolidate all crates into a single monorepo and how we expect this to simplify development and releases. The talk will also cover recent work supporting new architectures like RISC-V and additional operating systems. Finally, we will review the support for virtio and vhost-user devices that can be used by any VMM.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;QEMU 10.2 will introduce MSHV as a new accelerator option for Linux hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSHV is a kernel driver maintained by Microsoft's Linux System Group that aims to expose HyperV capabilities to users in various virtualization topologies: on bare metal, in nested virtualization and most recently via a new model called "Direct Virtualization".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct virtualization will allow owners of an L1 VM to commit parts of their assigned resources (CPU, RAM, Peripherals) to virtual L2 guests, that are technically L1 siblings. Users can take advantage of the hypervisor's isolation boundaries without the performance and functional limitations of a nested guest. Untrusted code can be sandboxed with near-native performance and access to GPUs or NVMe controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding support for MSHV acceleration to QEMU aims to broaden the reach of this technology to a Linux audience. The talk will cover the current state of the implementation, challenges that remain and future plans for both MSHV and QEMU.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Typically, device emulation is performed directly inside the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), like &lt;a href="https://www.qemu.org/"&gt;QEMU&lt;/a&gt;. However, modern virtualization stacks support multiple implementation models: keeping the device in the VMM, moving it to the kernel (vhost), offloading it to an external user-space process (vhost-user), or offloading it directly to the hardware (vDPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each approach comes with specific trade-offs. Emulating in the VMM is straightforward but can be a bottleneck. In-kernel emulation offers high performance but increases the attack surface of the host system. External processes provide excellent isolation and flexibility, but introduce complexity. Finally, vDPA (vhost Data Path Acceleration) enables wire-speed performance with standard VIRTIO drivers, but introduces hardware dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we decide which approach is best for a specific use case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore all four methods for emulating VIRTIO devices. We will analyze the architectural differences, discuss the pros and cons regarding performance and security, and provide guidance on how to choose the right architecture for your use case.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how a Raspberry Pi can run a complete open-source cloud using OpenNebula. With MiniONE handling the installation and KVM doing the virtualization, a Raspberry Pi becomes a small but fully functional cloud node capable of running VMs, containers, lightweight Kubernetes clusters and edge services. The goal is simple: demonstrate that homelab users can build a full cloud stack with compute, networking, storage and orchestration on affordable hardware using only open-source tools. A short demo will show a VM launching on a Pi-based OpenNebula cloud, highlighting how the platform scales down to tiny devices while keeping the same clean and unified experience found on larger deployments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of providing seamless Layer 2 connectivity and mobility for KubeVirt virtualized applications distributed across multiple clusters (for reasons like disaster recovery, scaling, or hybrid cloud), we integrated OpenPERouter, an open-source project that provides EVPN-based VXLAN overlays, solving the critical need for distributed L2 networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenPERouter's declarative APIs and dynamic BGP-EVPN control plane enable L2 networks to stretch transparently between clusters, maintaining VM MAC/IP consistency during migrations and disaster recovery. This architecture facilitates deterministic cross-cluster live migrations, better supports legacy workloads needing broadcast/multicast, and enables migrating workloads into the KubeVirt cluster while preserving original networking using open components. Routing domains are also supported for traffic segregation and to provide direct routed ingress to VMs, eliminating the need for Kubernetes services to expose ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will gain the practical knowledge to design and implement resilient, operationally safe, EVPN-based overlays with OpenPERouter, receiving actionable design patterns and configuration examples.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"GPU clouds" for AI application are the hot topic at the moment, but often these either end up being just big traditional HPC-style cluster deployments instead of actual cloud infrastructure or are built in secrecy by hyperscalers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explore what makes a "GPU cloud" an actual cloud, how requirements differ from traditional cloud infrastructure, and most importantly, how you can build your own using open source technology - all the way from hardware selection (do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to buy the six-figures boxes?) over firmware (OpenBMC), networking (SONiC, VPP), storage (Ceph, SPDK), orchestration (K8s, but not the way you think), OS deployment (mkosi, UEFI HTTP netboot), virtualization (QEMU, vhost-user), performance tuning (NUMA, RDMA) to various managed services (load balancing, API gateways, Slurm etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the purely technical side, we'll also go into some of the non-technical challenges of actually running your own infrastructure and how to decide whether this is something that's actually worth doing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Your Workloads Can Lose Some Weight: WebAssembly on Kubernetes</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What if your container image were a few megabytes instead of hundreds of megabytes? &lt;a href="https://webassembly.org/"&gt;WebAssembly (WASM)&lt;/a&gt; offers a radically lighter approach to running workloads on &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; — right alongside your existing containers.
In this talk, we'll dive deep into how WASM modules using the &lt;a href="https://wasi.dev/"&gt;WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)&lt;/a&gt; integrate into Kubernetes through &lt;a href="https://containerd.io/"&gt;containerd&lt;/a&gt; shims like &lt;a href="https://github.com/containerd/runwasi"&gt;runwasi&lt;/a&gt;. Using a &lt;a href="https://rust-lang.org/"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; example, we'll demonstrate the dramatic reduction in image size and startup time compared to traditional containers. We'll explore the current state of WebAssembly in the cloud-native ecosystem: what's production-ready today, and where you should wait before adopting.
Beyond the basics, we'll look at real-world Cloud-Native Compute Foundation (CNCF) projects already running WASM in production and discuss the two areas where WebAssembly shines: plugin architectures that benefit from small, secure, sandboxed extensibility, and event-driven systems that can quickly scale from zero. Whether you're optimizing for resource efficiency or exploring new isolation patterns, this session provides insights into WebAssembly on Kubernetes and serves as a great starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With KubeVirt, Virtual Machines become first-class citizens in Kubernetes, allowing VMs and containers to be managed through a unified control plane. As organizations evolve their infrastructure, many early adopters face the challenge of upgrading systems without disrupting essential services. To support this, KubeVirt provides powerful mobility capabilities for both compute and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KubeVirt enables non-shared storage live migration through QEMU's block migration feature, which is orchestrated by libvirt and KubeVirt components. The core process involves copying the VM's disk data and memory state to the destination node while the VMI remains running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Cluster Live Migration (CCLM) extends this capability across Kubernetes clusters, allowing a running VM to be moved seamlessly between clusters. This enhances flexibility and resilience in multi-cluster environments and is especially useful for load balancing, maintenance operations, and infrastructure consolidation – all without interrupting critical workloads. CCLM requires L2 network connectivity between clusters and compatible CPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage Live Migration (SLM) allows you to move the VM’s disk data from one storage backend to another while the VM remains running. This is particularly valuable when rebalancing storage usage, retiring legacy systems, or adopting new storage classes – all without disrupting the applications inside the VM. SLM requires at least two compatible nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CCLM and SLM work with any storage backend, including those using the ReadWriteOnce access mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the session, you’ll be ready to migrate your running VMs – across clusters and across storage – with confidence, like a seasoned scheduler placing pods exactly where they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lima (Linux Machines) is a command line tool to launch a local Linux virtual machine, with the primary focus on running containers on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lima was originally made for promoting containers (particularly containerd) to Mac users, it has been known to be useful for a variety of other use cases as well. One of the most edgy use cases is to run an AI coding agent inside a VM, in order to isolate the agent from direct access to host files and commands. This setup ensures that even if an AI agent is deceived by malicious instructions searched from the Internet (e.g., fake package installations), any potential damage is confined within the VM, or limited to files specified to be mounted from the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the updates in Lima v2.0 (November 2025) that facilitates using Lima with AI:
- Plugin infrastructure
- GPU acceleration
- MCP server
- CLI improvements&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will present a new extension to Prowler, the widely adopted open-source cloud security auditing tool, adding native support for the OpenNebula cloud management platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our contribution delivers a modular, non-intrusive, and scalable auditing framework that integrates essential services and a growing catalogue of security checks aligned with established reference standards. This extension enables operators to detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities more effectively, strengthening the overall security posture of OpenNebula deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through the design and implementation of the tool, share validation results from real test scenarios, and outline how this effort helps democratize cloud security within the open-source ecosystem. Finally, we will discuss opportunities for community-driven collaboration to expand and evolve this new security auditing capability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;KubeVirt allows running VMs and containers on Kubernetes, but traditional Kubernetes networking - which uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to expose workloads outside the cluster - can still lead to complex, opaque, and brittle setups that prevent direct integration and reachability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation introduces a BGP-based solution to simplify KubeVirt networking. Kubernetes nodes dynamically exchange routes with the provider network, exposing workloads via their actual IPs, eliminating NAT and manual configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This BGP approach simplifies network design, speeds up troubleshooting, and ensures consistent connectivity for virtualized workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn practical, standard networking principles to simplify real-world Kubernetes environments and gain immediate, actionable insights to improve platform connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Platform engineering teams tackle complex, multi domain challenges, balancing governance and iterating quickly to enable developers. In this session we’ll detail how SUSE IT uses Kubewarden as a policy controller across both RKE2 and SUSE Virtualization environments. We’ll show how enforcing organizational policies with Kubewarden automatically integrates compliance and operational excellence into the core of the platform. We’ll discuss practical examples, e.g., how to restrict usage of resources, GPUs or VLANs to specific customers while providing the platform to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present the current state of remote VM access in KubeVirt [0] and the challenges associated with it. We will discuss in-guest approaches such as running an RDP server on Windows or Linux, as well as host-side mechanisms like QEMU’s built-in VNC server exposed through KubeVirt’s virt-api. Finally, we will introduce a new proposal that leverages QEMU’s display-over-D-Bus interface [1], a direction that could enable additional vendors to build their own remote-display integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Serving large video diffusion models to multiple concurrent users sounds challenging till you partition a GPU correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a deep technical exploration of running large-scale video generation inference on modern GPUs across Hopper and Blackwell with Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPU MIG topology: Memory hierarchy, interconnect partitioning, and leveraging high-bandwidth memory effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory profiling for inference: Tracking GPU memory allocation across the generation pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIG profile selection: Choosing partition sizes—when isolation beats raw throughput&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request scheduling: Fair queuing for heterogeneous workloads and batch sizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure modes: OOM recovery, MIG instance health checks, and graceful degradation strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring at scale: Per-instance GPU metrics and detecting performance bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're building a multi-tenant inference platform, optimizing GPU utilization for your team, or exploring how to serve video diffusion models cost-effectively, this talk provides practical configurations for your AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>MBEC, SLAT, and HyperDbg: Hypervisor-Based Kernel- and User-Mode Debugging</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Virtualization has transformed low-level debugging, system analysis, and malware research. By placing a thin hypervisor beneath the OS, developers gain a vantage point the OS cannot access. This blue-pill approach enables fine-grained control over CPU state, memory, interrupts, and hardware events without relying on OS components, supporting transparent breakpoints, VM-exit triggers, memory shadowing, and instruction tracing with minimal interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present HyperDbg, an open-source hypervisor-based debugger. Leveraging the former characteristics, unlike kernel debuggers that depend on drivers, APIs, or software breakpoints, HyperDbg operates entirely below the OS, combining virtualization-based introspection with interactive debugging. It inspects memory, CPU execution, and traps events without OS cooperation, bypassing anti-debugging and anti-analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using modern virtualization extensions like Mode Based Execution Control (MBEC) on top of Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), HyperDbg enforces breakpoints and traps through hardware transitions, independent of OS APIs or exceptions. This allows stealthy, artifact-free binary analysis, providing a powerful platform for reverse engineering and research. In its first iteration, HyperDbg introduced a hypervisor-powered kernel debugger. With the recent release of v0.15, HyperDbg enables cross-boundary debugging from kernel-mode into user-mode. For this talk, we will add special focus on how we implemented cross-boundary debugging, and how it enables users to intercept user-mode process execution using virtualization techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FFmpeg is the most versatile multimedia codec and format support library, and was one of the first open-source project to include some RISC-V-specific optimisations, though there is still a long way to go. The RISC-V Vector extension was also the first scalable vector extension to be supported. We will cover the background, challenges and outcomes of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A discussion of historical lessons that RISC-V did learn from, and mistakes that it repeated. 
Focused on the design constraints forced by RVC and RVV, as well as the choices around breaking out the F and D profiles out from a mandatory vector unit, and the state changes that come with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad context will be specific to OoO SS processors&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>State of the Arch: Fedora on RISC-V</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Efforts to port Fedora Linux to RISC-V began in 2016, long before physical hardware was accessible to developers. Today, the vast majority of Fedora packages have already been ported to riscv64 (i.e. the RV64GC baseline) and OS images—both generic and board-specific—are available for recent releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is currently an &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt; architecture in Fedora, so these (non-official) images are built by a dedicated team of community contributors, the Fedora RISC-V team. However, the end goal is to make RISC-V a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; architecture on Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what changed since the last update at DevConf 2024? What does the path for RISC-V to become a primary architecture on Fedora look like? What are we currently working on and what are our future plans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond software, we'll also survey the current hardware reality. Today several development boards are available. If one is getting started with RISC-V today, what board to pick? We'll review the available hardware, from the "VisionFive 2" to other capable boards, and outline our experience building Fedora on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whether you have a board on your desk or just a desire to contribute, there are many ways to help push Fedora’s RISC-V journey across the finish line. Join us to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll present the pain and joy of working on a BootROM we use for booting our RISC-V SoC prototypes in the lab, with networking capabilities. First I'll give an overview on how writing bare metal code looks like, the challenges one has to deal with, and how we solved it in a prototype-independent way. Then I'll present netboot as an example use case, give an idea of the constraints we had to deal with and where they came from, why such a thing is a requirement when working with SoC prototypes (or even in production), how I did it, and finally do a live demo if time permits.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I gave a talk about running upstream embedded Linux on RISC-V with the powerful SpacemiT K1-based Banana Pi BPI-F3 as an example. Fast forward one year, and we have many a new contender on the block.
This talk first revisits the BPI-F3, looking at the upstreaming progress made and issues remaining.
Secondly, it introduces the new Siflower SF21H8898-based Banana Pi BPI-RV2, the ESWIN Computing EIC7700-based EBC77 with SiFive HiFive Premier P550 cores and the Ky X1-based Orange Pi RV2 and R2S. Those are all interesting new boards I added to my embedded Linux testing lab. Comparing the various downstream vendor options with the upstreaming efforts will show us the overall progress embedded Linux has made on RISC-V.
Last but not least, I will discuss the upcoming RVA23-compatible boards based on chips like the SpacemiT K3 SoC with its X100 cores, the Tenstorrent TT-Ascalon IP SoC, the UltraRISC UR-DP1000 and the Zhihe A600 SoC.
The time is truly ripe for embedded Linux to shine on RISC-V!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>RISC-V Hardware Is Here. What About Software?</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RISC-V hardware momentum is everywhere: more tape-outs, more open cores, more startups, and increasingly affordable boards that everyone can try. But hardware alone doesn’t make a usable platform. From blinking LEDs to critical space exploration missions, adoption depends on the software ecosystem being mature, well-integrated, and ready for developers to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how ready is RISC-V software today? Toolchains, kernel support, hypervisors, RTOSes  and simulators are all evolving, but progress happens at different speeds across the stack. Users still encounter rough edges, and contributors often struggle to navigate the ecosystem and find where help is needed most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares a personal journey through RISC-V software enablement: from building Linux images and contributing to Zephyr, to enabling hypervisors and firmware. I’ll highlight what’s solid, what’s still forming, and the challenges faced along the way - and how anyone can begin contributing and using RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How Secure Are Commercial RISC-V CPUs?</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="risc-v">RISC-V</track>
        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The last decade of CPU vulnerabilities has shown how microarchitectural performance optimizations can undermine isolation. Transient execution attacks like Meltdown and Spectre exposed deep flaws in x86 CPUs. RISC-V, by contrast, enters with the promise of simplicity and transparency—a clean slate. Yet the question remains: will we repeat the same mistakes, or can we design a secure architecture from the start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk takes a critical look at how RISC-V implementations handle microarchitectural security today. We show that even "simple" in-order designs already suffer from architectural flaws and powerful side channels. In our earlier work, we demonstrated novel attacks, such as Cache+Time and CycleDrift, on the first commercial RISC-V CPUs, exploiting unprivileged access to instruction-retirement counters and cache-timing leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But manual analysis does not scale. RISCover, our open-source differential fuzzing framework, automatically discovers architectural vulnerabilities across closed-source RISC-V CPUs. By comparing instruction behavior across 8 commercial CPUs from 3 vendors, RISCover found what manual analysis missed: GhostWrite, a bug in T-Head's XuanTie C910 that lets unprivileged code write directly to physical memory, completely bypassing virtual memory isolation. We also discovered multiple "halt-and-catch-fire" sequences that crash CPUs from userspace, leading to denial-of-service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal a pattern: while the RISC-V specification provides strong security primitives (e.g., PMP and cleaner privilege separation), implementations consistently choose insecure defaults—leaving unprivileged timing sources enabled, shipping undocumented vendor extensions like XTheadVec without proper validation, and omitting features to limit speculation.
RISC-V is at an inflection point: the architecture is still young enough to fix, but adoption is accelerating fast. The decisions vendors make today—insecure defaults, unvalidated extensions, missing mitigations—will be baked into billions of chips we cannot patch.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Why buy a bottle when you can have your own keg? Open source hardware might not shout “free beer” but the new Unified RISC-V IP Access Platform, maintained by OpenHW Foundation, is just that – free recipes for your own free-flowing beer. 
From CVA6 superscalers to UVM support on Verilator, Chips JU project TRISTAN has united Europe’s biggest industry players with academia to move open source semiconductors from the lab to the real world. Now with the UAP, you can benefit from all of this hard work.
In this talk, you’ll get uncensored access to recent advancements in European RISC-V, and a demonstration of how you can immediately leverage industry-ready open source designs from projects across Europe, all explained with glorious beer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the course of the past months, Michael has contributed to support for OrangePi RV2 and R2S in the mainline Linux kernel (6.19+), in Yocto's meta-riscv BSP layer and hopefully before FOSDEM 2026, in the U-Boot bootloader. Hoping to attract more users and contributors, and to inspire owners of other RISC-V boards, this presentation will review what has been done so far and the necessary steps to achieve this. It will also cover what's left to do on each board.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the course of building out the &lt;a href="https://observatory.cyber.harvard.edu/"&gt;Fediverse Schema Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/berkmancenter/activitypub-fuzzer/"&gt;ActivityPub Fuzzer&lt;/a&gt; I changed how I write my small ActivityPub servers. I used to follow Mastodon's playbook, where I transformed incoming activities into a relational database model, breaking each activity out into rows across an &lt;code&gt;accounts&lt;/code&gt; table, a &lt;code&gt;statuses&lt;/code&gt; table, a &lt;code&gt;favorites&lt;/code&gt; table, and so on. But since learning that relational databases like SQLite and Postgres contain high performance functions for parsing JSON, I have moved to a hybrid model that blends features of relational databases and NoSQL JSON databases. This approach is not new, and there are reasons it hasn't been embraced in other contexts, but I think it is uniquely suited to ActivityPub's interaction model and could be a fruitful avenue for more developers to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I describe:
 - how to do it
 - concrete benefits of doing it
 - helpful patterns I've learned
 - drawbacks and caveats&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WordPress joined the fediverse more than 15 years ago and is still the underdog, but the potential is huge, after all, nearly 40% of the internet is powered by WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how WordPress made its way into the fediverse (or the other way around), what the fediverse can learn from WordPress and the blogosphere, and how the fediverse can have a positive impact on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress doesn’t come from the same place as social platforms. Unlike platforms built purely for social interaction, WordPress is driven by a very different set of needs, priorities and expectations. I want to give a few insights into how running your own ActivityPub instance can feel as easy as installing a plugin (and why that’s only half of the truth). Plus, a short sneak peek into what we’re currently working on to make WordPress a full flavored, fully featured ActivityPub instance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The social web is bigger than software. It’s a movement to build a liberated internet for the people, and it will take all of us working together to deliver on that promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a decentralised social networking platform powered by free software which allows users and institutions to create and join independent communities. It's also the nonprofit foundation that supports them, and looking after the humans of the social web is core to the Mastodon foundation’s mission. If you’ve been following us closely, you’ll know we just completed a radical transformation of our foundation's operations. One reason we did this was to support more direct community participation in shaping and deciding the future of Mastodon. In the coming year, we’re also planning to increase our efforts with and on behalf of the communities we support and that surround us: from server admins to the broader social web and Fediverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Mastodon’s new Community Director Hannah Aubry will share the foundation’s plans for evolving how the project approaches its many communities, from server admins to the broader social web. Bear in mind this isn’t just a talk; it’s an invitation to co-create the future of Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The web is facing a critical moment. In an era of geopolitical fragmentation and relentless platform &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification"&gt;enshittification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we cannot afford to remain dependent on Big Tech gatekeepers for our digital voices. The Social Web offers an alternative—but only if we actively claim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll show you how to establish genuine digital sovereignty by federating different content types across the Fediverse. Through live demos of Mastodon (microblogging), Pixelfed (images), and Castopod (podcasting), we'll demonstrate how these independent platforms seamlessly federate via ActivityPub—allowing you to own your content, control your audience relationships, and maintain your voice across media types without surrendering to corporate platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we'll do together:&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Understand why now matters&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll examine the geopolitical and economic forces driving platform consolidation and why decentralization is a democratic imperative
- &lt;strong&gt;Break the enshittification trap&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll show how platforms extract value by degrading service, and why federation breaks this cycle
- &lt;strong&gt;See federation in action&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll demo cross-platform federation live—posting from Castopod, watching interactions appear in Mastodon, building community across instances
- &lt;strong&gt;Get you started&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll give you concrete next steps to migrate your digital presence to the Social Web&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this session, you'll know exactly where to start. If you have a laptop, you can host a podcast on the Fediverse—and we'll show you how. The tools exist. The community is ready. Let's take back control of how we communicate, create, and connect online.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reaching out to the wider society:  Why the open social web needs to matter to more people – and how we can achieve that goal</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="social-web">Social Web</track>
        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The German-European initiative Save Social proposes a 25 minutes session focused on broadening the involvement of society in the development and stewardship of the open social web. Despite immense progress in establishing open alternatives like Mastodon or Friendica, today's open social web has struggled to connect with and empower the wider public, often because structural support has concentrated on technical advancements rather than inclusive engagement and content diversity.
A handful of global platform monopolies dominate – as we all know - public discourse and information, undermining democratic exchange and transparency. While open alternatives exist, their reach is limited without the structural, content, and educational investment needed to engage broader segments of society. Current alternatives have not always made participation intuitive or relevant for users from fields outside the technology sector, which limits their impact and hinders genuine diversity in dialogue and innovation.
Therefore the future of the social web is not just a matter for developers, but for everyone—requiring regulatory support, media education, and the creation of citizen committees to define public-good requirements. The session will highlight specific, actionable pathways for different sectors to join the open web movement, making digital democracy a society-wide project rather than a niche initiative, e. g.:
    • Frame the strategy around a clear democratic and social purpose, not only technical openness.
    • Frame strategies around stories and lived experiences instead of only technical roadmaps.
    • Treat communities as Co-desginers, move from “getting feedback” to “sharing authorship.”
    • Assume most people are not protocol experts and design engagement accordingly.
    • Build bridges to sectors of society
Save Social's proposal is for a session that inspires and equips participants to break silos and bring the open social web to everyone, ensuring it serves as a democratic, accessible, and resilient foundation for the digital society of the future.
Save Social is a network of 120 individuals, being supported by more that 260.000 signatories from Germany, collectively covering journalism, the arts, unions, startup founders, established economic leaders, public institutions, and research. This cross-sector representation is unique and powerful, fostering collaboration and a user-centric approach to digital democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many ActivityPub servers have a feature to follow a hashtag locally -- subscribing to receive all the content with a particular hashtag that your server knows about, as it arrives. Could we provide a similar feature across the Fediverse? tags.pub is a project to implement that feature -- collecting tagged content and redistributing it by hashtag. In this talk, Evan will discuss the motivations behind tags.pub, its implementation, and outline future steps for global hashtag services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since Mastodon, a prominent adopter of ActivityPub, developed its own client API, it has been embraced by various projects, even reaching beyond microblogging platforms. 
Despite its potential, the ActivityPub Client-to-Server API has received minimal attention, leading many platform developers to overlook it in favour of building bespoke or third-party solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk will explore the unfulfilled promise of a general-purpose client built on ActivityPub's Client API. By developing a general-purpose client app, participating in the specification work, and addressing its shortcomings, we can initiate a new cycle of client app development. This approach will empower platform developers to innovate new services, fostering broader adoption and exploration of ActivityPub’s Federation capabilities across diverse platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

I'll cover its unique mix of features from traditional social bookmarking sites such as del.icio.us and pinboard, feed readers, and graph-based tools like Obsidian or are.na.
I'll explain how this works as a companion when exploring the small web as part of tightly knit communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digital laws like the GDPR or the DSA do not really differentiate between Big Tech and the Social Web. This makes many service providers in the Fediverse feel insecure. So far, the Fediverse is not so much on the screen of authorities. But the rise of authoritarian governments raises fears that digital rules could be used as an arbitrary instrument of power against the Fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this circumstance should not lead us to follow the narrative that the digital economy needs "simplification" or "deregulation". The opposite is true: Regulation gives the Fediverse a chance to compete with Big Tech. The lack of enforcement rewards the service providers who do not comply with the law. What the Fediverse needs is rather more legal certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an overview about the legal pitfalls that service providers in the Fediverse are facing. It explores possible amendments or exemptions in the law that could make life easier for the volunteers in the Fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss the collaborative efforts that began in 2025 with the aim of establishing an advocacy network for the social web. While the developer community is flourishing with the support of the Social Web Foundation and others, few communicators have raised their voices and made demands addressed to the political sphere, such as the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As social web engaged people with professional backgrounds in policy work and communication have become involved in social networks in Europe, interest and efforts to strengthen communication and political demands in the European digital policy landscape have grown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be approachable by interested lawmakers and public organizations, we need advocacy networks. What goals and benefits could be achieved through such networks? They would enable regulatory influence and support, secure public funding, and help advocates to sit on public and non-public panels. This would enable them to raise awareness and advocate for decentralised social networks as a means of achieving digital sovereignty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our important political messages is to emphasize the importance of social networks as a fundamental building block in the pursuit of digital sovereignty in and for Europe. Social networks should also be recognized as a service that must be included in discussions about Eurostacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get those and other messages heard and repeated, we need more people to join these efforts. In my talk, I will discuss the current state of stewardship of the open social web, and the political goals we should aim to achieve in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a concise introduction to Fedimedia Italia, a federation of projects run by Fediverse admins, hacktivists, and developers, and its mission to promote the Fediverse and free software across Italy and explores the experiences of Mastodon.uno and the Devol collective in advancing the federated social-web (the Fediverse) in Italy. Since its creation, Mastodon.uno has become one of the largest and most active Mastodon instances worldwide, and a central hub for the Italian-language Fediverse community. 
The talk also presents some projects in development, focusing on FediPress, a WordPress plugin that enhances the official ActivityPub with a mobile-friendly, messenger-like PWA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedimedia Italia is a non-profit association promoting decentralized technologies, free software, and digital rights, aiming to build an ethical online ecosystem as an alternative to Big Tech platforms. Founded by a federation of hacktivists and developers committed to digital sovereignty, Fedimedia Italia is a key pillar of the Italian Fediverse, with members managing instances and contributing to projects such as Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Mobilizon and additional 9 federated services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk we will outline the technical challenges required to maintain a stable federated network: server infrastructure, moderation policies, interoperability, scalability issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine the social and adoption challenges: how to attract and retain users, trust building, and overcoming network-effect inertia compared to centralized Big Tech platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share the lessons learned by Fedimedia admins over 7 years of operation with mastodon.uno: successes, failures, tensions; and how they reflect the broader difficulties of establishing a truly distributed, privacy-centric alternative to corporate social media especially in a national/language-specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exposing both the technical backbone and the human/community challenges, the presentation aims to provide a helpful roadmap for those who want to create a federated social networks. It will be particularly relevant for: developers, sysadmins and open-source activists interested in decentralized social infrastructure, community governance, and the practical trade-offs of building a “free web.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FediVariety, a research initiative supported by the NLnet and SABOA foundations, has analyzed the European Data Protection Supervisor's pilot project, "EU Voice/Video". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our upcoming report, scheduled for publication in early 2026, will offer key insights and recommendations for integrating the Fediverse into public administrations. This report aims to spark open dialogue among diverse practitioners, encouraging experience sharing and fostering new collaborations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At FOSDEM, we will present preliminary insights from our research and invite participation in an unconference in Amsterdam on March 19-20, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on our findings, we aim to explore how the Fediverse can effectively support public institutions in the long term, addressing critical questions about its future and strategies for developing and adopting decentralized social media. We seek to create a broad coalition and welcome developers, administrators, content managers, moderators, coders, digital activists, and open-source enthusiasts committed to fostering sustainable alternative social media and promoting an open social web.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Public institutions are beginning to take an active role in the Fediverse, integrating ActivityPub platforms into their communication and identity ecosystems. This shift brings specific organisational challenges: introducing large and diverse user groups to decentralised networks, aligning institutional identity with the logic of the Social Web, establishing internal responsibilities, and ensuring that data protection and communication standards translate into federated environments.
This talk reflects on the experience of introducing a Mastodon instance at the University of Innsbruck, where more than 5,000 staff members can access the Fediverse through the university’s Single Sign-On system. The focus lies on the institutional layer of Fediverse adoption: designing onboarding procedures, coordinating collaboration between departments, developing moderation and communication guidelines, and embedding ActivityPub into established workflows.
In addition, the talk highlights what the Social Web ecosystem needs in order to better support institutional participation: more flexible onboarding paths, clearer role and permission models, moderation tools suited to organisational contexts and interfaces that help bridge institutional communication cultures with the norms of decentralised networks.
The aim is to outline how institutions can adopt ActivityPub at scale and contribute meaningfully to the Social Web, not only as operators of individual services, but as active partners in shaping open, federated digital spaces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The needs of civil institutions for The Next Socials</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="social-web">Social Web</track>
        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Civil organizations like libraries, schools, government agencies and NGO’s base their efforts on public values over financial profit. In their everyday operation however they often rely on tools that do not align with these public values: Big Tech platforms that sell user data as a commodity, suppress voices, increase polarization and undermine democracy and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While alternative tools and platforms are available, public institutions are often reluctant to start using them. At PublicSpaces, www.publicspaces.net, we work with 40 of these larger public institutions like libraries, museums, broadcasters, local governments and health and education institutions. All these partners share a common goal: to communicate on platforms that align with their public mission and public values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this as a single institution is often difficult. Institutions often lack the knowledge, the funds or the expertise to create and manage new platforms. By working together we hope to strengthen our efforts, share knowledge and create a common ecosystem. Some of the project we worked on were PeerTube Spaces, a pilot to set up video as a digital commons, the Make Social Social again campaign in which we help institutions to take the first step together by using alternatives to Big Tech social media platforms and the Fediverse Helpdesk we will start in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know from conversation with or partners what the common bottlenecks and holdback towards adoption of alternative platforms are, we would like to underpin this knowledge with actual data. For this talk we will send out a survey to a representative section of our partners institutions about what the mayor issues are with the use of alternatives are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will analyze and visualize this data, combine it with our experience in working with public institutions and  and present it in a developer friendly form. With this talk we hope to give insight into improvement the developer community can to help public institutions, and their clients,  users, citizens, etc. adopt alternative platforms. We will try to answer questions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• What hare the main holdbacks for civil institutions towards wider adoption of Fediverse tools?
• What technical and other improvements would help civil institutions adopt Fediverse tools?
• What types of support and knowledge sharing are needed?
• What type of organization and governance are needed to support this?
• How can the Fediverse community help civil institutions and how can civil institutions help the Fediverse community?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Decentralised Badges with BadgeFed: Implementing ActivityPub-based Credentials for Non Profits</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="social-web">Social Web</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I volunteered at a non-profit where the go-to digital badge platform (e.g., Credly) was explicitly prohibited due to cost, vendor lock-in and rigid workflows. We needed a badge system for volunteer recognition, skill tracking and event participation — yet the high price and closed ecosystem killed it every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how BadgeFed was born, an open-source, federated badge system built on the ActivityPub protocol and the Open Badges standard. Because it’s an instance you control, deployable in minutes, fully federated and self-hostable, it overcame the cost/lock-in barrier and unlocked recognition for our volunteer community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we move digital badges out of locked-down platforms and into the federated social web? In this talk I’ll walk through how BadgeFed, an open-source credentialing system built on the ActivityPub protocol and aligned with the Open Badges spec, powers non-profits to issue, share and verify badges across Fediverse instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why traditional badge systems are brittle and siloed, and how a decentralised model flips that dynamic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How BadgeFed implements ActivityPub actors, badge issuance as federated objects, and federated discovery. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Community Credentials uses the stack to empower nonprofits and volunteer programs: federated badges that survive issuer shutdowns, open standards, self-hostable instances, social graph integration. 
communitycredentials.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What remains challenging: federation scaling, discovery/search of badges across instances, identity portability, moderation/trust issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps for BadgeFed and federated credentials in the Social Web ecosystem, and how you as a dev or org can pick it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to deploy a federated badge service, integrate it with their tools, and contribute to a social-web native credentialing future..&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://splinter.hastily.cc/"&gt;Splinter&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for Mastodon threads. Splinter turns long articles into Mastodon threads and posts them for you automatically. It started as a project for educational purposes for using Mastodon's API. It ended up being a tool that people actually use!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's make threads great again, see what Splinter offers, and which challenges exist when developing for Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Bonfire: Building Modular, Consentful, and Federated Social Networks</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bonfire is an open-source, modular platform for creating federated social networks and communities that put users and groups in control. Bonfire’s architecture is designed to be deeply extensible: each instance can enable or disable features, adapt its onboarding, workflows, or governance, and even fork or create extensions or apps for their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will showcase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making federation easy for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;: See how Bonfire enables developers to connect any new or existing app to the fediverse with much less effort, so these apps can instantly communicate and collaborate with other platforms just by plugging into our standards-based API (ActivityPub C2s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live demos in action&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ll demonstrate this approach with real examples, like creating and sharing events that connect seamlessly between the Lauti events app, Bonfire, and Newsmast's mobile apps. Resulting in a seamlessly integrated networked ecosystem. We’ll also present our work on secure, interoperable, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonfire's modular approach&lt;/strong&gt; with extensions and "flavours" (collections of extensions and default settings) that adapt to diverse use cases, from research to activism to local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learned from co-designing&lt;/strong&gt; features with scientists, activists, and other diverse communities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re curious about building your own platform, adding ActivityPub to a new tool, or shaping the “next layer” of federated protocols (groups, moderation, decisionmaking, trust), Bonfire’s approach, code, and community offer a living experiment in interoperability and mutual care.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fedify: Building ActivityPub servers without the pain</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="social-web">Social Web</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Implementing ActivityPub looks simple at first—it's just JSON over HTTP, right? Then you hit JSON-LD context resolution. Then HTTP Signature verification fails on Mastodon but works on Misskey. Then you realize the spec spans hundreds of pages across W3C documents and &lt;a href="https://w3id.org/fep/"&gt;FEPs&lt;/a&gt; (Fediverse Enhancement Proposals), and every implementation interprets them differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through this pain building &lt;a href="https://docs.hollo.social/"&gt;Hollo&lt;/a&gt;, a single-user microblogging server. Halfway through, I realized I was building a framework instead of an app. So I extracted that framework and called it Fedify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fedify.dev/"&gt;Fedify&lt;/a&gt; is an opinionated ActivityPub framework for TypeScript. It handles the protocol plumbing so you can focus on your application logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type-safe vocabulary:&lt;/em&gt; The Activity Vocabulary spec is loosely defined, but Fedify maps it to strict TypeScript types. Your IDE knows that &lt;code&gt;Note.content&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;LanguageString&lt;/code&gt;, and calling &lt;code&gt;await create.getActor()&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;Actor&lt;/code&gt; object. No more guessing at property shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comprehensive signature support:&lt;/em&gt; Fedify implements four authentication mechanisms—HTTP Signatures (draft-cavage), HTTP Message Signatures (RFC 9421), Linked Data Signatures, and Object Integrity Proofs (FEP-8b32). For HTTP Signatures, it uses &lt;a href="https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-http-signature/#how-to-upgrade-supported-versions"&gt;double-knocking&lt;/a&gt;: trying RFC 9421 first, falling back to draft-cavage if rejected, and remembering the preference. This kind of interoperability work is exactly what you shouldn't have to do yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Framework-agnostic design:&lt;/em&gt; Fedify works as middleware for Hono, Express, Fastify, Next.js, or any framework that speaks &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt;. Bring your own database, ORM, and auth—Fedify only needs a key–value store for caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLI toolchain:&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;code&gt;fedify inbox&lt;/code&gt; command spins up an ephemeral server to receive and inspect activities. &lt;code&gt;fedify lookup&lt;/code&gt; fetches any ActivityPub object by URL or fediverse handle—including from servers that require &lt;a href="https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-http-signature/#authorized-fetch"&gt;authorized fetch&lt;/a&gt;. No need to create throwaway accounts on production instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also share production stories: &lt;a href="https://activitypub.ghost.org/day-4/"&gt;Ghost chose Fedify&lt;/a&gt; for federating their publishing platform rather than implementing the protocol themselves. Hollo demonstrates single-user microblogging with full Mastodon API compatibility. &lt;a href="https://hackers.pub/"&gt;Hackers' Pub&lt;/a&gt; shows how a developer community can integrate with the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're building a new federated service or adding ActivityPub to an existing app, this talk will show you how Fedify turns months of protocol wrangling into days of actual development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Friendica has been part of the Fediverse since 2010, building bridges between Laconica and Diaspora*, making it one of the oldest active projects of the Fediverse - yet Friendica has flown under the radar most of the time. After the great success of part I of the saga, Michael and Tobias want to present you part II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will expand on &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5289-friendica-under-the-radar-since-2010/"&gt;our brief introduction&lt;/a&gt; from last year, showcasing additional features and the latest developments in the 2025 release of Friendica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the Friendica project homepage at &lt;a href="https://friendi.ca"&gt;friendi.ca&lt;/a&gt;; the source code for the core is maintained on GitHub, and the add-ons are maintained on git.friendi.ca.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Death is inevitable, yet most of us are woefully unprepared. Fear and lack of time often prevent us from putting our affairs in any order, leaving our loved ones to pick up the pieces of a difficult period compounded by uncertainty. While a legal will can address the distribution of assets, it often falls short in capturing the nuanced personal wishes that truly matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will propose how machine readable wishes could be used to provide to connect to the fediverse and provide digital legacy to friends and followers. In line with the wishes of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 10min talk&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The "social web" is at a crossroads. To have a meaningful impact on society means growing beyond our roots among tech enthusiasts and social misfits. But growth and change cannot sacrifice the core values that differentiate the social web from closed media systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be one part a manifesto for the social web, and one part technology demonstration showcasing Emissary -- my proposed solutions for the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digital Public Infrastructure is needed for resilient societies in Europe, but not just there: All over the world, government and civil society offer digital services to their constituencies. And increasingly, they have become aware of the risks that come with using infrastructure owned by a few large companies under a jurisdiction that traditionally was not necessarily ranking their interests very high and these days have become rather unpredictable. The judges and employees of the International Criminal Court are making this very visible, losing their digital life due to being sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session shows how the GovStack [1] initiative empowers government and societies by openly specifying building blocks for such services, thus avoiding the dependencies.
The presenter has contributed to the cloud building block [2]. Naturally, the specifications also need implementations which can be qualified for the GovMarket [3], with a strong preference for Open Source solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter will present the specifications and will also provide insight into the OSS implementation for the cloud building block.
He can report on cloud trainings in African countries and work done with GIZ, ITU and UNICC to empower these countries to create modern IT without falling into the dependency trap that European countries by and large have fallen into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost 10 years, the Foundation for Public Code has been working with public administrations and their partners to better develop public digital infrastructure together.  Through many collaborations between cities., states, and other public institutions, we have come to realize that all projects that hope to become sustainable implementations in the context of the public sector would benefit from a well formed nonprofit vehicle that has a strong governance model, financial model, community practice, open license, and continuous integration process.  We have been working with multiple members state governments in the European Union, and with several in the European commission, on defining a legal form for a new type of NGO that we call the public product organization.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PPO, a non-profit vehicle built specifically to develop and steward an open digital public asset [like a software product, dataset, content database, or machine learning model] would become the hub for collaborations among a constellation of public and private partners and establish a strong governance model, provide context and support for a community of practice, and maintain access to an array of developers who could take on specific work packages set out in a shared roadmap, or do bespoke implementations for specific local administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that building the policy infrastructure to enable the easy creation of vehicles that allow for this type of collaboration will unlock an economy that thrives based on the contribution of a huge network of small software development studios across Europe.  By enabling the creation of an NGO subtype that is specifically qualified to serve as a steward of digital assets, we can de-risk institutional engagement with open source options in procurement, and begin to design sustainable funding mechanisms that support a newly flourishing ecosystem of digital public infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation for Public Code have served in the process of the creation of products, born from the pioneering work of teams in public administrations and their vendors, who have created some of the most celebrated digital public infrastructure in Europe.  In the past, we have called ourselves "codebase doulas", helping products move out of a development cycle funded by a single public institution, which leaves them vulnerable to political change and less capable of engaging with an array of partners at peer administrations.  Now we are helping guide projects toward realization as fully collaborative nonprofit stewardship vehicles.  Projects like Decidim [https://decidim.org/], X Road [https://x-road.global/], DIIA [https://expo.diia.gov.ua/], and Gov.UK Notify [https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/]&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This roundtable will bring together FOSS product owners and governments to engage in a strategic discussion around two interrelated areas:
1) How to assess the technical maturity using the draft Universal Software Maturity Indicators (v0.1) https://github.com/DPGAlliance/CoP-Maturity-Indicators
20 How to assess institutional readiness of government to adopt, scale, and maintain FOSS projects in the context of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion will explore how these two dimensions: software maturity and institutional readiness can be better aligned to guide investment decisions, promote responsible implementation, and reduce barriers to adoption across countries and sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this session aims to:
- Collect multi-stakeholder feedback on the draft Universal Software Maturity Indicators, including their structure, clarity, and relevance across diverse implementation contexts. 
- Explore what governance or incentive mechanisms are needed to ensure that such assessments are actually used—for example, in procurement, donor funding, or partnership processes. 
- Initiate dialogue on how to assess government readiness to adopt and scale FOSS and DPIs, with reference to the existing tools, such as the E-government Development Index, the World Bank's Open Data Readiness Assessment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtable will provide space for constructive discussion, exchange of experiences, and co-creation of next steps toward strengthening maturity and scalability of FOSS from both sides, software and government readiness. This session will ultimately build alignment with stakeholders to explore solutions to share challenges regarding maturity indicators.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;1 year ago, EU OS put out an architecture for a common Desktop Linux for the public sector. Since then, EU OS had many closed-room conversations with public servants from several member states and with various open source communities. EU OS also published a how-to for a DIY Proof-of-Concept (PoC). This talk explains briefly the vision and PoC of EU OS, gives a summary of the feedback received so far and formulates the public sector expectations on the underlying Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>LaSuite.coop: A Public–Cooperative Model for Digital Commons</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Across Europe, institutions are seeking credible, sovereign, open alternatives to proprietary cloud platforms. France’s public digital agency, DINUM, took a bold step in that direction by developing La Suite, a fully open-source service stack. What is unique is not only the openness of the code, but the ambition: that a public administration can edit and publish digital commons for the public good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But building a commons is only the first step. Ensuring long-term adoption, usability, and sustainability requires an ecosystem. This is the role of LaSuite.coop, a SCIC (Société Coopérative d’Intérêt Collectif), which extends La Suite beyond the administration to local governments, universities, associations, cooperatives, and civil society. As a democratic, multi-stakeholder cooperative, LaSuite.coop enables users not just to access the tools, but to co-govern them — reclaiming strategic control over their digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaSuite.coop brings together several open-source service providers — Open Source Politics, Yaal, lebureau.coop, Galae— who mutualise development, DevOps, hosting, support, UX, and community engagement. This model funds open-source development sustainably without enclosure, venture capital, or extractive business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores how La Suite and LaSuite.coop illustrate a public–private–commons partnership model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a public entity creating and guaranteeing the commons,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a cooperative ecosystem maintaining and scaling it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a community steering its evolution,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and a sustainable business model aligned with the public good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this hybrid model offers a concrete blueprint for future European digital commons.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Scaling national open-source products across Europe: lessons learned from two years of cross-border state collaboration</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, DINUM (the French Interministerial Digital Directorate) set out to answer a simple question: How do you turn promising national open-source products into shared European products?
Two years later, after 2 consortium projects, cross-border hackathons, and several experiments with EU funding mechanisms, we have accumulated a set of practical insights forged through coordination with other EU partners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk offers an experience-based walkthrough of what worked, what didn’t, and what we wish we had known earlier. Attendees will leave with concrete takeaways for initiating or strengthening cross-border open-source collaborations within public administrations. We hope to invite partners like Zendis or the Lisbon Council to bring their perspective to these cooperations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why we started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of DINUM products communities grew rapidly inside France, but we wanted to test whether it could become part of Europe’s shared digital infrastructure (Eurostack). Our goal was not to “export” code, but to evaluate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to co-develop open-source modules with other Member States,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to make reuse realistic across different administrative cultures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how to try to pool efforts and resources and leverage EU funding to support sustainability rather than siloted prototypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What we tried (and what we learned)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This objective can be accomplished through the establishment of a European strategy for the funding and development of open source products led by member states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out other enthusiastic European partners capable of co-developing or utilizing open source digital products to increase the number of active users in the EU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinpoint the most appropriate European funds for these topics to pool and leverage national investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit applications for relevant project calls with suitable partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote awareness within member states, particularly among product/project managers, about the opportunities to work with open source with European partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case 1 : The 100Days Challenge: iterative hackathons, real code&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use case 2 : GovTech4All: 16 partners, 3 pilots, 3 sustainability challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see this talk as an opportunity to inform and connect with European partners across various administrations to encourage cooperation and lay the groundwork for future projects&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While digital sovereignty is increasingly prompted on European and National levels, the urgency and risks implied have yet to reach the regional and local levels of government. Building robust public digital infrastructure and services on open source foundations have potential both in addressing risks while also providing a substantial economic up-side considering how public digital services are mirrored across regional and local borders. This talk shares insights from a cross-country, multiple-case study investigating how collaboration, sharing, and reuse among local governments are actively forging sovereignty from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on detailed examples—including democratic engagement platforms, public desktop solutions, open data infrastructure, parliamentary transparency tools, and national public transport systems —the session highlights governance models and practical mechanisms enabling local actors to translate policy ambitions into operational, interoperable, and sovereign public digital infrastructure. By foregrounding how municipal IT teams partner with foundations, non-profits, and each other, the presentation illustrates how public digital infrastructure that can be adapted and reused across borders, tailored to local needs yet scalable for European cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will gain concrete recommendations for institutionalising open source in public service delivery, developing community capacity, and ensuring public values are embedded in digital infrastructure. The session advocates for bottom-up, collaborative approaches, demonstrating that digital sovereignty is not merely a national top-down project. Attendees, including policymakers, practitioners, and technologists eager to operationalise digital sovereignty at local and regional levels, will benefit from actionable narratives and strategies grounded in real, European experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full report with all case studies are openly available via OSOR: https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/multiple-case-study-public-sector-open-source&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sovereign software in the cloud? Many projects are taking care of that. FOSS services running on servers? Lots of excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;
But what about your office, the place where you work? Is your local network just invisible infrastructure at the mercy of whatever vendor you picked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will show you how we built and operate the "Flurfunk" network prototype at BSI (German Federal Office for Information Security). Flurfunk is a Proof of Concept wireless and wired network with a sizable number of human users with purely FOSS infrastructure: Routers, Switches, WiFi Access Points and a Certificate Authority, all of them running FOSS firmware, operating systems and services. This whole infrastructure is centrally orchestrated and requires almost zero maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic lies in OpenWrt https://openwrt.org/ (for the network components) and Smallstep step-ca https://smallstep.com/open-source/ combined with OpenSSL https://www.openssl.org/ (for the CA), as well as Debian https://www.debian.org/ , Das U-Boot https://u-boot.org/ and coreboot https://www.coreboot.org/ (behind the scenes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the network supports the latest and greatest in authentication standards (WPA3 Enterprise), but it also offers user-friendly setup for users and admins. This includes automated certificate rollout to all centrally managed laptops and smartphones for WLAN access via WPA3 Enterprise. Yes, Flurfunk aims to be CRA compliant ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, all components are current off-the-shelf hardware and yes, installing OpenWrt on them is easy (no tools needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Flurfunk is not a production network nor does it come with support, it's a PoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to stand on the shoulders of giants as we do, and replicate the setup for your own network? 
Of course the configuration files for all components as well as links to the relevant firmware/OS images will be provided for download. Where applicable, existing tutorials/wikis have been improved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building Mzansi Xchange: Open Source Approaches to Secure Data Exchange in South Africa's Digital Public Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s digital future depends on robust, scalable, and inclusive Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). My talk introduces the core components and foundational principles of DPI, highlighting the latest directions in the South African Digital Transformation Roadmap, as unveiled by The Presidency. We’ll discuss why governments globally—including South Africa—are embracing Open Source solutions to reduce vendor lock-in, foster innovation, and ensure transparency, while exploring local challenges around adoption, interoperability, security, and compliance with regulations like POPIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of my session is a real-world use case: building Mzansi Xchange, a secure, national data exchange platform co-designed with government and built primarily on Open Source software. We’ll unpack the architectural choices, implementation milestones, and hands-on lessons the project team learned, from aligning with the National Data and Cloud Policy to establishing federated data governance and deploying secure Open Source software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The openCode Badge Programme promotes quality, security, and reusability of open source software in public administration. Part of the openCode platform run by the German Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS), it automatically evaluates repositories against defined criteria and awards badges in areas such as security and maintenance, which are visible in the openCode catalogue. The Badge Programme is an integral part of ZenDiS and the German Federal Office for Information Security’s (BSI) strategy to strengthen the security of software supply chains in public administration. By creating clear incentives to meet standards and supporting informed decisions when reusing software, the programme shows how open source development and use can be fostered in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2024 France and Germany signed an agreement to cooperate on building an open source digital workspace. As part of this collaboration, DINUM (France), ZenDiS (Germany) and MinBZK collaborated on building a modern Open Source Document editing product (Docs) on top of modern &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this, they collaborated with the existing open source libraries: BlockNote and Yjs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will share our joint experience in financing core features such as exports, comments,  edit attribution, and suggestions. We'll explain:
- What the collaboration looked like in practice
- How funding core libraries can help you build your own Sovereign solutions efficiently
- Challenges and differences between funding libraries and Application-Level solutions
- Broader ecosystem benefits&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As European public sector organizations pursue digital sovereignty, the technical migration from proprietary to open source solutions is only half the battle. Technology is often the easy part. The real challenge lies in transforming not just infrastructure, but mindsets, workflows, and institutional culture. True independence requires successfully leading organizational change - preparing teams, managing resistance, and building confidence in open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares proven change management strategies from leading IT transformations and guiding public sector clients through transitions from Jira to OpenProject, demonstrating how to build sustainable and resilient digital ecosystems that serve citizens rather than vendors. You'll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-create change through proven leadership best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create ownership for the open source solutions within public sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the business case and frame the open source narrative that resonates with public sector stakeholders and decision-makers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive the mindset shift to FOSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify your use cases and foster transition to open source products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build internal champions who drive adoption across departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from real-world public sector experiences and Rosanna Sibora's experience in driving IT transformations, this session reveals the human factors that make or break digital sovereignty initiatives. Whether you're planning your first migration or looking to improve your change management approach, you'll leave with actionable frameworks for leading successful transitions to independent and interoperable digital workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many public bodies, NGOs and small providers in Europe want to move away from US‑dominated cloud platforms, but struggle to build and run their own stack with small teams and limited capacity. At the same time, the threat landscape makes it urgent to build more resilient infrastructure for critical public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAPPaaS is a trusted, automated and privacy‑friendly Platform as a Service, built only with Free and Open‑Source Software, that makes it easier for small teams to run sovereign workspaces and public digital services. In this talk, we present the TAPPaaS blueprint and show how we combine existing FOSS building blocks into a sovereign, standards‑based stack that can be operated by SMBs, NGOs and local governments with limited resources. We highlight how automation and common patterns reduce operational effort, improve security and resilience, and avoid lock‑in to proprietary hyperscalers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAPPaaS is work in progress, so we share what already works well in pilots and prototypes, where we still hit hard problems, and which trade‑offs we made along the way. Attendees will leave with a concrete blueprint for running a sovereign PaaS with a small team. TAPPaaS comes with pre selected modules and integrations that can reuse in their own public or civic infrastructure, and clear ways to get involved as consumer, operators or contributors in shaping TAPPaaS as a building block of Europe’s public digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In France, thanks to the deployment of 37 million Linky smart meters, a vibrant open-source community has emerged, developing smarter, greener, and more open energy-management systems powered by Linky’s locally emitted data. Enedis, the main French DSO, now works alongside this community to accelerate the use of its meters’ data for the energy transition. Open hardware, open software, open data—all of this is key to meeting the challenges !&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Akkudoktor-EOS - Build optimized energy management plans for your home automation</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS"&gt;Akkudoktor-EOS&lt;/a&gt; (Energy Optimization System) is an open-source platform designed to generate highly optimized energy management plans for home energy management systems. Initially developed by Dr. Andreas Schmitz (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Akkudoktor"&gt;“Akkudoktor”&lt;/a&gt;), EOS has been publicly available for just over a year and has already built a community of users who integrate it into their home automation environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, EOS is a self-hosted server that calculates optimal schedules for batteries, electric vehicles, and household devices. These plans are derived from user configuration, real measurement data, and automatically retrieved or self-generated forecasts. EOS focuses on long-term optimization over a day or longer. The home automation system manages short-term control. Together, they combine strategic planning with real-time execution, delivering the best of both worlds in home energy management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common applications include optimizing consumption under dynamic electricity tariffs, ensuring cost-efficient EV charging, shifting flexible loads to cheaper periods, and connecting seamlessly with systems such as Home Assistant or NodeRED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EOS stands out through its genetic algorithm, enabling optimization of any behavior that can be simulated—without the limitations of linear or convex models. Non-linear battery degradation, grid-stress signals, comfort models, or heat pumps with non-linear COP fields can be used directly, without artificial simplification. This makes EOS highly modular and flexible, allowing new components or physical models to be added and immediately included in the optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Optimally planning the energy flows across multiple sites becomes more important, e.g. for orchestrating the aggregated flows due to grid congestion, or for implementing energy sharing. This approach can break bottlenecks and increase savings - as such, energy communities are an important topic for the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present our ongoing work towards a Community Energy Management System (CEMS) with FlexMeasures. We discuss our architectural approach: optimizing the flows for each sites by themselves and then adding an orchestration layer on top. This approach is being tested in a project with TNO in the Netherlands. The goal is to manage neighbourhoods as well as commercial sites optimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we want to discuss how scalable any CEMS system can be, as many circumstances and conditions often vary, per site and per energy community. We chose our CEMS architecture approach for this reason, but versatility has been a design principle for FlexMeasures since the beginning. In this talk, we will showcase a complete example script of a setup orchestrating a few homes. This script is written with the FlexMeasures client and is also open source. FlexMeasures being 100% scriptable is a design choice that lets many developers built just what they need in energy intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also an opportunity to visit some fundamental improvements we have made in the last year in the documentation of FlexMeasures and its flexibility options - both for developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Creating at Open Source Global Solar Forecast and Dashboard</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Solar energy is predicted to be the largest form of power generation globally by 2040 and having accurate forecasts is critical to balancing the grid. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy resources are unpredictable in terms of power generation from one hour to the next. In order to balance the grid, operators need a close estimate of when and how much solar and wind power will be generated on a given day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Climate Fix (an open source AI company) developed and deployed PVNet, a large ML model which forecasts solar generation for the next 36 hours. The forecasts are used by the UK electricity grid operator for real-time decision making and for reserve planning. These forecasts can save 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ and £30 million per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we have a global impact? We decided to build a lightweight solar forecast that works anywhere in the world, which we showcased last year at FOSDEM. Combining this with every country's solar capacity, we are able to produce a solar forecast for every country in the world. In this talk, we'll demo our Global Forecast and discuss how this forecast can support grid transition as well as open-source renewable energy projects all over the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Climate Fix is an open-source not for profit company using machine learning (ML) to respond to the need for accurate renewable energy forecasts. Connecting energy industry practitioners with ML researchers doing cutting-edge energy modelling is our aim, and one way we seek to do this is by making much of our code open-source.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Storing energy reversibly is useful. For clean energy, electrochemical batteries are one of the most attractive options. Most battery technology is proprietary, hard to recycle, and complicated to manufacture. What if that wasn't the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will present our collective and individual efforts with the Flow Battery Research Collective (https://fbrc.dev/) to build open-source batteries for stationary storage applications. This includes our flow battery work, such as efforts to build a larger-format cell with simple manufacturing techniques like laser cutting and FDM printing, as well as our different experiments with flow battery electrolytes based on zinc, iodine, iron, and manganese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also cover our individual efforts to build conventional, non-flow flooded batteries based on water and the above elements (including this work by the speaker Daniel: https://chemisting.com/2025/05/23/a-low-cost-open-source-cu-mn-rechargeable-static-battery/). We will discuss the economic hurdles facing practical implementations of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As a student in electronics, I was already passionate about renewable energy.  Then after many years of open-source software development, I am now finally starting to engage with the Energy community.  By attending various events, meeting a whole range of inspiring people, hacking around existing projects and completing a &lt;a href="https://gtucker.io/tags/energy/"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; series on Digital Substations and &lt;a href="https://lf-energy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEAP/overview"&gt;SEAPATH&lt;/a&gt;, I have made the first steps in this personal journey.  It is already a very rewarding one and I believe many other developers would relate to it.  Open source culture and renewable energy both contribute to a more sustainable world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lightning talk tells the story of how I became an active contributor in the Energy community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Standards like OCPP and ISO 15118 describe how EV charging should work, yet real-world deployments often behave differently. This session explains why a full stack of tools, testing methods, and feedback loops is essential for true interoperability, and how the open-source EVerest ecosystem has become a practical integration point for these technologies. We will show how Software-in-the-Loop testing, Golden SUT validation, conformance tooling, virtual charger parks, testing-hackathons, and cloud-based remote debugging work together to close the gap between specification and reality. The talk demonstrates how open-source reference implementations can strengthen standards, improve certification tools, and reduce interoperability pain across the EV charging industry.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenLEADR-rs is an opinionated, open-source Rust implementation of the OpenADR 3.0 protocol, which is already being used for real-world pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this joint presentation, Stijn van Houwelingen (ElaadNL) and Maximilian Pohl (Tweede Golf) will kick things off with a quick primer on demand response: what it is, and why it’s essential to accelerate the energy transition. From there, they’ll dive into some design decisions behind OpenLEADR-rs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the decisions explored: why Rust was a good choice for the protocol and why OpenLEADR-rs did not implement real-time updates yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the focus shifts to adoption, specifically focusing on the use case of Grid-Aware Charging in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk then wraps up with a look at what’s next for OpenLEADR-rs, including our effort to implement OpenADR version 3.1, how developers and organizations can get involved, and what early adopters can expect in terms of support and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;See how the open-source Transformer Thermal Model helps safely push the limits of the grid.
This to lighten the net congestion problem we have in the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;
We demonstrate how simulating hotspot and oil temperatures reveals new acceptable load limits.
By sharing this model openly, we are able to work with other TSOs and DSOs to benefit and strengthen sector-wide collaboration! Within this talk we want to show you our journey in going open source and how this strengtens our effort in lighten the net congestion problem with pushing the limits of the grid!&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The lack of global access to electricity, and the push towards renewable energies and electrification requires us to develop our grids. However, globally, data of the power grids are outdated, incomplete or closed off, which makes it challenging for us to effectively plan and research grid developments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we created an initiative called MapYourGrid where anyone can map, contribute and own the data of our grids. We created a fully open and free toolchain, combining developed and existing free tools and software, in order to empower people around the world to be able to map their grid. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we collaborated with existing communities and incorporated existing open-source tools, as this leads to higher quality workflows and higher community impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mapping the world’s power grids, anyone can learn and understand the backbone of what lets us turn our lights on, as well as owning this valuable data. This can then be used by researchers, local communities and authorities, NGO’s and many more, to help solve pressing issues our world faces.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The electricity grid faces increasing complexity as solar panels, wind turbines, EVs, and heat pumps reshape both supply and demand patterns. Grid congestion has become one of the most pressing challenges for utilities navigating this transition. Accurate short-term load forecasting is essential—not only for congestion management, but also for transport forecasts, EV charging capacity estimation, and grid loss prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenSTEF is an open-source Python package that provides accurate short-term forecasting for all of these use cases. As demand grows beyond congestion management, we have been working with the community on a major redesign to make it more flexible and easier to adopt across different contexts and user types—from researchers and small-scale teams to large-scale deployments within complex enterprise landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will share the journey and architecture of the OpenSTEF V4 redesign, how we did it, the lessons we learned, and a sneak peek of the features of the current alpha release.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce &lt;strong&gt;µSolarVerter&lt;/strong&gt;, our open-hardware micro-inverter designed to support decentralised solar production while giving users full control over the information their system generates. The project grew from a simple question: &lt;em&gt;how do we make small-scale solar both understandable and adaptable, without locking people into a black box&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our presentation will be split into three parts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Design Journey — focusing on what people actually use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll walk through the design process by following the things users interact with most: &lt;strong&gt;clear and accessible data&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;a flexible software layer&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;hardware platform&lt;/strong&gt; that supports both without getting in the way. The story is about enabling insight and experimentation: good telemetry, open interfaces, and a control system that stays transparent, all backed by a converter designed to be efficient, safe and repairable without requiring deep power-electronics expertise. Hardware is there, but it’s not the centrepiece — it’s the foundation beneath a system meant to be explored, extended and trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Deliverables — µSolarVerter as a platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll show you how we made &lt;strong&gt;µSolarVerter as a platform&lt;/strong&gt;, built with the intention of gathering a community around it. We will unveil our &lt;em&gt;open documentation, open firmware and open data flows&lt;/em&gt;, making it easy to integrate with domotics systems like Home Assistant or openHAB, or to build your own dashboards and analysis tools. Users can experiment with their own production/load-matching logic, develop new applications, or simply keep their data fully local. The openness is practical: it’s there to be used, not just admired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Invitation — unveiling the beta program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will introduce our &lt;strong&gt;OwnTech beta program&lt;/strong&gt;, inviting participants who want early access to the platform, to test it, review it, or contribute improvements. Whether you are interested in decentralised energy, open design, or taking a more active role in your own solar production, this is a chance to get involved from the start and help shape where the project goes next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the evolution of VeraGrid (formerly GridCal), a power-system simulation tool, over the past decade; From its humble and simple beginnings to a fully integrated software capable of performing all power-system calculations, ranging from electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations to multi-year investment planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout its development, the software has undergone seven major refactors to accommodate new functionalities. As the system evolved, the effort required for each refactor decreased, highlighting an organic, evolutionary structure shaped by practical needs and use cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss the challenges and insights gained during this evolution, focusing on how we integrated static network models, time-series data, transient analysis, and long-term planning. Additionally, I will cover how we overcame the challenges of multi-binary pitfalls and ensured seamless interaction between these diverse functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will provide an overview of how these continuous improvements have produced an open-source tool that bridges the gap between research, operational applications, and long-term infrastructure planning.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypsa.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyPSA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source Python framework for optimising and simulating modern power and energy systems, designed to scale well with large networks and long time series. It is made for researchers, planners and utilities with basic coding aptitude who need a fast, easy-to-use and transparent tool for power and energy system analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first public version was released in 2016 and has since gained many users and contributors from around the world, becoming one of the most &lt;a href="https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/home/users/"&gt;widely used&lt;/a&gt; energy system modeling tools. In October 2025, &lt;a href="https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/v1-guide/"&gt;version 1.0&lt;/a&gt; was released, which now enables modeling under uncertainty with a two-stage stochastic programming framework. This allows for more realistic decision making by accounting for multiple possible futures with uncertain renewable generation, demand, and prices, rather than optimizing for a single expected scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give a general overview of PyPSA and showcase the new stochastic programming functionality by solving an energy system planning problem under uncertainty. It is suitable for both experienced PyPSA users and newcomers to energy system modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There is a vast ecosystem of open-source energy system modelling (ESM) tools. Hundreds of tools have been published to date, mostly originating from research organisations. However, few have gained enough traction to be considered by practitioners for infrastructure planning. If we are to make open-source the norm in decision making, we need to ensure it is possible to explore and compare the range of tools available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not been possible. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce the &lt;a href="https://openmod-tracker.org/"&gt;Open Energy Modelling Tool Tracker (openmod-tracker)&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that aggregates data on open ESM tool source code repositories and their development communities, created by &lt;a href="https://openenergytransition.org/"&gt;Open Energy Transition&lt;/a&gt; with support from &lt;a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/"&gt;Breakthrough Energy GRIDS&lt;/a&gt;. We will share insights drawn from repository activity and user engagement, highlighting which tools demonstrate the strongest momentum and why these should be the focus of collaborative development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complementing this, we present our &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-energy-transition/openmod-features"&gt;open-source tool feature platform&lt;/a&gt;, designed to help practitioners select tools and developers identify feature gaps. Our goal is to expand the platform’s coverage and refine its taxonomy with input from the wider community. We see FOSDEM as an opportunity to kick-start this collaboration and invite you to join us in shaping the future of open-source energy modelling.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>From Code to Models-as-Data: GEMS, a High-Level Language for Energy System Modelling</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Energy systems are undergoing rapid transformation as sector coupling intensifies and variable renewable generation grows, creating a pressing need for flexible and transparent modeling tools. While many open-source frameworks offer rich features, extending them with new mathematical models typically requires writing custom software—a barrier for many analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present GEMS (Generic Energy Systems Modelling Scheme), a  high-level modelling language designed to make multi-energy system adequacy and planning studies both more expressive and more accessible. GEMS brings model definitions out of the codebase and into simple YAML configuration files, where users describe variables, parameters, and constraints using natural mathematical expressions. These expressions are parsed into abstract syntax trees and automatically expanded—across time structures, scenario trees, and study data—into a complete optimization problem. This model-agnostic architecture enables rapid experimentation, lowers development and maintenance costs, and promotes true reusability: adding a new component requires no code, only data. The language is already supported in Antares Simulator and in the Python package GemsPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present how GEMS could paves the way for interoperability between modelling tools, offering a neutral and extensible modeling layer that can be shared across the open-source energy modeling ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Sustainable observability: how to reduce data bloat and carbon impact</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When choosing observability platforms, we rarely consider their carbon footprint. Yet every metric collected, every log retained, and every dashboard query consumes energy and at scale, the environmental impact becomes significant. 
This talk explores the principles and real-world advantages of green observability. We’ll examine how open source observability ecosystems are beginning to address carbon awareness and promote more efficient data practices. Through examples, I’ll show how teams can reduce ingestion volume, lower storage requirements, improve performance and enhance reliability through green coding practices.
By linking observability design choices to the Green Software Foundation’s principles, attendees will see how green observability supports a broader sustainable software strategy. They’ll also learn why sustainability in observability isn’t just an organizational obligation, it's a responsibility each engineer carries in the way we collect, store, and interpret data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Energy-Aware E-Paper Driving: Open Waveforms for Sustainable, Low-Power Displays</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="energy">Energy</track>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;E-Paper technology is often highlighted for its reflective readability and near-zero static power consumption, making it an attractive choice in a world where digital displays are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. From public transport signage to smart meters and IoT devices, the number of deployed displays continues to grow—and with it, the cumulative energy they consume. A sustainable future does not require removing or avoiding displays, but rather designing and driving them intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work with E-Paper displays, you will inevitably encounter a situation where the manufacturer provides only partially documented driver code—or, in many cases, a binary blob packed with initialization parameters and so-called waveform lookup tables (LUTs). Experimenting with these values often leads to unwanted side effects such as ghosting, low contrast, long-term image retention, or even permanently damaged panels. A solid understanding of the physics behind E-Paper driving is essential for safely modifying LUTs and optimizing them for lower active energy usage through improved waveform design and voltage-generation strategies.
In this talk, we break down the electrical and algorithmic principles that govern E-Paper operation and show how waveform LUTs influence update speed, ghosting behavior, image quality, and—critically—energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand why display energy matters in a world with rapidly increasing numbers of screens—and how E-Paper fits into a sustainable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the physical and algorithmic principles behind E-Paper waveform driving and how LUTs impact image quality, speed, ghosting, and energy use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover optimization techniques for lowering refresh energy through waveform tuning, voltage management, and timing control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See measurement-based comparisons showing how open, community-driven waveform development can outperform standard vendor LUTs in both quality and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bahn, with its 230,000 employees and hundreds of subsidiaries, is far from an average organization. Yet it faces the same challenges under the CRA as many others. In this session, we will show how we connected the concrete requirements of CRA compliance with our broader effort to bring transparency to our software supply chains. This forms the basis for security and license compliance processes, as well as for proactively shaping the ecosystems we depend on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will outline our strategy for addressing the expectations tied to the different roles we take on -- customer, manufacturer, and indirectly even steward -- from both organizational and technical angles. Given the diversity and scale of Deutsche Bahn, we rely on modular FOSS tools that offer the flexibility to adapt to varying stakeholder needs and evolving regulation.

        <title>CRA-by-Design: Protocol-Embedded Compliance for EV Charging Infrastructure</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EV charging stations expose a uniquely difficult CRA landscape: A single physical device can be accessed through very different user paths: ISO 15118 (Plug&amp;amp;Charge), RFID cards, mobile apps, credit-card terminals, and OEM-backends. Between the end user and the actual product manufacturer sit multiple intermediaries (CSMS, OEM cloud, roaming hubs, payment processors), each with partial control over configuration, telemetry, and security posture. How to deliver all the CRA obligations across this complex eco system? At the same time a typical Charging Station Operator (CPO) has to manage over 300 different manufactures, models, firmware images and cyber security might differ from monitored private charging stations up to high-power public charging stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather on relying on "out-of-band" CRA management, a better approach might be to integrate all CRA cyber security obligations and especially the vulnerability management deeply into the commonly used management protocols like the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP). This removes the disconnect between CRA compliance work and operational reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work in the Open Charge Alliance (notably the Cyber Security Task Group), CyberStand.eu’s CRA alignment efforts, and the newly NLnet NGI Zero Commons–funded &lt;strong&gt;EVQI&lt;/strong&gt; project is already pushing concrete interfaces in this direction: Device-model variables for CRA readiness, structured vulnerability and lifecycle metadata, cross-vendor health monitoring, and standardized audit-trail exports suitable for CRA Article 10-15 reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session outlines how CRA obligations can be realized in a heterogeneous, multi-vendor charging ecosystem with an emphasis on operators managing 50000+ of devices. It shows which processes must be automated, which artefacts need to be transported over OCPP, and how deep protocol-level integration enables consistent, scalable CRA compliance across an extremely diverse EV-charging landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp"&gt;Erlang/OTP&lt;/a&gt; is an open source programming language designed for the development of concurrent and distributed systems. Created 40 years ago and open sourced in 1998, Erlang is used by &lt;a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cisco.com/"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.com/"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.klarna.com/se/"&gt;Klarna&lt;/a&gt; for mission critical applications as well as loved by a broad community of open source developers. With the advent of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), the Erlang/OTP team, jointly with the &lt;a href="https://erlef.org/"&gt;Erlang Ecosystem Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (EEF), began to prepare the project to meet CRA requirements.
  
In this presentation, Kiko will describe and dive into the various supply chain best practices implemented by the Erlang/OTP project: the creation of Source Software Bill-of-Materials (Source SBOMs), automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies using &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/"&gt;OSV&lt;/a&gt;, creation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex/spec"&gt;OpenVEX statements&lt;/a&gt;, vulnerability handling in collaboration with the &lt;a href="https://cna.erlef.org/"&gt;EEF as CNA&lt;/a&gt;, and contributions to towards other open source projects [[1],[2],[3]] to improve the security posture of the ecosystem. Moreover, Kiko will provide an insight into the lessons learned from implementing these measures in an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>CRA Compliance in Embedded Systems: A Practical Look from the Yocto Project World</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Embedded products are at the core of the Cyber Resilience Act, yet they face unique compliance challenges. Hardware vendors ship heavily patched BSPs, software modules often diverge from upstream, and reliable identification of modified components is still far from solved. For teams building products on top of these layers, translating CRA requirements into daily engineering practice is not straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk provides a practical overview of where CRA compliance currently stands for embedded devices, using Yocto Project–based workflows as a representative example. We will explore what is already achievable today with existing tooling (SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, provenance capture), and highlight the gaps that still require industry-wide definitions - from consistent software identification to handling vendor modifications and long-tail dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will gain a grounded, realistic understanding of how CRA obligations map to actual embedded development, what can be implemented now, and where the ecosystem still needs collective work to reach a "working" state.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is reshaping expectations around open source software, introducing new requirements for security, traceability, and documentation. While maintainers are responsible for technical compliance, community managers play a critical but often overlooked role in helping projects adapt. This session is designed for community managers, project maintainers, stewards, and open source contributors interested in practical CRA readiness. The focus is on practical enablement by Community Managers, exploring how they can support compliance without assuming legal liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll show how Community Managers can:
- Communicate CRA-relevant processes to contributors, downstream adopters, and vendors
- Structure documentation, governance pages, and onboarding materials for clarity and discoverability
- Protect newcomers from unnecessary compliance burden, keeping contribution welcoming and accessible
- Support maintainers, triaging non-technical questions, coordinating workflows, and preventing burnout
Facilitate cross-project collaboration, shared tooling, and evidence collection practices
- Manage vulnerability communication to maintain trust and transparency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is for attendees to leave with practical strategies, templates, and examples that make CRA compliance manageable while keeping open source communities healthy and contributor-friendly. This session is ideal for community managers, project stewards, maintainers, and anyone interested in the human side of CRA readiness in FOSS projects. Attendees will leave with key takeaways:
- Understand CRA’s indirect impact on community management and a checklist of how tos
- Learn concrete ways to keep projects welcoming despite increased compliance expectations
- Explore templates and workflow ideas that reduce friction for contributors and maintainers alike
- See examples of cross-project coordination and documentation practices that support CRA readiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session emphasizes practical, community-driven solutions focusing on doing and not debating legal strategy making CRA compliance achievable and sustainable for FOSS communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This panel brings together experts to discuss the practical realities of implementing the CRA steward role, as defined by the regulation, and how organisations are approaching its execution. Panelists will explore how the concept of CRA stewards is being interpreted, what responsibilities are emerging in practice, and the challenges organisations face in preparing for this new function. They will also highlight which elements remain unclear, what support or guidance is still needed, and how future work at the level of EC and broader ecosystem can help refine and operationalise the steward role effectively. The panel aims to offer concrete insights for organisations navigating this evolving responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Security teams are currently drowning in vulnerability data, but the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) offers a solution by providing machine-readable clarity on which exploits actually matter. This technology is rapidly evolving from a "nice-to-have" efficiency tool into a critical compliance enabler for the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), which mandates effective vulnerability handling for the European market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Georg and Rao present the findings from the VEX Industry Collaboration Working Group, a group of industry leaders driving the development and application of VEX. The group identified a set of challenges and gaps hampering adoption, ranging from the different evolving technical directions in VEX formats to practical barriers such as discovery and distribution of VEX documents, immature tooling, and education. Rao and Georg will outline a shared path forward, advocating for the creation of a common distribution system, development of necessary tooling, and establishing a forum for collaboration between industry partners and open source projects to drive adoption and education.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) requires a risk-based approach when developing and supporting products, even those that are only software. The most important part of this is the cybersecurity risk assessment. This document is the main thing that decides which essential cybersecurity requirements you must follow for your product and which ones you don't need to implement. If you don't have this cybersecurity risk assessment, your product will be seen as not compliant in the EU market, no matter how good it is overall. You are in charge of creating this risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will learn the steps of this formal and documented process to set up a compliant and reliable way to manage cybersecurity risks for your products with digital elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will draw inspiration from standard industry practices for information security risk management and the recently released EN 40000-1-2 draft from the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start by defining the product's context and defining risk acceptance criteria. Then, we will move to the risk assessment itself. This involves finding and documenting the product's assets and objectives, identifying threats, estimating how big the risks are, and then evaluating the risks to process them further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close the risk management loop, we will discuss how to treat risks, how we need to communicate risks to our users and how to monitor and review those identified risks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Can security attestations deliver on their promise to simplify due diligence and strengthen open source sustainability?</title>

        <track slug="cra-in-practice">CRA in practice</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the EU Cyber Resilience Act is currently shaped by two flawed assumptions: that most open source projects have a steward, and that stewards are synonymous with foundations. Data from the JavaScript and Rust ecosystems shows the opposite—hundreds of thousands of widely used packages exist outside any stewardship structure, while foundations oversee only a tiny fraction. The CRA anticipated this reality and introduced a separate mechanism to help manufacturers meet due-diligence requirements: a security attestation program intended to function as an open-source analogue to CE marking. Done well, attestations can dramatically simplify compliance while improving security and sustainability across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current proposals, however, lean toward lightweight models that offer limited value to manufacturers and little support for the maintainers who produce the software those manufacturers rely on. This talk proposes a more effective middle path: an attestation approach that leverages maintainer expertise, delivers clear and actionable assurances to manufacturers, and creates sustainable revenue channels for projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the OpenJS Foundation’s Ecosystem Sustainability Program (ESP) as a concrete example, we will illustrate how project-approved commercial support, revenue sharing, and clear integration points can produce benefits for both manufacturers and maintainers. ESP demonstrates how a structured program can help fund essential security and maintenance work without requiring projects to become foundation-stewarded. By connecting these lessons to the CRA’s attestation framework, the session outlines what a truly useful attestation system could deliver: practical compliance for manufacturers, meaningful support for maintainers, and a healthier, more resilient open source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>CRA-ppy data: We need better open data for CRA compliance</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone's building CRA compliance tooling: SBOM generators, vulnerability scanners, security scorecards, automated due diligence checks. But, CRA readiness isn't just about tooling. It's about ensuring the data feeding those tools is actually accurate and trusted. The project activity, package metadata, licensing information, and vulnerability data these tools depend on is systematically unreliable, and we need to fix it at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk demonstrates why data accuracy is the blocking issue for practical CRA readiness. We'll show real-world examples from major package ecosystems: Python packages with wrong license declarations, Java JARs with embedded vulnerable dependencies that scanners miss, Rust crates with incomplete origin metadata. When demonstrating due diligence or attempting automated vulnerability reporting, the underlying data failures make compliance impossible, no matter how good your tools are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this is solvable, and the FOSS community is already working on it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll present concrete approaches being deployed across ecosystems: systematic metadata curation projects that scan and fix package data at scale, validation tooling that catches errors before publication, and community infrastructure that makes accurate software metadata freely available. You'll see how projects like Maven Heaven, T-Rust, and Nixpkgs Clarity are cleaning up metadata for the most popular packages, releasing curated data under open licenses, and providing author-facing tools to prevent bad data from entering registries. And we'll discuss how reliable project health data provides critical insights for proactive CRA due diligence and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session gives you practical next steps: how to audit data quality in your dependencies, contribute to metadata curation efforts, integrate validation into your publishing workflow, and leverage community-curated data for more reliable compliance automation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For FOSS maintainers, many of whom contribute voluntarily and without formal organizational backing, the CRA raises urgent questions: What exactly changes for my project? What responsibilities - if any - apply to me? And how can I prepare without being overwhelmed? This panel puts FOSS maintainers at the center of the conversation. Joined by industry practitioners for complementary perspectives, maintainers will discuss what the CRA means for day-to-day project work, long-term sustainability, and collaborative development practices. 
Key topics include:
Which CRA obligations might touch volunteer-driven FOSS projects - and which clearly do not
What are those tools you use right now or plan using to get closer to the CRA readiness and what you’re missing
How maintainers can proactively position their projects without needing formal compliance
How industry stakeholders can step up to support the FOSS components they rely on
Practical guidance on documentation, secure development practices, and project governance
How the CRA could catalyze a healthier relationship between FOSS communities and commercial users&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;People want to run Java workloads in Linux containers and they want that to
work well. Historically, Java has tended to prefer to manage things itself,
and without tuning, there have been challenges getting OpenJDK payloads to
excel alongside other workloads in container workloads.
But that has been changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give a high-level overview of the journey that OpenJDK has taken
to play nicely with others in a container context (Kubernetes or otherwise),
the current state-of-play, and where we might be going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No deep Java knowledge necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author works on OpenJDK and containers, both in the upstream OpenJDK
project and downstream, initially at Red Hat, and now at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reducing container images size with eBPF &amp; Podman</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reducing container image size improves security, speeds up cold starts, and cuts network transfer costs. Yet in development workflows, it’s easy to inherit bloated base images or copy templates full of unused tools. To build minimal, production-ready OCI images, we need visibility into what a container actually uses at runtime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a lightweight method for profiling file access inside containers using &lt;a href="https://docs.ebpf.io/"&gt;eBPF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://podman.io/"&gt;Podman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://specs.opencontainers.org/runtime-spec/runtime/#lifecycle"&gt;OCI lifecycle hooks&lt;/a&gt;. By leveraging the prestart hook, we can gain access to the container’s initial PID, allowing an eBPF program to trace all file opens. Tracepoint and LSM (Linux Security Module) eBPF programs are combined to capture the absolute path of each opened file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will show how this approach can allow us to distinguish required files from bloat, validate dependencies, and reduce container image size, resulting in smaller, faster, and more secure OCI images.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We usually think about successful open source in terms of user adoption, level of community contributions, or even vanity metrics like GitHub stars. But what if the success of many of the most popular open source projects in the cloud native ecosystem lies in the ability of external consumers to extend the project in ways the creators didn’t even envision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll look at the containerd project and its intentionally designed extensibility. These extensible capabilities have become key launching points for innovation created and even maintained outside of the core project. We’ll look at the details of our snapshotter and shim interfaces, two popular ways to extend containerd that have many examples after 10 years of project development. New features will be demonstrated that utilize these interfaces such as native macOS support that uses the brand new "nerdbox" shim and the erofs snapshotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll detail the concrete value provided by extensibility and invite other project creators and maintainers to consider how they are designing for extensibility to enable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reproducing a container image would ideally be just a matter of setting &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; in your build commands or containerfiles. Like most reproducible builds though, that’s just one part of the story. And unfortunately, the other part is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the rest of the sources of non-determinism (and yes, there are quite a few). The most critical part of the story is &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; that anyone can reproduce your container image &lt;em&gt;bit-for-bit&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of the date, location, device architecture, or container runtime they are using. Who’s doing this though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll explain why one should care about reproducible images, why are we reproducibly building &lt;code&gt;sha256:b0088ba0110c2acfe757eaf41967ac09fe16e96a8775b998577f86d90b3dbe53&lt;/code&gt; for about a year now, and how you can easily leverage some of the stuff we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Containers are everywhere, whether you run them locally for testing or on a production server, there is always a need to find its logs, metrics to know how much resources are being consumed and whether it is stable or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will demonstrate an example of how to monitor your Docker Containers using Prometheus and cAdvisor and view the metrics in Grafana to get better observability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an introduction Open Source tools, integration and also an excellent opportunity to learn more about the advanced features, including troubleshooting &amp;amp; debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;join us to learn more about Grafana, community contributions and share your feedback and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year we open sourced a Containerization framework and container CLI tooling to enable developers to create and run Linux container images directly on their Mac in a way that focuses on security and privacy.  In this talk, we'll dive into the Containerization framework, describing its foundational role in creating the container CLI which enables users to build, run and deploy Linux containers on Mac. We’ll walk through the architecture, highlight key APIs and discuss why we wrote it in Swift. We’ll then discuss some of our future roadmap for feature development and integration opportunities and challenges in the existing open source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade (or three) of container runtimes on Linux, the attacks against container runtimes with the most bang-for-your-buck have generally been filesystem related — often in the form of a confused-deputy style attack. This is aided in part by the sheer number of juicy targets accessible through filesystem APIs such as &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the past few years have seen quite a few security issues of this form in &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc"&gt;runc&lt;/a&gt; and other container runtimes — most recently in a set of CVEs published in November 2025 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2"&gt;CVE-2025-31133&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r"&gt;CVE-2025-52565&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm"&gt;CVE-2025-52881&lt;/a&gt;). However, this is far from a container-specific issue. Many Unix programs have historically suffered from similar issues, and the various attempts at resolving it have not really measured up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go through the myriad of issues necessary to protect user space programs against these kinds of attacks, completed and ongoing kernel work to try to make these problems easier to resolve, and our experience migrating a container runtime's codebase to a design which emphasises path-safety. In addition, this talk will also include an update on &lt;a href="https://github.com/cyphar/libpathrs"&gt;libpathrs&lt;/a&gt; (a library intended to make mitigating these attacks much easier for most Linux programs).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I run my 3D in Kubernetes, as-code and git versioned, and you can too! Say goodbye to your Raspberry Pets, lost configs, clunky updates, &lt;code&gt;apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt; breaking your setup, and always out-of-date backups. Say hi to everything is versioned and tracked in git, one &lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt; away from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session I will showcase &lt;a href="https://github.com/nadiamoe/kubeklipper/"&gt;kubeklipper&lt;/a&gt;, a helm chart to run &lt;a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/"&gt;Klipper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker"&gt;Moonraker&lt;/a&gt;, a web frontend (&lt;a href="https://docs.mainsail.xyz/"&gt;Mainsail&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://docs.fluidd.xyz/"&gt;Fluidd&lt;/a&gt;) and even a slicer all in your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2025 we rebuilt www.epfl.ch from the ground up: a fleet of 650 WordPresses, masquerading as one Web site. By applying Kubernetes and nginx (instead of Apache previously) to the best of their abilities, we achieved a 10-fold reduction of our footprint, from 20 Kubernetes pods to 2. Our contribution consists of two dozen plug-ins for WordPress, and extensive configuration-as-code including an OpenShift (OLM)-compatible WordPress operator. You can use it in whole or in part for your organization today, and we'll show you where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Starting Points&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-ops"&gt;wp-ops&lt;/a&gt;: the main thing, w/ Dockerfiles and Ansible configuration-as-code. In turn, these pull together a whole lot of open-source code, and a number of other GitHub repositories from below https://github.com/epfl-si , all open-source; including:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-theme-2018/"&gt;wp-theme-2018&lt;/a&gt;, showing the EPFL colors,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-menu-api"&gt;wp-menu-api&lt;/a&gt;, a Node microservice to stitch all menus together,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-operator"&gt;wp-operator&lt;/a&gt;, the OLM-conformant Kubernetes operator and Custom Resource Definition (CRD),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various WordPress plugins, some generic like &lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-plugin-pushgateway"&gt;wp-plugin-pushgateway&lt;/a&gt; to push your wp-cron results into Prometheus, some very specific like &lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-plugin-epfl-restauration"&gt;wp-plugin-epfl-restauration&lt;/a&gt; which shows what's for lunch today;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-veritas"&gt;wp-veritas&lt;/a&gt;, our backoffice GUI to create, update and delete WordPresses in the tree (written in Next.js);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and &lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si?q=wordpress&amp;amp;type=all&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;sort="&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/epfl-si/wp-dev"&gt;wp-dev&lt;/a&gt;: to get the whole shebang (or most of it) up and running on your workstation — ready for hacking, committing, forking, and contributing.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Nixpkgs Clarity: Correcting Nix package license metadata</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="nix-and-nixos">Nix and NixOS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nixpkgs is massive with the largest, most up-to-date collection of Nix packages, powering reproducible systems and forming the backbone of many projects. But there's a problem: Nix packages' license metadata is a mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nix's license tracking uses a custom license ID system that doesn't match the best practice of using SPDX license expressions standards, inconsistently referencing SPDX or ScanCode LicenseDB. The metadata often falls out of sync with the actual code or misrepresents what's really licensed, and packagers typically only check the top-level declared license and skip the file-level details where the real complexity hides. For an ecosystem built on correctness and reproducibility, this is a gap we need to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixpkgs Clarity fixes this with state-of-the-art automated license detection. We're correcting and standardizing license metadata across the entire Nixpkgs collection, aligning with SPDX best practices, and making sure what we declare actually matches what's in the code. This matters because accurate license data is critical for software supply chain security, CRA compliance, and anyone who needs to responsibly reuse Nixpkgs packages in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how we're detecting and correcting license metadata across Nixpkgs, and what changes when you finally have accurate license data. We'll share how we are tackling the unique challenges of Nixpkgs at scale, with tens of thousands of packages, Nix's functional approach to package definitions, and automated detection in a way that maintainers can trust and verify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care about making Nixpkgs even more reliable and supply chain ready, come see how we're bringing Nix's correctness principles to Nix packages' license metadata.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, IndieHosters has specialized in hosting and making accessible free software as a service, from blogs and forums to wikis and online collaboration tools, with a core mission to enable people and organizations to always keep control over their data and privacy in order to achieve data sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support this mission, we created libre.sh, a framework of tools that enables us to host free software at scale. It has evolved quite a bit since our initial talk at FOSDEM 2017. We progressively changed many of the tools and software we have been using, for instance, transitionning from Docker Compose to kubernetes. In more recent time, we are progressively using Nix and NixOS in various part of our work. In this talk, we wish to show what this change actually looks like in our processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a demonstration, we are gonna deploy an instance of LaSuite.coop, a fully-fledged application suite, starting from a fresh environment. Along the way we'll cover how our provisionning is done with nixos-anywhere and disko, how declarative Nix environments impacted our workflow, how we build reproducible container images using Nix, and more. Basically, if it uses Nix at IndieHosters, we will discuss it! We can't wait to discuss, share our experiences with the Nix community and receive valuable feedback from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Our digital lives are increasingly fragmented across numerous centralised online services. This model concentrates power, leaving us with minimal technical control over our personal data and online identities. The long-term permanence of these platforms is uncertain, and their commercial incentives are often misaligned with user interests. We propose inverting this model: instead of centralising our data in proprietary silos, let’s centralise our presence under our own control using open, federated services. We introduce the concept of ‘digital islands’, or Eileans – self-hosted hubs for an individual’s or community’s online presence. By hosting services ourselves, we regain autonomy and control. Eilean is a project designed to simplify the creation and management of these digital islands. The core idea is to parameterise a complete operating system deployment by a domain name and a desired set of services. This allows users to easily deploy their own instances of federated services like Matrix, Mastodon, and E-Mail. We utilise NixOS to enable declarative, reproducible configuration and deployment of these services. This provides strong guarantees about the system’s state.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With TAPPaaS we are building a small, composable private cloud for homes, communities and small organisations. It should feel like an enterprise‑grade packaged solution, but be built fully with FOSS and declarative Nix/NixOS tooling.
Our current design is a 2‑node cluster with a third backup node, using Proxmox as cluster manager, NixOS and flakes for all VMs running platform services. All changes go through GitOps workflows, and services are packaged as NixOS modules that share central identity, secrets, backup and monitoring. We will show the architecture, NixOS/Flake deployment structure and CI/CD pipeline, and how declarative configuration helps with upgrades, failures and restores.
This talk is for Nix/NixOS users and operators who want to turn homelab ideas into robust platforms for real organisations. We will share what works and where we struggle, and invite experienced nixers to challenge our choices and point us to patterns and tools we should adopt.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reproducibility remains one of the largest challenges in benchmarking distributed systems, especially when hardware, kernel settings, and dependency versions vary between tests. This talk presents a NixOS-based approach for constructing deterministic, portable benchmark environments for large-scale data infrastructure. We show how Nix’s declarative system configuration, content-addressed builds, and reproducible packaging model allow engineers to isolate performance variables and eliminate configuration drift entirely. Using Apache Cassandra as the primary case study, the talk demonstrates how NixOS can define and reproduce complete cluster environments—from OS images to JVM parameters and custom benchmarking tools—across both cloud and on-prem setups. Attendees will learn practical patterns for packaging workloads, pinning dependencies, and generating ephemeral benchmark nodes. The session concludes with a discussion of how Nix abstractions can support multi-architecture testing, including cross-compiling workloads for ARM and RISC targets, enabling more transparent and repeatable performance comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NixOS reproducibility monitoring has historically been limited to the ISO images we ship, because they are a package set small enough to be rebuilt on a single machine. In this talk, we introduce &lt;a href="https://github.com/nix-community/lila"&gt;LILA&lt;/a&gt;, a decentralized reproducibility monitoring infrastructure for the NixOS community, aimed at removing this limit and allowing a collaborative monitoring of the entirety of nixpkgs!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The OCaml language package manager, Opam, has support for interfacing with system package mangers to provide dependencies external to the language. Supporting Nix required re-thinking the abstractions used to interface with traditional package managers, but enables using Opam for development easy whilst benefitting from Nix's reproducible system dependencies. This provides one example of how Nix interfaces with other software development and deployment technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;All the big cloud providers provide your machines with a unique cryptographic identity that can be used to talk to their cloud services securely without having to manage or rotate any cryptographic secrets yourself. For example GCP has Service accounts and AWS has IAM roles. This ubiquity of cloud identity and the seamless integration with all the the services of these cloud providers is one of the reasons why they are so successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone) tries to unify these concepts of workload identity in a vendor neutral framework. But how do we bootstrap our cryptographic identity securely when we are running things on our own hardware as opposed to on cloud? What is our bottom turtle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how I use Nix OSin combination with the swiss-army knife of tools provided by systemd (ukify, systemd-measure, systemd-repart, systemd-veritysetup-generator) to create reproducible images for which we can predict TPM measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with a custom attestation plugin for SPIRE (the reference CA server for SPIFFE) that uses TPM remote attestation I can give each of my servers a unique identity encoded in a TLS certificate if and only if they were booted up with the software that I intended them to boot up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then allows me to have workloads talk to each other with mutual TLS without having to manage any keys or certificates myself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt the need for a virtual machine in your NixOS server environment? Maybe the functionality you want is not available in NixOS? Maybe there’s a custom OS image for a service you want to provide? Maybe you just want to securely isolate your workload? NixOS promises reproducible and declarative systems, but for VMs it just wasn’t there yet. To close this gap we built the &lt;code&gt;ctrl-os.vms&lt;/code&gt; NixOS module, a solution to define generic virtual machines directly in your NixOS configuration. It works just like &lt;code&gt;virtualisation.oci-containers&lt;/code&gt;, but for VMs instead of containers. 20 lines of Nix make it possible to run any Linux distribution you want as a VM on your NixOS host. To put a cherry on top you can use &lt;code&gt;cloud-init&lt;/code&gt;, from our NixOS configuration to configure your guests declaratively, too!
&lt;code&gt;ctrl-os.vms&lt;/code&gt; is part of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cyberus-ctrl-os/ctrl-os-modules"&gt;ctrl-os-modules&lt;/a&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I'll present my story of building a machine-readable inventory of computing equipment of my employer. It collects information such as: “&lt;em&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;computer&lt;/strong&gt; is located in this &lt;strong&gt;room&lt;/strong&gt; with this &lt;strong&gt;network configuration&lt;/strong&gt;, these &lt;strong&gt;software requirements&lt;/strong&gt; and is connected to this &lt;strong&gt;port&lt;/strong&gt; of this &lt;strong&gt;switch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” so that I can easily develop scripts that configure the machine, the switch, monitoring of both and many other things including a physical map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through many iterations of this project–codenamed &lt;em&gt;AR&lt;/em&gt;–and settled on NixOS modules for their balance between how easy it is to write new records and how easy it is to use them. Let me share the joy it brought to my job and present curated code snippets so you can build your own inventory with ease.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nix and Nixpkgs are gaining ever-broader adoption at the same time that SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials) are emerging as a standard format for demonstrating provenance. This talk will argue that bridging the gap is imperative for the Nix ecosystem, illustrate a fleshed-out approach to SBOM generation. This will suggest some improvements to Nixpkgs that I believe could unlock further progress.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/xlambein/nixss"&gt;Nixss&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced "nix" like you're a snake) is a Nix library for making static sites. It's not a static site generator, rather, it provides tools to build your own. Nixss comes with several pre-processors and combinators that will turn whatever files you throw at it into a tree of Nix derivations, which builds into a static site. It also has its own Nix-based templating system, if you'd rather not use more conventional ones.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NixOS, with its ability to centrally manage multiple devices, is an ideal way to maintain a network infrastructure that consists of multiple devices (routers, switches, access points). This presentation will provide an overview of how NixOS can be utilized on routers. This will include configuration based on systemd-networkd for routing and switching, as well as hostapd for Wi-Fi. It aims to provide you with tips on setting up your network infrastructure on NixOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;

A plugin for the &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; documentation generator that takes your Nix code, and generates documentation for NixOS options, Nix packages, and Nix functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how to setup Sphinx and &lt;code&gt;sphinxcontrib-nixdomain&lt;/code&gt; for your project, how to generate documentation for Nix objects, and how to add cross-references to those Nix objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also go into some documentation architecture best practices and personal advice, to hopefully make your documentation easy to use, browse, and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://minijackson.github.io/sphinxcontrib-nixdomain/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sphinxcontrib-nixdomain&lt;/code&gt; documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Nix-manipulator: Python library to manipulate Nix code with ease</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="nix-and-nixos">Nix and NixOS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hoh/nix-manipulator"&gt;Nima&lt;/a&gt;, the Nix Manipulator, is a new Python library and collection of tools for &lt;strong&gt;parsing, manipulating and reconstructing&lt;/strong&gt; Nix source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will introduce the project, its original goals, key features, and practical applications. It will explore the tradeoffs and decisions made during development and demonstrate how to use its various features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started during &lt;a href="https://saltsprint.org/"&gt;SaltSprint&lt;/a&gt; 2025, Nima aims to fill the absence of tools for easily updating and editing Nix code. Popular tools such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-update"&gt;nix-update&lt;/a&gt; rely on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-update/blob/fbb35af0ed032ab634c7ef9018320d2370ecfeb1/nix_update/update.py#L26"&gt;simple string replacement&lt;/a&gt; or regular expressions for updating Nix code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-level abstractions make manipulating expressions easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserving formatting and comments in code that respects RFC-166.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eccentric formatting that does not respect RFC-166 and would add unnecessary complexity may not be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeted applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating values in Nix code by hand, scripts, pipelines, and frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing refactoring tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive modifications from a REPL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Foundations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nima builds on &lt;strong&gt;tree‑sitter&lt;/strong&gt;, a multilingual concrete‑syntax AST, with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nix-community/tree-sitter-nix"&gt;tree‑sitter‑nix&lt;/a&gt; grammar providing lossless parsing of Nix files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Project status&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is still in &lt;strong&gt;early‑stage&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Nix syntax is supported, but not all everything yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test-driven approach prevents regressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLI and API stability is still evolving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nix Forge is an attempt to lower the barrier and learning curve required for
packaging and deploying software with Nix, enforce best practices and unlock the
superpowers of Nix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a human-readable packaging recipe format (inspired by conda-forge),
Nix Forge abstracts away the need for advanced Nix packaging knowledge and
experience without sacrificing its powers. Users can define packages and
multi-component applications running in shell environments, containers, or
inside a NixOS system using simple declarative configurations instead of
writing Nix expressions. The NixOS-style module system guides users through
the packaging process, enforces best practices, and provides type checking
for recipes—ensuring quality and correctness from the start. On the other
hand, the web user interface provides an attractive catalog of packages and
applications with copy-paste instructions for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will demonstrate how this approach significantly benefits
developers in the era of LLMs. With its simplified, structured format, LLMs can
now effectively help users create and modify Nix packages—a task that previously
required deep Nix expertise. The human-readable recipes allow developers
to easily verify LLM-generated configurations, while built-in type checking
enforces correctness automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk details our personal journey of creating a setup for video streaming at conferences, called &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenFest/mixos"&gt;mixos&lt;/a&gt;. We explain the challenges we faced and how Nix and NixOS helped us get the work done in a robust and efficient way. We do not consider ourselves extremely proficient in Nix, so any feedback from the community would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we (as part of the FOSDEM video team) demonstrate how the same Nix-based setup can run on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/fosdem/video"&gt;FOSDEM video box&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Debugging Nix can be frustrating: poor error reporting, non-incremental builds, and cryptic stack traces make fixing a derivation a pain. This talk presents practical tools and techniques to make working with Nix expressions and builds more fun. A significant portion of this talk is a live coding demo, targeted at somewhat beginner-intermediate Nix users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Discover how PEP 810's explicit lazy imports can dramatically improve Python application startup times. Using a real CLI tool as a case study, that we totally use in our real business, this talk demonstrates practical techniques to optimize import performance while maintaining code clarity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The GIL and API Performance: Past, Present, and Free-Threaded Future</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Python’s Global Interpreter Lock has shaped the way developers build concurrent applications for nearly three decades. While the GIL simplified the CPython ecosystem, it also imposed well-known limits on CPU-bound work and multithreaded scalability. With the introduction of free-threaded Python (3.14t), that is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the history and purpose of the GIL, why it existed for so long, and the innovations that finally made its removal viable. We’ll look at how free-threading affects real workloads through concrete benchmarks. We'll investigate the often overlooked effect of freethreading on webservers. You’ll see how modern servers like Granian, ASGI frameworks, and WSGI stacks behave when threads are no longer serialized by the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end, you’ll understand not only what the GIL is, but what its disappearance means for scaling Python applications in production. Whether you're building high-throughput APIs, tuning async code, or planning future architecture, free-threaded Python opens the door to new performance ceilings - along with new tradeoffs every developer should know.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Modern Python monorepo with `uv`, `workspaces`, `prek` and shared libraries</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache Airflow is the most popular Data Workflow Orchestrator - developed under the Apache Software Foundation umbrella. We have 120+ Python distributions in our rep, and we often release ~ 100 of them every two week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those distributions are built from a single monorepo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[jarekpotiuk:~/code/airflow]  find . -name 'pyproject.toml' | wc
     120     120    4248&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had always posed a lot of challenges and we had a lot of tooling to make it possible, however with the recent development of Python Packaging tools, multipel Packaging PEPs implemented, and with new wave of tools such as &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prek&lt;/code&gt;, our setup is finally manageable and we removed 1000s of line of custom code we wrote before after we applied &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; workspaces, switched to &lt;code&gt;prek&lt;/code&gt;, started using inline script metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a breeze to have monorepo now. This talk explains how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus content. If you know the differences between dynamically and statically linked libraries in C and other languages, or used NPM - you might recognise the need of being able to use different versions of the same library in the same system. It's not possible in Python. Or is it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've figured out a way to eat cake and have it too - and we have "statically linked" libraries in Python. How did we do it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find out how from the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>PyInfra: Because Your Infrastructure Deserves Real Code in Python, Not YAML Soup</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="python">Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Remember when we said "Infrastructure as Code"? Somehow, the industry heard "Infrastructure as YAML" and ran with it. Now we're drowning in a sea of indentation-sensitive, template-riddled, Jinja2-abused configuration files that make even the most battle-hardened sysadmins weep into their mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;strong&gt;PyInfra&lt;/strong&gt;—where your infrastructure is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; code. Real Python. With loops that don’t require learning a DSL. With functions that are... wait for it... actual functions. With error handling that doesn’t involve praying to the YAML gods and sacrificing a virgin bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you’ll see how to:
- Write infrastructure automation that your IDE actually understands
- Debug with real stack traces instead of &lt;code&gt;"ERROR: The task includes an option with an undefined variable"&lt;/code&gt;
- Use actual Python conditionals instead of &lt;code&gt;when: ansible_os_family == "Debian" and not (ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" and ansible_distribution_version is version('20.04', '&amp;gt;='))&lt;/code&gt;
- Import and reuse code like a civilized developer, not copy-paste playbooks like it’s 1999
- Test your infrastructure code with &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;"let’s run it in staging and see what breaks"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll explore how a typical Ansible playbook can be transformed into clean, maintainable Python with PyInfra, shrinking from 500 lines of YAML to 50 lines of readable code. You’ll discover the joy of list comprehensions over &lt;code&gt;with_items&lt;/code&gt;, and the power of deployment logic that can actually &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop treating your infrastructure like a configuration file. It’s 2026—your servers deserve better than YAML. They deserve Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This talk may cause uncontrollable urges to refactor all your Ansible playbooks. Side effects include increased productivity, better sleep, and colleagues actually understanding your infrastructure code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Ducks to the rescue - ETL using Python and DuckDB</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="python">Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETL stands for "extract, transform, load" and is a synonym for moving data around. This has traditionally often required managing complex systems in the cloud or large data centers. The talk will demonstrate how all this can be greatly simplified by applying modern tools for the task: Python and DuckDB, both open source and readily available to run on most systems - even your notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Description:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ETL&lt;/strong&gt; stands for "extract, transform, load" and is a synonym for moving data from one system to another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, ETL was done in exactly that order: first you extract the data you want to process, then you transform it and then you load it into the target system. More modern approaches based on data lakes, swap the T and L, since transformation is more efficiently done in a database system, especially when it comes to large volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make all this work, the usual approach is to have a workflow system, taking care of managing all the intermediate steps, a large data lake database and distributed storage systems. This results in lots of complexity, need for system/cluster administration and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with today's computers, most data sizes used in ETL no longer need all this complexity. Even notebooks or single VMs can handle the load, when used with external object storage, so all you really just need is the right software stack to manage your ETL - without all the overhead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; has grown to be the number one programming language on the planet and is especially well suited for integration work due to its many readily available connectors to plenty of backend systems. It often comes preinstalled on Linux machines and is easy to install on most other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DuckDB&lt;/strong&gt; has emerged as one of the most capable embedded OLAP database systems and supports data lakes with the DuckLake extension, right out of the box. Installation is just a &lt;code&gt;uv add duckdb&lt;/code&gt; away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both can be run on the same machine and are very resource friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give an overview of the typical steps involved in ETL processes, give a short intro to DuckDB and showcase how DuckDB can be put to good use when implementing ETL processes. If time permits, I can also cover a few advanced topics addressing optimization strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resources:&lt;/em&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;'s built-in admin is powerful, but it's essentially a separate framework within Django and it's 20 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be nice to be able to work with an admin interface that works like the rest of Django, built on generic CBVs, plugins, and view factories? &lt;a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-admin2"&gt;Django-Admin2&lt;/a&gt;, was an attempt at doing just that and it was a fairly successful ptoject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 years later, after looking at reviving that project, I realized we needed a fresh approach: Meet &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/emmaDelescolle/django-admin-deux"&gt;Django-Admin-Deux&lt;/a&gt;: a proof-of-concept Django admin replacement where CRUD operations are just actions, knowledge transfers both ways, and everything feels like Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at what python features and architecture makes this possible&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Building a sovereign digital workplace with the help of Python, an example of the french administration</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The French digital agency (DINUM) has undertaken to develop an open-source collaborative digital workplace to make the work of public servants simpler and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collaborative digital workplace is distributed under an open-source license to allow anyone who wishes to take its applications and integrate them into their preferred tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By participating in existing open-source communities, the digital workplace enables the emergence of digital commons that facilitate independence for those who wish to deploy and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed with a modular approach, it can be partially or progressively adopted or complement an existing offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose to present two applications, both technically and functionally, that are integrated into this collaborative suite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative editing and documentation: The Suite &lt;a href="https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs"&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;, based on Prosemirror and Blocknotejs. Developed jointly with Germany and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File sharing: &lt;a href="https://github.com/suitenumerique/drive"&gt;Drive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These applications share the same technical stack, which relies on Python and the Django framework, Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond a list of libraries used, I will present the quality processes we have implemented, the complete workflow from the idea of a new feature to its implementation and deployment. I will share our dev handbook (also under an open-source license) that compiles our best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How what could be qualified as a "Boring Stack" (meaning proven and battle-tested) allows us to focus on solving complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Robot Vacuums are a pretty common item in many households around the world. They've also become a fairly standard item for robot hobbyists to hack on and use as cheap, open platforms for experiments in mobile bases. The classic "Turtlebot" platform has seen many incarnations, as the iRobot Create series, the Kobuki base, the Neato BotVac and now lives on in the "Hackerbot" from HackerBot Industries(https://www.hackerbot.co/). It has an open command set, options for an arm, animated head and SDK to support the development of character-like human-robot interactions. It does autonomous mapping of whatever space it was in at the push of a button. Unfortunately, the map is stored in an internal proprietary format, accessible through an app you download onto your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of robots at home and in my lab, all of which run ROS. Surely there must be some way to hack out the map and convert it into a ROS-compatible format that my other robots could use!
My talk would be discussing the steps I took to make this happen, the FOSS packages I used and the resulting tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not my first excursion into hacking robot mapping and sensors, so I'll also present some tips and tricks I've learned over the years to make seemingly proprietary robot subsystems more open and generally usable.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When building a robot you want to make sure your set up is perfect. This means good calibration for your sensors, good configurations for your sensors, good synchronization between sensors, good data logging practices and much much more! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk Roland and Sam will talk about their experiences with poorly configured robots, the importance of visualisation and the (open source) tools they use to solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As robotics systems grow more complex, bringing together all types of specialties from algorithm/ML developers, control engineers, to safety engineers, has become increasingly painful, especially when working with large, brittle stacks like C++ and ROS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares the journey of building Copper-rs, a Rust first robot runtime to make robotics development simpler, safer, and more predictable. Rust’s mix of performance, memory safety, and fearless concurrency offers a foundation for systems that don’t collapse under their own complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built entirely in the open, Copper-rs has grown out of the Rust for Robotics community and explores how we can take the openness and collaboration that made ROS successful and bring those values into a new generation of deterministic, Rust-based robotics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copper-rs project is an Apache v2 project available at https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ROS 2  is tied to specific Ubuntu versions, which limits platform choice and can introduce additional configuration complexity. In this talk, I will explain how to run ROS 2 on non-standard platforms using Apptainer, a practical alternative to Docker. I explain why Apptainer works well for robotics: it enables easy access to USB and serial devices, supports GPUs, and runs GUI programs like rviz without configuration. The talk ends with a short look at when the package manager Pixi might even let you avoid containers altogether. Being less tied to a specific Ubuntu release makes robot development more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Just1 is an open-source robotics platform built for learning and rapid experimentation. It supports manual and autonomous navigation, path following, and obstacle avoidance. With a bill of materials around $250, it offers an affordable way to explore robotics, ROS 2, and autonomous behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware includes a Raspberry Pi 4, mecanum wheels, TT motors, a 2D LiDAR, Raspberry Pi camera, and an IMU. The software stack is based on ROS 2 Jazzy, with RTAB-Map for SLAM, Nav2, and Foxglove integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created Just1 as a simple, low-cost platform to experiment and to share with the community. Upcoming work focuses on simulation support (Gazebo / NVIDIA Isaac).&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The learning curve for ROS2 can be steep, often requiring the installation and resolution of diverse software dependencies across operating systems, sensors, network configurations and robotic platforms. By combining virtual machines (VMs), with their off-the-shelf, ready-to-use environments resources and modern container registry workflows, we can reduce this complexity and enables learners to focus more directly on developing ROS2 skills. This approach also offers a smoother onboarding process for participants with varying levels of technical experience. In this talk, we share hands-on insights from our hackathon, which explored a distributed setup involving two servers located in different University College London (UCL) departments --Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE)-- connected via a Zero Overhead Network Protocol (Zenoh) router with 10 GbE connectivity. One server from CEGE was connected to physical sensors --laser scanners, Inertial Measurement Units, and cameras-- with data streamed through the ROSBridge suite and Zenoh. On the ARC server and platforms (unified-AI and condenser), participants worked with off-the-shelf VMs and within containerised environments running ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04. Five to ten participants accessed live sensor data via the ROSBridge Suite to visualise streams, perform object recognition and segmentation, and analyse outputs. They experimented with network constraints by varying sample rates, data types, and file sizes, and explored the trade-off between CPU usage for core ROS 2 packages and GPU demands for intensive tasks. Lessons on containerisation for virtual machines, managing dependencies, understanding latency and bandwidth, balancing resources, and cost considerations were shared, alongside next steps and a call for collaboration to advance ROS 2 skills and infrastructure in academia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the link to our hackathon for further details, the discussion forum, and ways to get involved: https://github.com/UCL-CyberPhysicalSystems/hackathon-01&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building localization and navigation systems requires a lot of time, effort and statistical analysis over multiple scenarios. There are multiple sparse tools out there to create specific KPIs around datasets but almost none that provide end to end integration test scenarios, KPIs and automatic report generation for localization systems.
Last year, at FOSDEM, we presented beluga - https://github.com/Ekumen-OS/beluga - a Monte Carlo Localization Framework for robotics. This year, we would like to present one of the tools we built for this project, Lambkin, the Localization and Mapping BenchmarKINg system that allows to orchestrate test runs of your code, data, KPIs and report generation all in one platform.
You can find the code here: https://github.com/Ekumen-OS/lambkin&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ROS2’s interface generation can be a major bottleneck in the build process, especially for large projects. The rosidl toolchain, while reliable, is slow due to its Python-based code generation and inefficient use of CPU resources.
rosidlcpp (https://github.com/TonyWelte/rosidlcpp) tackles these challenges by reimplementing the rosidl generators in C++. However, switching to C++ is only one of the ways rosidlcpp achieves faster builds. This talk will walk through the optimization journey behind rosidlcpp. We’ll cover how the build inefficiencies were diagnosed and the techniques used to address them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;More than two decades have passed since the first steps of the Gazebo simulator, one of the early attempts to provide a fully-featured 3D environment for robotics simulation. Rewritten into modular libraries, the new Gazebo preserved most of the internals from the previous era even if new features have been added continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meantime, especially in the last 5 years, the field of robotics simulation has experienced a rapid transformation. A new generation of simulators has emerged (Isaac Sim, O3DE, Carla, etc.) showing powerful rendering capabilities and advanced physics engines, supported by GPU acceleration to enhance realism and performance. These developments have not only changed the landscape of simulation, but have also created new opportunities for integrating AI, machine learning, and robotics in more complex and scalable virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any plans to push Gazebo into the modern features? The talk will provide information directly from one of the members of the Gazebo core team about existing roadmaps, funded projects, proof of concepts and any internal discussions on what could come for Gazebo in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rust offers many advantages for robotics. One key benefit is its memory safety, which helps prevent critical bugs in complex systems. Additionally, its high performance is essential for real-time applications, while safe concurrency allows for efficient parallel processing, crucial for multi-core robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present rclrs (https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust), the Rust client library for ROS 2, and its accompanying tooling. rclrs is being developed in the open by a community of Rust and ROS enthusiasts. Support for Rust is now part of ROS 2 rolling and will be shipped in the next ROS 2 releases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will discuss the open hardware and open-source software available today for creating open-source robots, taking the Upkie wheeled bipeds as our working example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project page: https://hackaday.io/project/185729-upkie-wheeled-biped-robots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robot software: https://github.com/upkie/upkie/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robot hardware: https://github.com/upkie/upkie_parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the software side, we will go through the core robotics libraries used by the robots: Gymnasium, moteus, and PyBullet, as well as libraries for developing robot behaviors, such as Stable-Baselines3 for reinforcement learning and qpmpc for model predictive control. We will compare model-based and AI-driven approaches to implement new behaviors on Upkies, discussing what has worked and not worked so far, as well as future plans for the project like integrating vision for perceptive locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, we will describe how Upkies use mjbots actuators and PCB cards, which are fully open source (down to motor-driver firmware and KiCad electronics files!). Upkies can be built from off-the-shelf components for around $3,000, making experimentation with bipedal robots more accessible to hobbyists and educators. We will finally conclude by releasing version 2 of the robot hardware with an on-stage demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building robots, whether industrial arms or autonomous vehicles, often comes with middleware pain that drains valuable engineering time. Issues like communication delays, execution inconsistencies, poor scalability, and nondeterministic behavior are common and frustrating. Most developers want to focus on their application, not on becoming middleware experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces &lt;a href="https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2"&gt;iceoryx2&lt;/a&gt;, the next generation of the widely used zero-copy middleware Eclipse iceoryx. It is written in Rust, with additional bindings for C, C++, Python, and C#, and runs on a variety of operating systems. iceoryx2 is already used in robotics, automotive, medical, finance, and other domains where high-throughput and low-latency communication are critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through common middleware pain points in robotic systems and show how iceoryx2’s architecture and feature set help eliminate or significantly reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many ROS developers know PX4 exists but never get the chance to actually poke at it. This talk gives you that chance. We walk through a complete precision landing pipeline using PX4, ROS 2, OpenCV, Aruco markers, and Gazebo, built the same way we teach it in our hands on workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the pieces of the PX4 architecture that matter to you as a ROS developer, then show how the PX4 ROS 2 interface works, including the PX4 ROS 2 Library by Auterion that makes message handling feel familiar instead of foreign. From there we jump into simulation with Gazebo, run OpenCV based Aruco detection, and wire it all into a precision landing controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the session is practical. We take the tag pose produced by OpenCV in the camera optical frame, transform it into the body frame and world frame, and use it to run an approach phase with PI velocity control. We cover the spiral search pattern for when the tag is not visible, and the land detection feedback that lets the system finish the job safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easy to try everything at home, we will provide a Docker container and an open repository with all the source code and configuration you need to reproduce the pipeline on your own machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever thought about connecting your ROS and OpenCV skills to PX4 but did not know where to start, this talk will get you there with a smile and a working example you can take home.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to build your own robot but felt overwhelmed by the complexity of dependencies, compilers, and unstable C++ code? Then why not use Rust? In this talk, we aim to convince you that ROS 2-Rust allows the creation of a state-of-the-art stack that is simple, safe, robust, memory-safe, and highly-performant, drastically reducing the time spent debugging runtime crashes. We will also show how to take advantage of Cargo, the Rust package manager, to ease dependency management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to demonstrate our postulate, we have open-sourced a repository that allows everyone to create a minimal, teleoperable rover from scratch. This shows how ROS 2-Rust can further reduce the barrier to entry in the world of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project also displays how we used Pixi to simplify the entire development workflow, allowing any developer to clone our open-source repository and achieve a fully working, cross-platform ROS 2 and Rust environment with just a single Pixi install command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us to see how this modern toolchain transforms complex robotics projects into an accessible and enjoyable open-source experience. We aim to inspire you to start your own rover project and show that building your first robot is now as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Simulation has evolved to be a key part of robotics development. Nevertheless, existing simulators such as Gazebo and O3DE tend to be time consuming to set up, computationally heavy and out of the box often simulate systems too idealistically, leading to systems that work in simulation but fail in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new ROS 2 package &lt;code&gt;vehicle_dynamics_sim&lt;/code&gt; aims to resolve this situation for the specific case of mobile platforms by providing an easy to configure and lightweight vehicle dynamics simulator focused on realistic actuator dynamics. It by default simulates real world imperfections such as dead time and acceleration limits, comes with six vehicle types (four bicycle/Ackermann + differential + omni/mecanum) and is fully configured through a minimum of ROS parameters. The two main use cases are trajectory following controller development and automated validation (CI).&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ros.org/"&gt;ROS&lt;/a&gt; is a popular and widely used middleware, ecosystem, and environment for robotics development. It's become quite popular in research environments and for early prototyping, but it's not as common to see it in production environments. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll go over my experience productionising ROS in professional settings, what gaps ROS has, and how you all can avoid the pitfalls, issues, and hellholes I've dug myself into multiple times through my career. This will include ROS message serialisation and how to mesh it with other serialisation formats, how you can leverage &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/"&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt; to generate real ROS build artifacts with &lt;a href="https://github.com/mvukov/rules_ros2"&gt;rules_ros2&lt;/a&gt;, and how to integrate all the above into a real robot in production with OTA updates.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ArduPilot is a trusted, versatile, and open source autopilot system supporting many vehicle types: multi-copters, traditional helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, boats, submarines, rovers and more. The source code is developed by a large community of professionals and enthusiasts. https://ardupilot.org/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArduPilot is a well known autopilot for drones but it is often associated to only hobby or academic work.
This talk will showcase some advanced features and integration of ArduPilot. The talk will present for each type of vehicle some interesting less known features and provide focused explanation on dual autopilot (or more) and advanced video feed usage with BlueOS (https://bluerobotics.com/what-is-blueos/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give idea how far people can integrate and what crazy idea are possible with ArduPilot from hobbyist to industrial grade, all staying FOSS and documented, of course !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't speak about rockets nor GPS denied things.
If time permits FROST quantum interoperability will be detailed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What if you could build an autonomous, outdoor collaborative robot using free, open-source tools and community-driven software? That’s exactly what we did at Botronics. In this talk, we will take you behind the scenes of iXi, our autonomous golf trolley, showing how we use open-source technologies, from high level behaviors and control to simulation, fleet management, monitoring, and user interfaces, to build a real-world robotic system deployed outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see how tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, Nav2, BalenaOS, Docker, Telegraf, Grafana, Rviz2, and React/React Native come together into a production stack to deploy one of the first outdoor collaborative robots. More than just engineering talk, the objective is to provide a return of experience and lessons learned about what open-source robotics can enable outside the lab: reproducible development, remote deployment, full observability, and real user-facing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in taking robotics beyond prototypes, building autonomous systems that work in the real world, this session will show you what’s possible using open source stacks from end to end.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ROS 2 was designed to be independent of its underlying communication middleware — a powerful architectural feature, but one that introduces complexity and overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on rmw_zenoh, we kept wondering: What if we streamlined the ROS 2 layers and built a Rust-native stack from Zenoh up to the RCL API? Could it improve performance? Would it be easier to extend? And could we still support existing RCL-C/C++/Python packages through C bindings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led us to develop ROS-Z, a Rust/Zenoh-native RCL stack, fully interoperable with ROS 2 via rmw_zenoh. In this talk, we’ll explore our design choices, share performance insights, and highlight the some of the unique features we’ve added to push innovation even further.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EasyNav is a fully open-source navigation framework for robots, designed to be lightweight, modular, and suitable for real-time execution. The project is motivated by the limitations of existing systems, which are tightly coupled to a single environment representation and often introduce unnecessary computational overhead. EasyNav decouples navigation from the underlying map structure, enabling costmaps, gridmaps, NavMap, or other models to be used interchangeably. Its architecture is built around a minimal core and open, extensible stacks that group controllers, planners, localizers, and map managers. The framework is designed to be easy to inspect, modify, and extend through its clear plugin interfaces. This talk will present the motivation, architecture, main features, and evaluation results in simulation and real robots, showing how an open-source approach improves flexibility, transparency, and performance in complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AutoAPMS: Lightweight and versatile integration of behavior trees into the ROS 2 ecosystem</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/autoapms/auto-apms"&gt;AutoAPMS&lt;/a&gt; is a heavily extensible development framework for behavior-based ROS 2 applications. It provides a highly modular integration of behavior trees, implements a powerful execution engine and offers convenient CLI tooling for deploying behaviors with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intention of this project is to make it significantly more user-friendly and less error prone to develop autonomous robotics with behavior trees. The core packages are written in C++ and a supplementary Python API exposes high-level features for scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework relies on the popular BehaviorTree.CPP library under the hood and offers a Nav2-agnostic approach for using it within the ROS 2 ecosystem. It was inspired by BehaviorTree.ROS2 and can be considered a spiritual successor. AutoAPMS took the core ideas of the behavior tree paradigm and supercharged it with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated resource management using &lt;code&gt;ament_cmake&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ament_index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modular design for multi-package workspaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible and highly configurable behavior execution engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful C++ behavior tree builder API (a supplement to BehaviorTree.CPP for enabling automated planning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy addition of custom behavior tree nodes with almost no boilerplate code required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for custom behavior definitions and tree builder algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ros2cli&lt;/code&gt; extension for working with the system directly from the command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User guide and API documentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PlotJuggler is an open source QT/C++ application that allow developers to visuale and analyze timeseries from logs, that it is very popular in the robotics and drones community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It supports both static files and real-time streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its plugin-based architecture makes it easy to extend; this allowed people to add more and more formats, in terms of streaming transport (Websocked, MQTT, ZeroMQ, UDP, ROS2, etc.), serialization protocols (DDS, Protobuf, JSON, Proprietary) and file formats (rosbags, PX4 logs, CSV, Arrow Parquet, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it includes a Lua-based data editor that allows the user to manipulate and transform data, effectively replacing the need for those "short-lived" Python scripts that people in this community would create to quickly analyze their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Github repository (https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler) is approaching its 10th anniversary, with 5.5K stars, 2500+ commits and 120+ contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session, four seasoned database administrators with sound knowledge of both PostgreSQL and MySQL present an unbiased comparison of the two technologies. Attendees will learn about the architectural and DX differences between the world's two most popular databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pep Pla, with his peculiar sense of humour, will open the session with a deep dive into the MVCC architectures between the two. The audience will learn why we need MVCC. Postgres and MySQL take very different approaches to implementation: Postgres relies on row versioning and vacuuming dead tuples, while MySQL does in-place changes and tracks versions with the undo log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broad-strokes overview from Ben Dicken, who has worked closely with both, will emphasize where ecosystem cross-pollination would help. This includes differences in table storage, bloat management, replication, and process-per-connection vs thread-per-connection architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres and MySQL take fundamentally different approaches to logical replication. Rohit Nayak and Shlomi Noach will examine how these designs affect WAL/binlog retention, backpressure, and CDC workloads, explore their failover implications, and highlight key feature-parity gaps between the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>"Drop-in Replacement": Defining Compatibility for Postgres and MySQL Derivatives</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The success of open source databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB has created an ecosystem of derivatives claiming "drop-in compatibility." But as the distance between upstream and these derivatives grows, user confusion and brand dilution can follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, we explore the challenge of compatibility with de facto standards from two distinct angles: a governance perspective on defining the compatibility criteria, and a systems engineering case study on implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Standard:&lt;/strong&gt; We present the findings from the &lt;a href="https://2025.pgconf.eu/community-events/establishing-the-postgresql-standard-whats-postgres-compatible/"&gt;"Establishing the PostgreSQL Standard"&lt;/a&gt; working group held at PGConf.EU 2025. This progress report details the community's consensus on the hard requirements needed to fix the "wild west" of marketing claims, including:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core SQL: Defining the non-negotiable functions, types, and PL/pgSQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocol: Why wire compatibility is insufficient without consistent transactional and &lt;code&gt;pg_catalog&lt;/code&gt; behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecosystem: The critical requirements for integration with logical replication and tools like Patroni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Implementation:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining compatibility with MySQL/MariaDB in &lt;a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb"&gt;TiDB&lt;/a&gt;, a distributed database engine, is far more complex than matching syntax for an evolving SQL dialect:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We explore the architectural friction of making TiDB speak the MySQL wire protocol and support the MySQL syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We cover compatibility with the MySQL binary log based replication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Jack of all trades: query federation in modern OLAP databases</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As analytics ecosystems grow more diverse, organisations increasingly need to query data across warehouses, data lakes, and operational systems without excessive movement or duplication. Query federation has become essential by enabling unified SQL access and intelligent pushdown into heterogeneous sources. This talk introduces the core principles of federation and why it matters for modern OLAP workloads and how it is different to Trino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using StarRocks as a model system, we highlight its vectorized execution engine, native connectors, and deep Apache Iceberg integration that together deliver high-performance lakehouse querying. We examine common lakehouse challenges—schema evolution, file fragmentation, and object-storage latency—and show how federation and hot/cold data separation help address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we explore federating additional sources such as Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, and Apache Paimon to build a unified analytical architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We all write SQL, but how many of us have looked under the hood of a relational database like PostgreSQL? This talk is a deep dive into the guts of the database engine, tracking a simple SELECT statement from the moment you hit "Enter" to the final result set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll lift the veil on the core components: the parser, the planner (and the optimizer's black magic!), and the executor, and see how they transform a text string into a low-level, high-performance operation. Using a live, interactive session on a PostgreSQL instance, we'll expose the role of the shared buffer cache, explain why an index works (or doesn't), explore the true cost of I/O, and understand the significance of the binary log (WAL) on read operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a developer frustrated with slow queries or a database administrator looking to squeeze out every millisecond of performance, you'll leave this talk with a mental model that demystifies query execution and gives you the knowledge to write queries that fly.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Server, Storage Engine, Protocol, Client: Suspects of a MySQL Performance Mystery</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While optimizing a new heap storage engine across both MySQL and a PostgreSQL-based database we encountered a puzzling result: while on MySQL the throughput stalled below 500k tpmC, on the other database it achieved over 1 million tpmC. The mystery deepened when three different TPC-C benchmarks each told a conflicting story about MySQL’s speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk details the systematic investigation to resolve these contradictions and reclaim the lost performance. We’ll walk through the methodical process of isolating variables across the entire software stack, dissecting benchmark implementations, profiling execution end-to-end with advanced tools, analyzing client/server protocol behavior, and comparing query optimization plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation revealed that the performance gap was not caused by a single flaw, but by a cascade of inefficiencies, in multiple areas of the stack. Subtle issues in query planning, protocol handling, and client-side implementation conspired to create overwhelming overhead. By addressing these interconnected problems holistically – through optimizer fixes, protocol enhancements, and client improvements – we transformed MySQL’s performance profile to reveal the engine’s true potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome was a dramatic turnaround: with additional improvements the performance of the new engine on MySQL reaches almost 2 million tpmC now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case study underscores a critical lesson: database performance, for OLTP workloads in particular, is determined not by any single component, but by the precise alignment of the entire database stack, from the client down to the storage engine.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RonDB is a high-performance, MySQL-compatible distributed database engineered for real-time, latency-critical workloads. Built on decades of development in the MySQL NDB Cluster—led by the original founder of the NDB product—RonDB extends the NDB storage engine with new capabilities, cloud-native automation, and modern APIs tailored for large-scale AI and online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe how RonDB consistently delivers 1–4 ms latency even for large batched operations involving hundreds of rows and multi-megabyte payloads, and will explain the architectural techniques that make such performance possible. We will highlight RonDB’s role as the online feature store powering the Hopsworks Real-Time AI platform, deployed in production at companies such as Zalando for personalized recommendations and other low-latency machine-learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session will also introduce key components of the RonDB ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rondb-helm – Kubernetes and Helm tooling for deploying, managing, and scaling RonDB clusters in cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rondb-tools – Scripts and automation utilities for quickly setting up local or distributed RonDB testbeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New API layers, including:
• A REST API server offering batch key operations, batch scans, and aggregated SQL queries.
• An experimental Redis-compatible interface, enabling RonDB to act as a durable, high-throughput backend behind standard Redis commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will outline the active collaboration between the RonDB team and Oracle’s MySQL NDB Cluster engineers, and how RonDB extends and complements the upstream NDB ecosystem. In addition, we will present ongoing cooperation with Datagraph to build a SPARQL interface to RonDB, leveraging Datagraph’s Common Lisp NDB API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will come away with a clear understanding of how RonDB achieves its performance characteristics, how it integrates with modern real-time AI pipelines, and how to deploy, operate, and experiment with RonDB using the available open-source tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DuckDB in the Cloud: A Simple, Powerful SQL Engine for Your Lakehouse</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;DuckDB has traditionally been seen as a last-mile analytics powerhouse, the fastest way to run a SQL query on your laptop. But DuckDB offers more than just fast SQL, of course; it supports full database semantics and ACID transactions, behaving like a fully fledged, in-process OLAP database. The in-process component has sometimes been viewed as a limitation when considering DuckDB as a data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DuckDB now supports reading and writing to most Open Table Formats (OTFs), including Iceberg, Delta, and DuckLake. This capability puts DuckDB in a very different position: it allows DuckDB to act as a SQL engine in the cloud (or on your local machine) and run queries against any OTF stored in remote cloud storage. DuckDB can now be the all-mighty, single-node query engine that powers your data analytics use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will also dive into:
- Why this change allows for a "multi-player" DuckDB experience.
- How DuckDB efficiently queries very large tables leveraging table statistics and cache.
- Why building native implementations with minimal dependencies to interact with OTFs is hard but can potentially pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Observability data isn’t typically blended with the data that your Analysts are working with. These data types are typically stored in entirely separate databases, and interrogated through different tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that needn’t be the case. At Grafana Labs we’ve started blending this data together, to answer questions that we or our customers have, such as:
- How much revenue did that downtime cost me?
- How did latency impact on sales last Black Friday?
- Which customers were impacted by that incident, and which ones are the highest priority to follow up with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FOSS projects we’re combining to get there are:
- The LGTM stack (github.com/grafana) for Observability
- Cube core (cube.dev/docs/product/getting-started/core) for Semantic Layer
- dbt core (github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) for transforming SQL data
- Grafana itself to blend, visualise and even alert on the end-result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk I’ll describe how you too can fit these pieces together and use them to answer similar questions for your own context.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone is running their applications on Kubernetes these days, most of the time the application servers are stateless so it is easy to do so because the database behind the application is responsible for storing the state. What if you would also want to run you database on the same Kubernetes stack. Will you use stateful sets? Will you use network attached storage? These types of storage are introducing a lot of disk latency because of the mandatory network hops. This is why in many environments the database servers still are dedicated machines that are treated as pets while the rest of the fleet is more like cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session I will speak about how we run our databases on Kubernetes by using the local ephemeral storage to store your data and also how we are confident we will not loose it in the process of doing so!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL already knows how to parse SQL, track object dependencies, and understand your schema. Most tools that work with schemas reimplement this from scratch. What if you just asked Postgres instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk digs into the techniques that make that possible. We’ll start with the shadow database pattern: applying schema files to a temporary PostgreSQL instance and letting Postgres handle all parsing and validation. Then we’ll explore pg_depend and the system catalogs, where PostgreSQL tracks that your view depends on a function, which depends on a table, which depends on a custom type. I’ll show the exact catalog queries that extract this dependency graph, the edge cases that make it interesting (extension-owned objects, implicit sequences, array types, function bodies that pg_depend can’t see), and how to turn it all into a correct topological ordering for migration generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this while building &lt;a href="https://pgmt.dev/"&gt;pgmt&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that diffs PostgreSQL schemas to generate migrations. But the techniques apply to anything that needs to understand a Postgres schema -- linters, drift detectors, visualization tools, CI validation -- and they let you build on Postgres’s own knowledge instead of reinventing it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses the design choices behind this open source project leveraging Debezium  :
https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-sink-connector
It reliably replicates data to ClickHouse, a well known open source real time analytics database that can be deployed anywhere. The sink-connector provides an alternative to proprietary solutions that typically lock people in or are only available on the cloud. It works with MySQL, MariaDB. Postgres, Oracle (experimental) and MongoDB.
As a bonus,  Binary logs analysis and Time Travel will also be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using SQL from other programming languages can prove to be quite the hassle: wrangling the database rows into the host's language types is tedious and error prone, and making sure the application code stays up to date with the ever-changing database schema is just as challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these developer experience shortcomings ORMs try to shield the developer from ever having to write any SQL at all. This doesn't feel totally satisfying though: as developers we are always keen on using the right language for the job, so what would it look like to fully embrace SQL instead of trying to abstract it away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at Squirrel (https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel), a library that tackles database access in Gleam (https://gleam.run): a functional, statically-typed language. We'll explore how code generation from raw SQL can help bridge the gap between the database and a functional language without compromising on type-safety, performance or developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Time Series databases face the significant challenge of processing vast amounts of data. At VictoriaMetrics, we are actively developing an open-source Time Series database entirely from scratch using Go. Our average installation handles between 2 to 4 million samples per second during ingestion, with larger setups managing over 100 million samples per second on a single cluster.
In his presentation, we will explore various techniques essential for constructing write-heavy applications such as: 
- Understanding and mitigating write amplification.
- Implementing instant database snapshots.
- Safeguarding against data corruption post power outages.
- Evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing Write Ahead Log.
- Enhancing reliability in Network File System (NFS) environments.
Throughout the talk, we will illustrate these concepts with real code examples sourced from open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Contributing to MariaDB:
 Learn how to contribute to the MariaDB server codebase. And be prepared for what it takes. And see what you will learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what it would take to actually get your contribution into the MariaDB server codebase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will take one specific contribution and follow through its processing. It's a bug fix contribution. 2 lines of actual code change. On smaller codebases, used by less people, this would have probably taken minutes to process.
It is somewhat different with the MariaDB server's codebase. But for a very good reason!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to Postgres:
Contributing to open source can feel intimidating early in your career, especially with a project as widely used and critical as Postgres. This feeling can be exacerbated by the Postgres contribution process, which revolves around mailing lists and commit fests instead of GitHub issues and pull requests. Often, confidence comes after action; the first patch is the hardest. Even small contributions can reach thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk traces my path from setting up a local build and gaining familiarity with the codebase to contributing bug-fix patches and documentation updates. Also, it outlines how the Postgres development process and community operate. The aim is to demystify the process so more engineers feel confident contributing to Postgres, and leave with the context and practical steps to make their first (or next) patch and take their favourite database to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;From plain-old Postgres to the Grafana stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir), OpenSearch, Cassandra, and ClickHouse, the landscape of telemetry storage options is as vast as it is overwhelming. With so many choices, how do we decide which datastore is right for the job?
In this talk, Joshua will guide attendees through the foundational principles of telemetry—covering metrics, traces, logs, profiles, and wide events—and break down the strengths and limitations of different database technologies for each use case.
We’ll examine how traditional relational databases like Postgres can still hold their own, where OpenSearch and Prometheus fit into the picture, and why specialized stacks like LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) are so popular in modern observability pipelines. And, of course, we’ll highlight the growing role of ClickHouse as a versatile and high-performance option for logs, traces, and more and VictoriaMetrics as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.
By the end of this session, attendees will have a clearer understanding of the trade-offs between these datastores and how to make informed decisions based on the unique requirements of their systems. Whether you’re building an observability stack from scratch or looking to optimize an existing setup, this tour of the observability datastore landscape will leave you better equipped to navigate the options.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Change Data Capture (CDC) has become foundational for real-time analytics, cross-region replication, event-driven systems, and streaming ingestion pipelines. Databases like MySQL and Postgres replication expose change streams through a single-writer log. CDC in these systems is trivial. Modern distributed SQL databases like TiDB  require a fundamentally different design and handle bigger challenges because they need to order the writes of multiple writers and deal with millions of tables, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about TiCDC’s architecture and how it handles multiple writers, millions of tables,  1000s of writers with its event-driven pipeline. To preserve total order, TiCDC must merge, order, and stream updates coming concurrently from multiple regions, Raft groups, and storage nodes—while preserving correctness and low latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore the challenges and the evolution of TiCDC design over several iterations,
With lessons learnt the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Database usage in practice often involves heavy text processing. For example, in "observability" use cases, databases must extract, store, and search billions of log messages daily. Most databases, including many column-oriented OLAP databases, struggle with such massive amounts of text data. The only way to process text data at scale is by using specialized inverted indexes in databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation explains how inverted indexes work and which (text) search patterns they support. Where appropriate, we describe our experience and the gotchas we encountered when adding an inverted index to ClickHouse, one of the most popular open-source databases for analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Mark Raasveldt and Hannes Mühleisen (who went on to create &lt;a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb"&gt;DuckDB&lt;/a&gt; presented a VLDB paper entitled &lt;a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2018/papers/14-networking/p1022-muehleisen.pdf"&gt;“Don’t Hold My Data Hostage – A Case For Client Protocol Redesign.”&lt;/a&gt; Their paper proposed the use of columnar serialization to achieve order-of-magnitude improvements in query result transfer performance. Eight years later, this talk revisits Raasveldt and Mühleisen’s argument and describes the central role that the &lt;a href="https://arrow.apache.org"&gt;Apache Arrow&lt;/a&gt; project has played in realizing this vision—through the dissemination of Arrow IPC, Arrow Flight, Arrow Flight SQL, Arrow over HTTP, and &lt;a href="https://arrow.apache.org/adbc"&gt;ADBC&lt;/a&gt; across numerous open source and commercial query systems. The talk concludes with a call to action to introduce Arrow-based transport to the systems that continue to “hold data hostage.”&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>From Disks to Distributed: Our Journey of Database Evolution in the Cloud</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Our database had reached a point where failure scenarios were becoming increasingly complex and time consuming. A single node could take up to 15 minutes to recover. It was expensive to run and operate, and it simply couldn’t scale to meet the customer demand we were facing. It became clear that we needed a new design.
By leveraging a modern architecture and the latest open-source technologies, we rebuilt our database for the cloud era. Recoveries that once took 15 minutes now complete in seconds. Operational costs dropped by 50%, and query latencies improved by 200%. These gains weren’t the result of any single change, but of a holistic redesign powered by technologies like Vortex, DataFusion, Delta Lake, and Rust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Thor will walk you through the end-to-end journey of this evolution
the failure patterns and scaling limits that forced a rethink,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the architectural principles that guided the redesign,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the trade-offs and dead ends along the way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how modern open-source components were evaluated and integrated, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the concrete performance and reliability improvements unlocked by the new design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll leave with a blueprint for modernizing a legacy data system: how to identify when your architecture is holding you back, and how to apply today’s open-source ecosystem to build a cloud-native database that’s fast, resilient, and ready for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Federating Databases with Apache DataFusion: Open Query Planning and Arrow-Native Interoperability</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache DataFusion is emerging as a powerful open-source foundation for building interoperable data systems, thanks to its strongly modular design, Arrow-native execution model, and growing ecosystem of extension libraries. In this talk, we'll explore our contributions to the DataFusion ecosystem—most notably &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-federation"&gt;DataFusion Federation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for cross-database query execution and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-table-providers"&gt;DataFusion Table Providers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that connect DataFusion to a wide range of backends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll show how we use these components to federate queries to databases such as &lt;strong&gt;TiDB&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;InfluxDB 2&lt;/strong&gt;, and how this fits into a broader data fabric/API generation work we're doing at Twintag. We'll also discuss our work on Arrow-native interfaces, including an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-flight-sql-server"&gt;Arrow Flight SQL Server implementation for DataFusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and a prototype Flight SQL endpoint for TiDB, which together enable a fully Arrow-based pipeline spanning query submission, execution, and federated dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session highlights practical patterns for building distributed data infrastructure using open libraries rather than monolithic systems, and offers a look at where Arrow and DataFusion are headed as shared interoperability layers for modern databases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>LSM vs. B‑Tree: RocksDB and WiredTiger for Cloud‑Native Distributed Databases</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native databases often use open-source embedded key-value stores on each node or shard. OLTP workloads are read- and write-intensive, typically relying on indexes for data access. Two main on-disk structures are prevalent: B-Trees, such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger"&gt;WiredTiger&lt;/a&gt;, and LSM-Trees, like &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb"&gt;RocksDB&lt;/a&gt;.
This talk explores the similarities and differences in their internal implementations, as well as the trade-offs among read, write, and storage amplification. It also compares these structures to traditional fixed-size block storage in RDBMS and discusses the differences in caching the working set in memory and ensuring durability through write-ahead logging.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How to Prevent Your AI from Returning Garbage: It Starts and Ends with Data Engineering</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="databases">Databases</track>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Your AI application returns wrong answers. Not because of your LLM choice or vector database—but because of the data engineering ( or lack there of) nobody wants to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technical deep dive shows why embedding models, chunking strategies, and search filtering have more impact on AI accuracy than switching from one model to another. Using real production data, we'll demonstrate how naive vector search returns Star Trek reviews when users ask about Star Wars, how poor chunking strategies lose critical context (Who want's their AI to respond to how to fix a headache with a head transplant?), and why "just use a vector" without proper data engineering guarantees hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embedding model selection: dimensions, token limits, and silent truncation failures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chunking strategies: when to chunk, how to preserve context, and the double-embedding approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid search: combining Full Text/BM25 keyword matching with vector similarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filtering architecture: pre-filter vs post-filter performance trade-offs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production gotchas: triggers, performance, batch processing, and cold start problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of the examples will be for PostgreSQL, This is talk will be database-agnostic, no matter if you are using PostgreSQL, MariaDB, ClickHouse, or others you will learn something!  In AI Land, the hard problem is always data engineering, not database selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users don't care about inference speed—they care about accuracy. This talk shows how to engineer your data pipeline so your AI doesn't lie.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is a review of the current state of Free and Open Source Software on Mobile devices. Mobile computing continues to be one of the most conspicuous and rapidly evolving software ecosystems ever, and open source software is at the heart of it - from the Linux kernel, the tooling, languages and libraries needed to write apps, through to devices that run a completely open source stack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about the changes in the way Google releases AOSP code and how that affects developers of custom ROMs and off-the-shelf devices. We will talk about developments in fully Android-free platforms, and we will talk about hardware support, drawing on voices from across the FOSS mobile community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be of interest to those already involved in the FOSS and mobile communities, and also to those who are just interested to get an overview of the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Android support for RISC-V is advancing rapidly, and this talk delivers an in-depth technical update on the open-source AOSP porting effort. We will walk through the current status of AOSP on RISC-V platforms, including ART/LLVM, Bionic, HAL and vendor-interface development, and compatibility work for emerging RISC-V SoCs.
The session will examine the key engineering challenges encountered along the way—such as JIT/AOT differences on RISC-V, graphics-stack porting (Mesa, DRM/KMS, GPU drivers), GSI support, SELinux policy bring-up, vendor_boot and dynamic-partition layout, and end-to-end boot-flow integration. We will also highlight upstream contributions completed so far, the remaining gaps in the AOSP tree, and the milestones required to achieve full device bring-up and CTS/VTS compliance.
Attendees will come away with a clear understanding of the progress to date and concrete opportunities for community collaboration to accelerate a fully open, fully native Android ecosystem for RISC-V devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is more than just the yearly and now half-yearly releases of the Android platform source code. It consists of 3000+ git repositories, 1500+ repo XML manifests, and 1.8+TB of (compressed) source code data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I want to give a detailed tour of the AOSP releases, the code, and everything that can be found in the AOSP repositories: How are the &lt;code&gt;_rXXX&lt;/code&gt; releases assembled? And why do the git tags sometimes go backward? Where do I find the source code for my Pixel devices (until 2025)? What are the Build IDs? What are Brillo manifests, and why are they also in the AOSP? How are security patches released? Why is the number of git repos increasing with every release? And why is it decreasing with Android 16? How did the amount of rust and other code evolve over time? What is Project mainline and apex's? And where do I find the source code for these "Google Play system updates"? Where do I find the AAOS (Android Automotive Operating System) code and its releases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and other questions I want to answer in my talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Why Android Builds Are So Slow — And What We Can Do About It</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="foss-on-mobile">FOSS on Mobile</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building Android is notoriously slow and resource-hungry. Even on high-end hardware, a full AOSP build can take hours, and each release continues to grow by ~10–20%, amplifying compile times and storage pressure. For anyone maintaining custom ROMs, vendor trees, or downstream forks, faster builds are not just nice to have: regulation requiring shipping fixes faster makes build performance a core productivity issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the Android ecosystem has tried to keep pace with this growing complexity. Solutions like ccache and distributed build systems (goma, reclient), and even experiments with Bazel have all aimed to make builds faster and more scalable. But these tools were designed for other projects and struggle with Android’s unique challenges — lack of sandboxing, incomplete dependency tracking, and heterogeneous toolchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explains how the Android build system actually works, why incremental builds so often fall apart, and where the time really goes. We’ll then walk through the major open-source acceleration approaches, their strengths and limitations, and what it takes to run them effectively in your own infrastructure—whether you’re a hobbyist with a homelab or maintaining a large downstream tree.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://izzyondroid.org/"&gt;IzzyOnDroid&lt;/a&gt;, we provide &lt;a href="https://izzyondroid.org/about/security/ReproducibleBuilds/"&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/a&gt; (RBs) for Android apps. In this talk, I want to outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what Reproducible Builds are and what are some of their advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how we approach Reproducible Builds in combination with our &lt;a href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid"&gt;Android App Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some of the challenges of Reproducible Builds for Android apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most frequent sources/causes of failed RBs we encounter regularly (and how to address them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things Android App Developers should be aware of / take care for to give their apps the best chances to succeed with RBs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk, there should hopefully be some time for further questions (Q&amp;amp;A).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Open-source HSM-based signing for AOSP-based projects with limited resources: Lessons from CalyxOS signing redesign</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Securely signing Android releases, while being a critical process and operation for every AOSP-based project, has been lacking in comprehensive documentation, especially for building a production-grade and enterprise-level signing infrastructure. This talk presents our experience in designing and implementing a Hardware Security Module (HSM)-based signing solution for CalyxOS that ensures transparency and operational practicality while upholding security standards widely endorsed by security experts with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through our process of defining criteria for secure signing operations and redesigning a signing infrastructure. In particular, we will discuss the trade-offs and our trajectory to technical decisions, including:
* Security and operational pros and cons: Why use an HSM; 
* Our criteria for evaluating HSM solutions: Exemplified with the comparison between YubiHSM 2, Nitrokey HSM, Amazon Cloud HSM, and Entrust nShield in open-source standards, cost-effectiveness, and operational practicality; 
* PKCS#11 integration challenges: What it is, why it matters for HSM compatibility, and the specific code changes and scripts we made to to support it;
* Key ceremony design: The use of Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) schema for recovery and additional backup and lessons from the provisioning process; and 
* Audit logging and cryptographic verification of signing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, this talk invites discussions from participants on experiences in operational security and building trust through transparency and communication. We will focus on how to balance complex Android development needs and overcome challenges with constrained resource and scant systematic documentation. This talk aims to start collaborations on issues such as concurrent multi-device signing, ceremony design, and community-driven criteria across FOSS development teams.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>NewPipe - Porting an Android app to Sailfish OS</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="foss-on-mobile">FOSS on Mobile</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NewPipe is a widely used &lt;strong&gt;FOSS Android app&lt;/strong&gt; that provides privacy-respecting access to &lt;strong&gt;YouTube, PeerTube, and other streaming services&lt;/strong&gt;. It can search, view channels, play videos, listen to playlists, download media, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing an application with so many distinct features often involves compromises or &lt;strong&gt;feature trade-offs&lt;/strong&gt;. During the talk, we'll explain how TeamNewPipe takes these decisions together with the community. In recent years the team has been supported by &lt;strong&gt;NewPipe e.V.&lt;/strong&gt;, a German association which strives to promote access to libre digital media, even outside of the NewPipe app. This more general spirit dates back to the beginning of NewPipe, when the &lt;em&gt;backend library&lt;/em&gt; that scrapes data from services was made independent of the user interface, making the backend ideal for use in other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually it's hard to port Android apps to other mobile Linux platforms due to the use of Java and the tight integration with the Android APIs. The user interface libraries required aren't available outside of Android emulation layers and, even if they were, the user interface paradigms would differ greatly. In this talk we'll go on to describe our efforts to &lt;strong&gt;port the app to Sailfish OS&lt;/strong&gt;, a Qt-based mobile Linux platform with a user interface paradigm that differs significantly from Android's. The process took us on a &lt;strong&gt;fascinating journey&lt;/strong&gt;, compiling Java code for a platform &lt;em&gt;without a JVM&lt;/em&gt; and integrating it with the Qt (C++, QML, Silica) layers above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover topics relevant to AOSP users, mobile Linux users, the Sailfish OS community, Android developers and Qt developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since August 2025 IzzyOnDroid has been providing app download stats for the IzzyOnDroid repository and since September, Neo Store has included these download stats in the client, with Droid-ify support hopefully releasing before this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lightning talk will quickly go through:
1. How the download stats system works
2. Which applications already show the stats
3. How to use the stats in your own applications&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The maps application is one of the main usage of the smartphones nowdays. Let's introduce Cardinal, (not) yet another mobile maps application. It intends to definitely offer an alternative to Google Maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk, we will introduce what it is, how it differs from other open source maps application (OSMand, Comaps and others), and how we are building it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of code releases from AOSP: there is a major release once per year, Quarterly Platform Releases (QPR) every quarter, plus releases specific to particular segments, such as Automotive, or devices, e.g. the Pixel Fold. On top of this there are regular security fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short talk will try to make sense of all of these data points, and show how they relate back to the release number, which is the canonical identifier of a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaway: Knowing the way Google identifies releases helps you understand the release cadence and which tag you may want to use when building Android&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenHarmony offers a compelling FOSS alternative to the mobile OS duopoly, but porting it to real phones presents unique technical challenges. This talk shares practical insights from bringing Oniro, an Eclipse Foundation project focused on making this technology usable beyond its original ecosystem, to mobile devices.
We'll cover the complete porting workflow: QEMU-based x86_64 emulation for rapid development cycles, kernel adaptation strategies for diverse chipsets, and our LibHybris integration to bridge OpenHarmony's musl libc with proprietary Android binary drivers, unlocking GPU, and peripheral support on existing hardware.
Beyond the technical stack, we'll discuss developer experience improvements that lower contribution barriers: VS Code-based tooling, and early app ecosystem expansion through React Native and cross-platform framework support.
Whether you're interested in AOSP alternatives, mainline device enablement, or building truly open mobile platforms, this talk demonstrates a practical approach to accelerating FOSS mobile adoption today.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I maintain the Collabora Office mobile apps: office software for mobile devices based on LibreOffice. I've been at FOSDEM twice before, and each time I've had people approach me and ask if the apps could run on mobile Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time, I've had to tell them "not yet". This year, I finally have a mobile Linux device running Collabora Office. It's not perfect yet, but it works, and it can give a glimpse into a future where a mobile-optimised Collabora Office is available outside of the mainstream Android/iOS mobile duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give you an overview of how we got here, how I'm doing this, and what's still left to do before we can get my demo on your mobile Linux device.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let's review what has happened in the lands of upstream kernel development on Fairphone devices in recent times. Where are we now in 2026? Where are the major pain points now? Can you use postmarketOS on a Fairphone as daily driver yet? Let's find out!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Phones running Linux became reality in last few years, and they do have cameras. Every notebook and most computers do have cameras, too, and there's a lot of effort to get good support for them concentrated around libcamera project. Unfortunately phones have different hardware than computers (dumb vs. USB cameras) and use cases are very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavel will explain challenges presented by phone hardware, explain what is needed to take good photos with phone such as Librem 5 or OnePlus 6, and explain additional challenges with video recording. He'll also talk about his work in this area, Clicks Machine and Millicam and improvements to Megapixels, Millipixels and Libcamera projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>UnifiedPush - Push notifications. Decentralized and Open Source</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;To understand how we can replace Google push notifications (FCM) with something open source and decentralized, we need to understand how they work and why they are needed in the first place. This talk explains the mechanics of push notifications and why, despite their potentially bad reputation, they are a more elegant solution than having every app maintain its own persistent server connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While open-source tools like microG can remove proprietary Google software from your Android phone, the actual notifications are still sent via Google's servers (Firebase Cloud Messaging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://unifiedpush.org/"&gt;UnifiedPush&lt;/a&gt; is a framework that allows push notifications to be delivered in a decentralized manner or through self-hosted servers. Numerous open-source Android apps already support UnifiedPush, including &lt;a href="https://tusky.app/"&gt;Tusky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ltt.rs"&gt;Ltt.rs&lt;/a&gt;, Fedilab, &lt;a href="https://www.davx5.com/"&gt;DAVx⁵&lt;/a&gt;, Fennec, Element, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation ends with a short demo on how to use UnifiedPush on Android.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Running mainline Linux on the Unisoc-based Jolla C2</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;So far, almost all mobile phones capable of functioning with close-to-mainline Linux kernels (with the exception of special phones such as the PinePhone) are based on Qualcomm SoCs. Unisoc is an alternative SoC manufacturer from China that is often overlooked due to its focus on the low-end segment and lack of upstream kernel support for important features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Jolla released the C2 community phone as a new reference device for Sailfish OS, based on the low-end Reeder S19 Max Pro S from Turkey. This phone uses the Unisoc UMS9230 (Tiger T606 / T7200) SoC. A bit more than a year has passed since the phone was first released and the official port still uses libhybris. Meanwhile, I have been working on an unofficial mainline Linux port and am daily-driving it now. Some things are still not working, but there has been a lot of progress since the last FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is going to explore the challenges involved in porting mainline Linux to a new SoC platform, the features I have implemented so far, and the opportunities this creates for Sailfish OS and other mobile Linux projects such as postmarketOS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://os.gnome.org/"&gt;GNOME OS&lt;/a&gt; is GNOME's development, testing and QA operating system. It builds the in-development versions of the GNOME desktop and core applications. It is also a modern image-based Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'm going to present recent efforts to run GNOME OS on phones. Right now, the FairPhone 5 and the OnePlus 6 are supported, but ideally we could support any phone that is supported by the mainline Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly present the different tools and projects that make this possible, and what we're hoping to achieve from this initiative: better testing for the GNOME applications, and more ways to do FOSS on Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It has been two years since the initial mainline Linux support for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650) was posted on the very day of its marketing announcement and used to present the Qualcomm platforms mainline state in this very conference on an SM8650 HDK development board. What started as basic boot support with display has evolved into a fully-featured upstream ecosystem, but the road was far from smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will explore the technical evolution of SM8650 support, moving beyond the "it boots" milestone to a fully usable system. We will dissect the challenges of enabling complex subsystems—from the Hexagon DSPs and Adreno 750 GPU to the intricate power domains that modern SoCs demand to properly support runtime power management and suspend-to-ram state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also address the often-overlooked bootloader story, showcasing the current state of upstream U-Boot on this platform and how it interacts with the standard EFI boot flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Talk Will Feature a Technical Post-Mortem about the whole upstreaming process and a live demonstration running mainline Linux on actual Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powered device running the mainline kernel with code changes—proving that upstream support is no longer just for development boards.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/opencloud-eu/"&gt;OpenCloud&lt;/a&gt; has the design goal to not use a relational database. This requires
a deeper integration with the underlying storage system, ie. through extensive use of extended file attributes. Since features like file revisions, trash and shares are inevitable nowadays, OpenCloud makes use of SDS native supported storage aspects to build these advanced features in an efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will give an overview of the storage aspects that are relevant from
OpenClouds perspective, the integrations that we currently support as well as ongoing

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ceph storage: Enterprise meets Community. Our traditional Ceph storage roadmap session starts with everything that is happening in the upstream project this year and what we have planned for the future, and closes with the state of what is backed by vendor-supported products. A 360-degree look at the state of Ceph integration with OpenStack and what is planned going forward in the broader storage space, in particular in regards to features relevant to container workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural familiarity with Ceph is required. This session contains zero vendor pitches, and it is a caffeinated tour of what the Ceph community is working on at the feature level. Hang on to your hats, and bring questions!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The CernVM File System (CVMFS) is a scalable, high-performance distributed filesystem developed at CERN to efficiently deliver software and static data across global computing infrastructures, primarily designed for high-energy physics (HEP).
For the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) only, CVMFS is serving around 4 billion files (~2PB of data).
CVMFS uses a content-addressable storage model, where files are stored in the form of cryptographic hashes, ensuring integrity and enabling deduplication.
It follows a multi-caching architecture where the data are published in a single source of truth (Stratum 0), mirrored by a network of distributed servers (Stratum 1), and propagated to the clients via forward proxies.
This multi-layer of caching allows for a cost-effective alternative to traditional file systems, where clients are offered reliable access to versioned read-only datasets with low overhead.
In this talk we will focus on how CVMFS interoperates with the highly adopted S3 storage, providing a conventional POSIX filesystem view of the objects, using the available metadata for efficient exploitation of the medium.
We will also highlight the benefit of using CVMFS with containerized workflows and demonstrate tools developed to facilitate data publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With cost and performance requirements becoming more and more relevant in today’s storage products, technologies that leverage algorithmic driven improvements are getting a lot of attention. Erasure coding is the most prominent algorithm and a meanwhile well established standard for saving on-disk space requirements in storage. It is built upon mathematical techniques.
In my talk I want to explain and explore these techniques, and thereby the mathematical reasoning underlying these algorithms in a way that does not require a background in mathematics itself (or at least only an insignificant amount). 
I am not a software engineer myself, just an interested mathematics student who aims to introduce someone who is interested and not too fond of maths to the underlying theory of erasure coding.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found your CephFS setup mysteriously broken and had no clue how it got there? Maybe someone ran a CLI command in haste, or a misstep happened weeks ago. We have suspicions, but can’t really recall what might've splintered the system. That changes now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce a robust command history logging mechanism for CephFS: a persistent log of CephFS commands and standalone tool invocations, backed by LibCephSQLite. Think of it as “shell history,” but purpose-built for Ceph with time ranges, filters, and structured metadata. Every ceph fs subvolume rm, every ceph config set, every mischievous --force — now recorded, timestamped, and queryable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know what was run last Tuesday at 3 AM? Or who triggered that well-intentioned-but-catastrophic disaster recovery script? Or just list the last 100 commands before things exploded? It’s all there. This helps debug incidents faster, provides a clear audit trail, and opens the door to proactive traceability. So, when things go sideways around CephFS and no one's sure why — this history has your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is CephFS-first but not CephFS-only. The path to full cluster command traceability starts here.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Starting with the Tentacle release, Ceph introduces mgmt-gateway: a modular, nginx-based service that provides a secure, highly available entry point to the entire management and monitoring stack. This talk will cover its architecture and deployment, how it centralizes access to the dashboard and observability tools, and how OIDC-based Single Sign-On streamlines authentication. We’ll also show how mgmt-gateway enhances security and access control while delivering full HA for Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and the dashboard, resulting in a more resilient and user-friendly experience for Ceph administrators.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Network is one of the bottlenecks influencing the Ceph performance.
Especially the Ceph cluster network requires a high throughput and a low latency to speedup the I/O operations.
The performance can be increased employing a shared memory communication (SMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMC is a separate and fast communication channel implemented in the server hardware.
While SMC-R (Shared Memory Communications over Remote Direct Memory Access) use Ethernet,
SMC-D (Shared Memory Communications - Direct Memory Access) does employ the hardware shared memory.
SMC-D channel does offload Ethernet and increase the Ceph cluster network throughput resulting in higher Ceph I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explain in detail SMC-D stack (the user space, the kernel space, and the firmware level), implementation in Ceph, and integration tests.
We detail the performance analysis, namely Ceph setup to generate a high load on the cluster network,
the client load, and the whole stack performance analysis.
Performance analysis protocol and the results will be presented in tables and graphs.
Advantages and disadvantages of the SMC-D channel will be given too.
Implementation of SMC-D in Ceph demonstrate a significant I/O throughput increase.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Umbrella ("U") is planned as the next major release for the Ceph Distributed Storage System open-source project. Ceph File System development in Umbrella is aimed at addressing various pain points around the file system disaster recovery process, performance metrics, MDS tuning, user data protection and backups. Many of these themes were also discussed in the Cephalocon 2024 and various user/dev meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk details improvements in each of those areas with a specific focus on ease of use and automation. Many noteworthy features have been introduced thereby improving the user experience across the board. Umbrella release aims to provide Ceph File System users and administrators a better and smoother experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/cern-cta/CTA"&gt;CERN Tape Archive (CTA)&lt;/a&gt; is the open source solution developed at CERN to store more than 1 Exabyte of data from CERN’s experimental programmes. CTA interfaces with two disk systems widely used by the High-Energy Physics (HEP) community, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cern-eos/eos"&gt;EOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dCache/dcache"&gt;dCache&lt;/a&gt;. However, until now there has been no integration with systems used outside of HEP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at current industry standards, the leading interface for file and object storage is S3, which includes cold storage extensions for data archival. The CTA team are investigating whether CTA can be fronted by an S3 API. During this talk, we’ll review a proof-of-concept implementation, and look at alternative solutions to explore along with their respective trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Concurrent storage access via standard network protocols such as SMB and NFS has become a common feature of many proprietary storage products. Samba, the leading open‑source SMB implementation, has long supported a limited set of multiprotocol scenarios by leveraging kernel interfaces and by allowing aspects of multiprotocol access to be implemented in the filesystem. Over time, several storage vendors have exploited these capabilities while using their own proprietary filesystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will present our plan for a fully open‑source multiprotocol stack built on CephFS, Samba, and NFS‑Ganesha. First, we will describe the testing infrastructure we are creating and the use‑cases we intend to support in the initial release. We will then outline our approach to exclusive file locking and to a unified access‑control model.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces an advanced storage acceleration strategy for I/O-intensive container workloads. In environments like CI/CD pipelines or database applications, performance is often constrained by storage latency. Our plan addresses this by implementing a transparent data caching layer that uses high-speed local storage to hold frequently accessed data, significantly reducing retrieval times and load on the primary storage system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a core focus on disaster recovery and fast StatefulSet failover, the primary cloud storage volume is intentionally left pristine and unmodified, containing solely user data All cache intelligence is kept local to the node. This design is critical for operational robustness, as it ensures the data can be restored to a consistent point in time, a fundamental requirement for reliable disaster recovery This allows the volume to be safely attached to any node for rapid failover maximizing both performance and data safety.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For high-performance proxy services, moving data is the primary bottleneck. Whether it is an NFS-Ganesha server or a FUSE-based Ceph client, the application burns CPU cycles copying payloads between kernel and user space just to route traffic. While &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt; exists, it imposes a rigid pipe-based architecture that is difficult to integrate into modern asynchronous event loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a pure software zero-copy design that works with standard network stacks. In this model, a specialized kernel socket aggregates incoming network packets into a scatter-gather list. Instead of copying this data to the application, the kernel notifies userspace—potentially via &lt;code&gt;io_uring&lt;/code&gt;—that a new data segment is ready and provides an opaque handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application sees the headers to make logic decisions but acts only as a traffic controller for the payload. It uses the handle to forward the data to an egress socket or a driver like FUSE without ever touching the actual bytes. This talk will outline the design of this buffer-handling mechanism and demonstrate how it allows complex proxies like Ganesha and storage clients like Ceph to achieve true zero-copy throughput on standard hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern S3 workloads generate massive duplicate data—from backup chains to model checkpoints—quietly consuming petabytes. Ceph’s new S3 data deduplication feature solves this by identifying identical content through chunking and cryptographic hashing, storing it only once, and tracking references with a lightweight dedup index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explains how dedup works inside Ceph RGW: how chunks are created, how refcounts stay consistent under parallel writes, versioning, and deletes, and how the system avoids corruption using atomic metadata updates and safe garbage collection. We’ll also share early performance insights from large-scale tests and show how dedup can significantly reduce capacity, I/O, and network overhead—without requiring any changes to S3 applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in building efficient, scalable, open-source object storage, this session shows how Ceph makes S3 smarter with zero duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The world of SBOMs and software transparency artefacts - In-Toto attestations, VEX updates and much more - all mention digital signatures. But not with what and how we should validate these. One thing is for sure - we don't want to use the existing WebPKI. There are some interesting initiatives, like SigStore, but they do not solve all issues. It's time that we work on solving this problem and define a solution for digital signatures that is distributed, secure and trustworthy. This is a call for help!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pace at which quantum computing is evolving right now, threats of &lt;code&gt;harvest-now-decrypt-later&lt;/code&gt; becoming more relevant. The widely deployed classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC face a real risk of being broken by quantum attacks, most notably through Shor’s algorithm. This looming threat makes the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) urgent, not as a future project, but as a present-day migration challenge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have questions whether the transition to PQC is even necessary at the moment. It is true that quantum computers are years away, but it hardly matters because so many governments, telecom, defense entities worldwide are now requiring a transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this talk, we would focus on the practical hybrid transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. We would explore NIST’s PQC standardization efforts through newly selected algorithms particularly &lt;code&gt;ML-KEM (key-exchange), ML-DSA and SLH-DSA (digital signatures)&lt;/code&gt; in modern cryptographic infrastructures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transition from classical crypto to a hybrid model enable organizations to begin adopting PQC today without breaking interoperability or relying on fully quantum-resistant stacks before they’re ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this transition concrete, we will  demonstrate a &lt;code&gt;TLS connection with hybrid key-exchange and post-quantum signature&lt;/code&gt;, showing how post-quantum and classical algorithms can operate together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most container images in production are still unsigned, and even when signatures exist, they often provide no clear guarantee about where the artifact came from or what threat the signature is supposed to protect against. Supply-chain attacks exploit this gap and become an increasingly important issue when publishing or importing open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents security capabilities in Docker and Moby BuildKit that address these issues. BuildKit executes all build steps in isolated, immutable sandboxes strictly defined by the build definition, and produces SLSA attestations with complete snapshots of the build’s source material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Docker will provide a trusted BuildKit instance running inside GitHub Actions infrastructure. Artifacts produced there include signed attestations tied to a well-defined security boundary. The talk explains what guarantees this environment provides and how this differs from traditional approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session also covers how to update container-based pipelines to always validate all BuildKit inputs (images, Git sources, HTTP sources) using Rego policies and BuildKit attestations. These checks apply both to artifacts coming from the new trusted builder instance and to any other verifiable artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These improvements are designed to strengthen container security and raise the baseline for how open-source projects should sign, attest, and verify artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is widely considered good practice to sign commits.  But leveraging those signatures is hard.  &lt;a href="https://sequoia-pgp.gitlab.io/sequoia-git/"&gt;Sequoia git&lt;/a&gt; is a system to authenticate changes to a VCS repository. A project embeds a signing policy in their git repository, which says who is allowed to add commits, make releases, and modify the policy. &lt;a href="https://sequoia-pgp.gitlab.io/sequoia-git/man/sq-git-log.1.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sq-git log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can then authenticate a range of commits using the embedded policy.  Sequoia git distinguishes itself from projects like sigstore in that all of the information required to authenticate commits is available locally, and no third-party authorities are required.  In this talk, I'll present sequoia git's design, explain how it enforces a policy, and how to use it in your project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>An Endpoint Telemetry Blueprint for Security Teams</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are where most security incidents begin. Compromises often start with phishing, software vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations on individual laptops and servers. Modern security teams need rich endpoint telemetry for detection, investigation, and response. Commercial products often act as black boxes that limit flexibility, collect data in proprietary ways, and create vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a practical blueprint for building a scalable endpoint telemetry and security pipeline using open technologies. At the foundation is osquery, a Linux Foundation project that turns every endpoint into a high-fidelity sensor. On top of this, we build four layers: a control layer for managing endpoints, an ingestion, streaming, and storage layer for moving and retaining data, a detection and intelligence layer for applying rules and enrichment, and a correlation, visualization, and hunting layer for analysis and response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through architectural patterns, real-world lessons, and tradeoffs. Attendees will learn how to assemble their own endpoint telemetry stack from collection to correlation without relying on closed products.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Invisible Hypervisors: Stealthy Malware Analysis with HyperDbg</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;HyperDbg is a modern, open-source hypervisor-based debugger supporting both user- and kernel-mode debugging. Operating at the hypervisor level, it bypasses OS debugging APIs and offers stealthy hooks, unlimited simulated debug registers, fine-grained memory monitoring, I/O debugging, and full execution control, enabling analysts to observe malware with far greater reliability than traditional debuggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to debugger stealthiness and sandboxing, environment artifacts can reveal the presence of analysis tools - particularly under nested virtualization. To address this issue, we present HyperEvade, a transparency layer for HyperDbg. HyperEvade intercepts hypervisor-revealing instructions, normalizes timing sources, conceals virtualization-specific identifiers, and emulates native hardware behavior, reducing the observable footprint of the hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While perfect transparency remains a future endeavour, HyperEvade significantly raises the bar for stealthy malware analysis. By suppressing common detection vectors, it enables more realistic malware execution and reduces evasion, making HyperDbg a more dependable tool for observing evasive or self-protective malware. This talk covers HyperDbg’s architecture and features, HyperEvade’s design, and practical evaluation results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is a live tutorial of hacking against keyboards of all forms. Attacking the keyboard is the ultimate strategy to hijack a session before it is encrypted, capturing plaintext at the source and (often) in much simpler ways than those required to attack network protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session we explore available attack vectors against traditional keyboards, starting with plain old keyloggers. We then advance to “Van Eck Phreaking” style attacks against individual keystroke emanations as well as RF wireless connections, and we finally graduate to the new hotness: acoustic attacks by eavesdropping on the sound of you typing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your newfound knowledge for good, with great power comes great responsibility!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subset of signal leak attacks focusing on keyboards. This talk is compiled with open sources, no classified material will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OAuth tokens are the new crown jewels. Once issued, they bypass MFA and give API-level access that is hard to monitor. The opaque nature of their use and the difficulty in monitoring their activity create a dangerous blind spot for security teams, making them a primary target for attackers. This presentation will delve into the lifecycle of OAuth tokens, explore real-world attack vectors, and provide actionable strategies for protecting these high-value assets. We will also review the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of notorious gangs like ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider, as demonstrated in the 2025 Salesforce attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bots generate roughly half of all Internet traffic. Some are clearly malicious (password crackers, vulnerability scanners, application-level/L7 DDoS), and others are merely unwanted (web scrappers, carting, appointment etc) bots. Traditional challenges (CAPTCHAs, JavaScript checks) degrade user experience, and some vendors are deprecating them. An alternative is traffic and behavior analytics, which is much more sophisticated, but can be far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters, there are cloud services not only helping to bypass challenges, but also mimic browsers and human behavior. It's tough to build a solid protection system withstand such proxy services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present WebShield, a small open-source Python daemon that analyzes Tempesta FW, an open-source web accelerator, access logs and dynamically classifies and blocks bad bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn:
* Which bots are easy to detect (e.g., L7 DDoS, password crackers) and which are harder (e.g., scrapers, carting/checkout abuse).
* Why your secret weapon is your users’ access patterns and traffic statistics—and how to use them.
* How to efficiently deliver web-server access logs to an analytics database (e.g., ClickHouse).
* Traffic fingerprints (JA3, JA4, p0f): how they’re computed and their applicability for machine learning
* Tempesta Fingerprints: lightweight fingerprints designed for automatic web clients clustering.
* How to correlate multiple traffic characteristics and catch lazy bot developers.
* Baseline models for access-log analytics and how to validate them.
* How to block large botnets without blocking half the Internet.
* Scoring, behavioral analysis, and other advanced techniques are not yet implemented&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Finding backdoors with fuzzing</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="security">Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backdoors in software are real&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve seen injections creep into open-source projects more than once. Remember the infamous xz backdoor? That was just the headline act. Before that, we have seen the PHP backdoor (2021), vsFTPd (CVE-2011-2523), and ProFTPD (CVE-2010-20103). And it doesn’t stop at open-source projects: network daemons baked into router firmware have been caught red-handed too—think Belkin F9K1102, D-Link DIR-100, and Tenda W302R. Spoiler alert: this is likely just the tip of the iceberg. &lt;strong&gt;Why is this so scary?&lt;/strong&gt; Because a single backdoor in a popular open-source project or router model is basically an all-you-can-eat buffet for attackers—millions of systems served on a silver platter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding and neutralizing backdoors means digging deep into large codebases&lt;/strong&gt; and binary firmware. Sounds heroic, right? In practice, even for a seasoned analyst armed with reverse-engineering tools (and maybe a good Belgian beer), it’s a royal pain. So painful that, honestly, &lt;strong&gt;almost nobody does it&lt;/strong&gt;. Some brave souls tried building specialized reverse tools—Firmalice, HumIDIFy, Stringer, Weasel—but those projects have been gathering dust for years. And when we tested Stringer (which hunts for hard-coded strings that might trigger backdoors), the results were… let’s say “meh”: tons of noise, so many missed hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is where ROSA (&lt;a href="https://github.com/binsec/rosa"&gt;https://github.com/binsec/rosa&lt;/a&gt;) comes in&lt;/strong&gt;. Our mission? Make backdoor detection practical enough that people actually want to do it—no Belgian beer required (but appreciated!).
Our secret weapon: fuzzing. Standard fuzzers like AFL++ (&lt;a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus"&gt;https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus&lt;/a&gt;) bombard programs with massive input sets to make them crash. It’s brute force, but it works wonders for memory-safety bugs. Backdoors, though, play a different game: they don’t crash—they hide behind secret triggers and valid behaviors.
So &lt;strong&gt;we built a mechanism that teaches fuzzers to spot the difference between “normal” and “backdoored” behavior&lt;/strong&gt;. We integrated it into AFL++, and guess what? &lt;strong&gt;It nailed 7 real-world backdoors and 10 synthetic ones in our tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this talk&lt;/strong&gt;, we’d like to show you how ROSA works, demo it live, and share ideas for making it even better. If you’re into fuzzing, reverse engineering, or just love geeking out over security, you’re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://landlock.io"&gt;Landlock&lt;/a&gt; is a Linux Security Module that empowers unprivileged processes to securely restrict their own access rights (e.g., filesystem, network). While Landlock provides powerful kernel primitives, using it typically requires modifying application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/landlock-lsm/island"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; makes Landlock practical for everyday workflows by acting as a high-level wrapper and policy manager. Developed alongside the kernel feature and its Rust libraries, it bridges the gap between raw security mechanisms and user activity through:
- Zero-code integration: Runs existing binaries without modification.
- Declarative policies: Uses TOML profiles instead of code-based rules.
- Context-aware activation: Automatically applies security profiles based on your current working directory.
- Full environment isolation: Manages isolated workspaces (XDG directories, TMPDIR) in addition to access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will provide a brief overview of the related kernel mechanisms before diving into Island. We'll explain the main differences with other mechanisms and tools, and we'll explain Island's design and how it works, with a demo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/capslock"&gt;Capslock project&lt;/a&gt; was started within Google to provide a capability analysis toolkit for Go packages, and has since been open sourced and is being extended to support other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll walk through using the experimental &lt;a href="https://github.com/LawnGnome/cargo-capslock"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo-capslock&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool developed through a grant from &lt;a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/"&gt;Alpha-Omega&lt;/a&gt; to analyse the capabilities of Rust services. We'll then use the result of that analysis to create seccomp profiles that can be applied using container orchestration systems (such as Kubernetes) to restrict services and ensure that updates are unable to silently open new attack vectors, and discuss how this technique can be applied to services written in other languages as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Open-Weight Dilemma: Mitigating AI Cyber Risks Without Killing Open Source</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open-weight LLMs (like LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek-R1) have triggered a "Cambrian explosion" of innovation, but they have also democratized offensive cyber capabilities. Recent evaluations, such as MITRE’s OCCULT framework, show that publicly available models can now achieve &amp;gt;90% success rates on offensive cyber knowledge tests, enabling targeted phishing, malware polymorphism, and vulnerability discovery at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Open Source community, this presents an existential crisis. Traditional security models (API gating, monitoring, rate limiting) rely on centralized control, which vanishes the moment weights are published. Furthermore, emerging regulations like the EU AI Act risk imposing impossible compliance burdens on open model developers for downstream misuse they cannot control, such as post-market monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Alfonso De Gregorio (Pwnshow) will deconstruct the "Mitigation Gap"—the technical reality that once a model is downloaded, safety filters can be trivially fine-tuned away. Drawing on his direct consultation work with the European Commission, he will explain how we can navigate this minefield. We will discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ The Threat Reality: A look at tools like Xanthorox AI and DeepSeek-R1 to understand the actual offensive capabilities of current open weights, and the state of the art in offensive AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ The Policy Trap: Why "strict" interpretations of the EU AI Act could stifle open innovation, and the fight to shift liability to the modifier and deployer rather than the open-source developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ The Way Forward: Technical solutions for "Responsible Release" (Model Cards, capability evaluations) and the necessity of AI-enabled defenses to counterbalance the offensive drop in barrier-to-entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is for security practitioners and open-source advocates who want to ensure the future of AI remains open, while pragmatically addressing the security chaos it unleashes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Supply chain security meets AI: Detecting AI-generated code</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone's excited (sarcasm) that AI coding tools make developers more productive. Security teams are excited too - they've never had this much job security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLMs and AI-assisted coding tools are writing billions of lines of code, so teams can ship 10x faster. They're also inheriting vulnerabilities 10x faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to detect AI-generated code and trace it back to its FOSS origins. The challenge: exact matching doesn't work for AI-generated code since each generation may have small variations given the same input prompt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI-Generated Code Search (https://github.com/aboutcode-org/ai-gen-code-search) introduces a new approach using locality-sensitive hashing and content-defined chunking for approximate matching that actually works with AI output variations. This FOSS project delivers reusable open source libraries, public APIs, and open datasets that make AI code detection accessible to everyone, not just enterprises with massive budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explain how we fingerprint code fragments for fuzzy matching, build efficient indexes that don't balloon to terabytes, and trace AI-generated snippets back to their training data sources. We'll demo real examples of inherited vulnerabilities, show how it integrates with existing FOSS tools for SBOM and supply chain analysis, and explain how this directly supports CRA compliance for tracking code origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: if AI-generated code is in your dependencies (and it probably is), you need visibility into what it's derived from and what risks it carries. This project gives you the FOSS tools and data to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AI Security Monitoring: Detecting Threats Against Production ML Systems</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Your AI model is a new attack surface!  Unlike traditional applications where threats are well-documented, ML systems face unique vulnerabilities: adversarial inputs crafted to fool classifiers, data poisoning during training, prompt injection in LLM applications, model extraction through API probing, and membership inference attacks that leak training data.
Most security teams monitor network traffic and system logs. Few monitor the AI layer itself. This talk shows how to build security-focused observability for production ML systems using open source tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll demonstrate during the track 3 Threat detection patterns:
1. Adversarial input detection
2. Model behavior monitoring
3. LLM-specific security monitoring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everything.... with a fully open source. stack
Prometheus for metrics (custom security-focused exporters)
Loki for structured logging with retention policies
Grafana for security dashboards and alerting
OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with the following materials:
Threat model framework for production ML systems
Prometheus alerting rules for common AI attack patterns
Log analysis queries for security investigation
Architecture for integrating AI monitoring with existing SOC workflows&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Zero Trust in Action: Architecting Secure Systems Beyond Perimeters</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats grow in sophistication, the “trust but verify” model is no longer enough. Organizations are rapidly shifting toward Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) — a security paradigm where no user or device is inherently trusted, inside or outside the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is no longer a buzzword—it’s a necessity. With traditional perimeter-based security models failing to address modern threats like lateral movement and insider attacks, organizations are increasingly adopting ZTA’s "never trust, always verify" philosophy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture is built on several pillars: 
  -  Identity-centric protection defining identity as the new perimeter. 
  -  Dynamic micro segmentation and contextual access controls to isolate resources. 
  -  Continuous monitoring and behavioural analytics to detect sophisticated lateral movements and insider threats. 
Modern ZTA implementations employ AI and automation for adaptive threat detection and response, dramatically reducing breach costs and attack surfaces for distributed enterprises. Adoption of Zero Trust is rapidly increasing, with industry research indicating that over 70% of organizations are integrating ZTA in their cybersecurity frameworks and at least 70% of new remote access deployments will rely on these principles by the end of 2025. Despite its robust security benefits, ZTA demands substantial investment in identity management, policy enforcement, and ongoing operational monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we move from theoretical principles to practical implementation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the why and how of ZTA adoption for mid-level engineers and security practitioners. We’ll break down core ZTA components—identity-centric access, micro segmentation, and continuous monitoring—using real-world examples . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with: 
•  A clear roadmap for phased ZTA adoption, starting with high-value assets. 
•  Strategies to balance security and user experience (e.g., just-in-time access). 
•  Lessons from industry leaders like IBM on overcoming common pitfalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re in DevOps, cloud security, or IT governance, this session will equip you to champion ZTA in your organization&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Legal and licensing issues are a vital part of the Free Software ecosystem. While many Free Software developers may have a good idea of the legal and licensing requirements that turn their project into Free Software, there are many more attending FOSDEM who may lack the knowledge or have misconceptions about the legal issues in Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session hopes to provide an introduction and background to the legal concepts that underpin the freedoms in Free Software, and how the law is an important tool in ensuring our digital freedoms, so that participants can better appreciate the legal and licensing issues to be discussed by speakers in the Legal and Policy Devroom.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open protocols underpin much of Europe’s digital infrastructure, yet they remain a blind spot in European digital policy. This talk highlights why supporting open protocol governance is crucial for Europe’s digital sovereignty, interoperability, and innovation. It explores how policymakers and developers can together address this gap by recognising protocols as foundational infrastructure and shaping policies that enable resilient, interoperable, and decentralised systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>From Policy To Practice; Open Source in The Dutch Government</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2020 the Dutch government adopted the 'open, unless' principle, promoting the use and procurement of open source software, unless impossible. But what happens after such a policy is published? This isn’t as straightforward as we’d think. Within government projects, we still regularly need to answer practical questions such as “are we allowed to build or buy this? Are we allowed or required to publish our code? What do we need security wise? What do our procurement policies say? Where do we put the code? Does code need to be archived like documents? How do we collaborate with other government tenants? And how do we support the open source communities whose code we use?” The ‘open, unless’ principle is clear on paper, but applying it turns out to be more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will look at how the Dutch are putting 'open, unless' into practice inside the Ministry of the Interior (BZK), through the daily work of our Open Source Program Office (OSPO). Instead of focusing on just policy, the focus is on the operational side. Once the choice for open source is made, what challenges arise then? This will be illustrated with concrete project examples. The first is MijnBureau, a sovereign open source workspace for the government, that has been built openly from the start. The second example is the Dutch Government Codeplatform, a shared development environment, based on Forgejo. A third example is OpenKat, a collectively built open source vulnerability scanner. Together we’ll explore how 'open, unless' is applied in a consistent way (spoiler alert: it’s not). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show what “from policy to practice” actually looks like for the public-sector. For instance, many open source projects start bottom-up. How do we ensure proper top-down alignment with national strategies, adequate funding and sponsorship? When a project is done, who is going to manage and maintain it? How do we make sure we don’t take advantage of open source communities? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at anyone interested in public-sector open source, OSPOs, procurement and policy implementation, or in understanding why “just publish code” is rarely as easy as it sounds, and what we can do to make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source initiatives usually bubble up from the grassroots community, and while governments have been paying more attention recently, policy is often subject to the whims of election cycles. This means long-term continuity is never guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when policies are in place, their implementation can be hampered by two significant factors: civil servants' open-source literacy and existing legal/regulatory bottlenecks. Sure, enshrining open source into law would make it mandatory and sustainable, but let’s be real—the legislative process is painfully slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Culture Foundation (OCF) has been deeply embedded in Taiwan’s open source scene for over a decade. Some of our members have been tracking the government’s on-again, off-again open-source journey for nearly 30 years, since the early community days. Others have even moved from leading government open-source policy to eventually return to the non-profit sector. Throughout this journey, OCF has continually adapted how we collaborate with and support the government, seeking the best communication strategies and case studies—all while managing the inevitable cycles of disappointment and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, we saw Audrey Tang depart from the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA), and the government's visible focus on open source has noticeably dialed down. However, we also found like-minded partners in the Taipei City Government's Department of Information Technology (DOIT). We are now working with them to ensure that open source software continues to be adopted and deployed within the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this 30-minute session, we’ll be sharing the different collaboration models we’ve developed with the government and the tangible deliverables we’ve produced. Crucially, we’ll also discuss how we keep the momentum going and move forward even when we face headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) sued Vizio in October 2021 because Vizio did not provide the required source code for the GPL and LGPL works that Vizio chose to use in its TVs, preventing SFC from making privacy and security enhancing changes, among other improvements that the GPL and LGPL require that companies allow in devices they sell.  SFC brought the case as a third-party beneficiary of these copyleft agreements, to demonstrate how users of copylefted software can directly enforce the agreements if a company fails to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case finally made it to trial two weeks ago, after several long years of negotiation, hearings, and source candidate reviews.  Join us to learn how that long-awaited trial went: what the arguments were, how Vizio tried to make its case, and what the likely outcomes may be, both for Vizio and for software freedom as a whole.  We look forward to your questions and discussion around this historic case for user rights!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>"Online Safety" laws: reflections for FOSS projects</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="legal">Legal &amp; Policy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A number of countries are introducing "online safety" laws, which generally impact providers of online services. An example of these is the UK's Online Safety Act 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It purports to have extra-territorial effect, applying to anyone, anywhere in the world, who provides a service to people in the UK, if certain criteria are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ostensible aim of these acts is to address concerns relating to the largest social media providers, they are not always well drafted, or else are drafted intentionally broadly, and catch all number of services which are used commonly by FOSS projects, including self-hosted projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git / code forges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;community forums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instant messaging services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bug trackers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent far too much pro bono time this year working with FOSS projects to help them with the Online Safety Act 2023, working out whether it poses a realistic risk to them, and what, if anything, they might want to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also produced onlinesafetyact.co.uk, as a free, CC-licensed, resource, which has been well used as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raise awareness of this kind of legal framework, which is likely to be increasingly common&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cover the assessment of risk, to help projects decide which, if any, requirements might pose actual risk to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at options for "doing something" which, while perhaps not compliant with each and every law, might be heading in the right direction, consistent with the generally reasonably common aims of this kind of framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discuss some of the benefits of thinking through these kinds of issue, so that it is not just about "legal compliance", but whether there are learnings / things to do which can actually make communities safer and give projects less work to do overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This panel will bring together policy/legal experts and enforcement officers from the European Commission to discuss how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) applies to Apple’s iOS/iPadOS and Google’s Android from the perspective of interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the panel will deal with the European Commission's recent decisions in regulating hardware and software interoperability for Apple’s OSes. The audience will learn what interoperability under the DMA means for Free Software developers, and how they can expect the interoperability solutions to be provided by gatekeeper companies like Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the discussion will address relevant questions for the effective implementation of the interoperability obligations in the DMA, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can Free Software projects request interoperability from Apple and Google under the DMA? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the integrity of the operating system concerns involving interoperability grants under the DMA? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the security concerns related to interoperability? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the main challenges posed by changes in governance for the Android Open Source Project? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other DMA obligations can Free Software developers rely on to facilitate switching, specially related to data interoperability and portability?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the consequences if Apple and Google fail to interoperate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the DMA effectively shift gatekeeper control away from Apple and Google? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What regulatory or community responses, at both the European and global levels, are needed to preserve software freedom in the mobile ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel will be composed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lori Roussey, Data Rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Victor Le Pochat, European Commission's DMA enforcement team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gabriel Kobus, European Commission's DMA enforcement team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexander Matern, European Commission's DMA enforcement team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel will be moderated by Lucas Lasota, Legal Researcher and Lecturer at the Halle-Wittenberg University. The language will be English.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Copyleft for the next Decade: My cunning Plan</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk details the currently-planned litigation strategy of FOSS Users e.V. (https://foss-users.eu) for the next decade. We are also looking for the community for feedback on other possible strategies. The first part of our current strategy is to get precedent that copyleft violations can be pursued with injunctions against consumer rights infringements in Germany. This is best done with the most obvious violation first: lock down of LGPLed libraries. The next issue will be proprietary Linux kernel modules using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPLed interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk wants to explore the options we, as a community, have to safeguard copyleft and software freedom.
To this end, the talk takes a two-pronged approach. First, it calls on the community to come up with clever ideas about how to enforce copyleft licenses and protect our commons from more and more savvy and blatant violators. Second, the main part of the talk will be to present my ideas so far on how we should move forward in the next decade. Subject to community feeback on these ideas, I propose that we frame copyleft violations as consumer rights infringements and have a consumer association getting injunctions against these infringements. More broadly speaking, we need a community of hobby legal experts taking the burden from the developers to enforce copyleft. If these hobbyists pursue violations in a rewarding way, they can sustainably take on the task of enforcing the developers' will.
The presentation will conclude with discussion of how the audience can contribute. First, they could become members of the consumers association already incorporated in Germany, of FOSS Users e.V. . Under German law, consumers associations need at least 75 members to be allowed to sue. Second, they could donate money for copyleft enforcement. Third, they could make suggestions for improvements to the plan and contribute new ideas to incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Unique Challenges in Elected Governing Bodies for FOSS</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FOSS communities have historically developed governance models that include within them biases and other problems, often belatedly recognized. For example, there is now general agreement  that no dictator can be benevolent. Common alternatives to the "benevolent" dictator— the "meritocracy", "do-acracy", and the self-perpetuating committee — also have serious problems. Often the alternative offered to these kinds of governance systems is for some kind of elected governance body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic governance institutions are messy, however.  We'll consider some historical examples of problems that have occurred in various democratic FOSS initiatives and organizations, and will focus particularly on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) board of directors elections of 2025. We'll  consider the question: how can we design elected governance bodies for FOSS that truly represent the views of our community and are held properly accountable to their constituencies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier will moderate this panel, and additional individuals have been invited and will be added once they are confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Clean-room design is a method of recreating and relicensing software without infringing any of the copyrights. So what happens when we use LLM's to recreate thousands of open source projects in seconds, and relicense them all to more permissive licenses? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first started looking at this when in 2025 MongoDB used an AI agent to take thousands of lines of code from a copyleft project, and used Cursor to recreate and relicense it all under apache. The prompts used to do this were left in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for the open source ecosystem that 90% of our open source supply chain can currently be recreated in seconds with today's AI agents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will be demonstrating the process of large scale clean rooming, and explore what it means for open source, and what it means for community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;llama.cpp has become a key tool for running LLMs efficiently on any hardware. This talk explores how multimodal features have grown in the project. It focuses on libmtmd, a library added in April 2025 to make multimodal support easier to use and to maintain in llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will first cover main achievements. These include combining separate CLI tools for different models into one single tool called llama-mtmd-cli. Next, we will discuss how libmtmd works with llama-server and show real examples of low-latency OCR applications. We will also talk about adding audio support, which lets newer models summarize audio inputs. Plus, we will cover the challenges of handling legacy code while keeping the project flexible for future models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the talk will share plans for new features like video input, text-to-speech support, and image generation. Attendees will also learn how to contribute and use these multimodal tools in their own project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>API Remoting for llama.cpp: Near-Native GPU Speed in macOS Containers</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="ai">AI Plumbers</track>
        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Running modern Large Language Model (LLM) workloads on macOS presents a unique challenge: reconciling powerful local hardware with a mature, Linux-first AI tooling and container ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem: Bridging the OS and Acceleration Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While containerization offers macOS developers access to Linux-centric tools like Ramalama and the Podman Desktop AI Lab, introducing a virtualization layer immediately compromises GPU acceleration. Direct device passthrough is infeasible, as it monopolizes the display and host system resources. Consequently, achieving high-performance LLM inference requires a sophisticated bridging mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Solution: Para-Virtualization via GGML API Remoting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the implementation of an &lt;strong&gt;API-remoting, para-virtualized execution path for llama.cpp&lt;/strong&gt;. This novel design is built directly on the &lt;strong&gt;GGML API&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing us to selectively offload compute-intensive operations to execute on the macOS host. Crucially, this execution path &lt;strong&gt;natively leverages the GGML-Metal backend&lt;/strong&gt;, achieving &lt;strong&gt;full-speed host performance&lt;/strong&gt;.
This strategy preserves a fully containerized Linux developer experience inside the virtual machine while achieving hardware-level acceleration outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance and Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will share concrete performance results demonstrating near-native inference speed compared to running llama.cpp directly on the host. The talk will examine the architectural trade-offs of this split-execution model, providing insight into:
* The implementation details of the para-virtualized GGML API bridge.
* The latency overhead of API remoting versus the throughput gain from host GPU execution.
* How this open-source approach fundamentally changes the future of containerized and accelerated AI tooling on non-Linux platforms, specifically addressing the needs of macOS users in the open-source AI community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deploying neural networks in production environments presents unique challenges: models must run efficiently across diverse hardware, from powerful servers to resource-constrained embedded devices, while maintaining predictable performance without heavy runtime dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces &lt;a href="https://github.com/sonos/tract"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sonos.com/"&gt;Sonos&lt;/a&gt;'s open-source neural network inference toolkit started in 2018 and written in Rust. We'll explore how tract bridges the gap between training frameworks and production deployment by offering a no-nonsense, self-contained inference solution used today to deploy deep learning on millions of devices at Sonos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This toolkit has some unique strengths thanks to embedded graph optimization, automated streaming management, and symbolic abstraction for dynamic dimensions — plus support for multiple open exchange standards including &lt;a href="https://onnx.ai/"&gt;ONNX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.khronos.org/nnef"&gt;NNEF&lt;/a&gt;, and TensorFlow Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sonos/tract"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also has a companion project coined &lt;a href="https://github.com/sonos/torch-to-nnef"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;torch-to-nnef&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that strive to export PyTorch models to an NNEF optimized for tract with maximum compatibility. It enables some unique features like quantization, better Fourier Transform support and easier extensibility: this will also be discussed shortly during this presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Can an ESP32-based MCU run (tiny)ML models accurately and efficiently? This talk showcases how a tiny microcontroller can transparently leverage neighboring nodes to run inference on full, unquantized torchvision models in less than 100ms! We build on vAccel, an open abstraction layer that allows interoperable hardware acceleration and enable devices like the ESP32 to transparently offload ML inference and signal-processing tasks to nearby edge or cloud nodes. Through a lightweight agent and a unified API, vAccel bridges heterogeneous devices, enabling seamless offload without modifying application logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session presents our IoT port of vAccel (client &amp;amp; lightweight agent) and demonstrates a real deployment where an ESP32 delegates inference to a GPU-backed k8s node, reducing latency by 3 orders of magnitude while preserving Kubernetes-native control and observability. Attendees will see how open acceleration can unify the Cloud–Edge–IoT stack through standard interfaces and reusable runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As AI workloads move to the browser, the lack of a unified low-level acceleration layer on Linux—equivalent to DirectML or CoreML—creates major bottlenecks. In this talk, we explore how WebNN and next-generation WebLLM can unlock efficient on-device inference on RISC-V, using Tenstorrent hardware and the emerging RVV 1.0 Variable-Length vector ISA. We cover the challenges of WebNN integration on Linux, the importance of WASM support for RVV, and demonstrate progress on running modern LLMs directly in the browser. We will also detail the RVV-enabled WASM implementation path for WebNN and what’s needed upstream.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

With a single-source approach we aim to minimize backend-specific code and foster community participation by writing inference kernels once and run them everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>One GPU, Many Models: What Works and What Segfaults</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Serving multiple models on a single GPU sounds great until something segfaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two approaches dominate for parallel inference: MIG (hardware partitioning) and MPS (software sharing). Both promise efficient GPU sharing. Both have trade-offs and their behavior changes based on GPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested both strategies on Hopper and Blackwell, running diffusion, MoE, and TTS workloads in parallel. Some setups survived. Others didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk digs into what actually happened: where memory isolation falls apart, which configs crash, and what survives under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end, you'll know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to utilize unused GPU capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to setup MIG and MPS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How MIG and MPS behave under actual load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory issues, crashes, and failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which config is suited best for your AI workload.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Adventures in Model Quantization" continues to quest to run high quality models with minimal hardware resources. In this edition, community quantizer John Leimgruber ("ubergarm" on huggingface), tells the story of how a single line change to llama.cpp enabled the 1000B open weights model Kimi-K2-Thinking to maintain full quality while using only half the memory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents an overview and visualizations of llama.cpp quantization types and discuses how Quantization Aware Training (QAT) effects mapping models across ecosystems from transformers' safetensors into llama.cpp GGUF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in running the best open-weights LLMs and ai models on gaming rigs, home-lab servers, or privately for your organization, then come learn how to benchmark both quality and speed for all the huggingface quants available for ik/llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an updated presentation expanding upon a recent AI Plumber's talk given in October 2025 in San Fransisco:&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most Machine Learning tools use CUDA for hardware acceleration, and are as a result only compatible with Nvidia GPUs. AMD has been making a lot of progress enabling simple recompilation with minimal code changes to ROCm for their hardware, but why not use an open and broadly-compatible API instead? That's where Vulkan comes in, which was built up for game development, but also allows compute-only applications, and has broad and good driver support across many hardware vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to last year's talk about my work on the llama.cpp/GGML Vulkan backend, this talk will discuss lessons learnt from optimizations and new features that we added since, how viable Vulkan is for Machine Learning and what it is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Running various forms of inference on microcontroller NPUs is not new. Systems where machine learning is used to analyze sensor data or do light CV  on microcontroller-grade systems under 1 watt, under few dozen MB of RAM and FLASH and under 10 USD bill-of-materials are being massively deployed (even if they stay in the long shadow of more flashy LLMs and GenAI). That area, however, historically has been a domain of specialized machine learning frameworks such as emlearn, LiteRT (artist formerly known as TensorFlow Lite) and a few others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I will try to answer in this talk is the following: are there any benefits of trying to use more well established, but still pretty tightly optimized frameworks such as ggml and tinygrad for these types of deployments. I will share my experience with adopting these frameworks to targets such as Google Coral NPU and AI Foundry Erbium and what kind of interesting challenges it presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Data Lakes for AI: Open Table Formats as the Foundation</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, organizations are increasingly relying on data lakehouses to store, process, and analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. The path from raw data to a production-ready AI model is complex, often bottlenecked by data inconsistencies, schema drift, and a lack of data versioning. In the spirit of open source AI hacking, the focus must shift to ensuring the underlying data infrastructure is as reliable and reproducible as the models themselves.
This presentation addresses the critical role of Open Table Formats (OTFs)—specifically Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Apache Hudi—in transforming unstructured data lakes into reliable, queryable data lakehouses. OTFs provide database-like capabilities, including ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel, directly on low-cost object storage
The talk will provide a practical overview of integrating open-source OTFs with popular AI/ML frameworks, empowering "AI Plumbers" to build robust, governed, and highly performant data foundations for their next generation of open-source models&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The growing energy demands of modern AI models pose a significant barrier to sustainable computing. As model complexity and deployment scale continue to rise, training and inference increasingly contribute to carbon emissions and operational costs. This talk begins by examining the technical challenges of accurately measuring energy consumption at multiple levels of abstraction—from system-wide and process-level metrics down to individual source code methods and API calls. Practical strategies for overcoming these measurement hurdles are discussed.
The second part of the talk explores power consumption patterns in GPU kernels, highlighting how thread configuration, block geometry, and power limit settings shape kernel-level energy efficiency. We demonstrate how these characteristics influence power draw and discuss techniques for predicting consumption based on kernel properties. The session concludes with insights and best practices for managing performance–energy trade-offs in GPU-accelerated AI applications, offering a path toward more sustainable AI development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Silicon engineering seems unobtainable elite industry only for those veterans of the industry that have access to expensive instruments and years of experience, right? Well, not anymore! With AI tools, coding agents and more and more available substrate to hook them up to, you can approach it as a system design, and start in days! Make new models inference on novel accelerator cards, put open cores in FPGA, and other tricks you can do without specialized engineering degrees. Not suggesting to tape it out and put it in production without proper review, but for prototyping and faster feedback cycles it's really changing the game! I'll demo a couple of examples all based on open IP!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Taming the LLM Zoo with Docker Model Runner: Inference with OCI Artifacts, llama.cpp, and vLLM</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Running LLMs is currently fraught with friction: dependency hell and the ungoverned management of massive weight files (GGUF, safetensors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce Docker Model Runner (DMR), an open initiative to bring the same standard of reproducibility to AI models that containers brought to code. We will explore how DMR streamlines the "pull, push, run, serve" lifecycle by treating AI models as first-class OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifacts, decoupling the model weights from the inference engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will dive deep into the architecture of the Docker Model Runner, covering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models as Artifacts: How we package and distribute GGUF and safetensors formats using OCI-compliant registries, eliminating the need for arbitrary file downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Unified Interface: How DMR abstracts the complexity of underlying inference backends. We will discuss the integration of llama.cpp for broad hardware compatibility (CPU/GPU) and vLLM for high-performance production serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Model Driver Pack: How the runner handles hardware acceleration automatically, managing the interface between the container runtime and host resources (NVIDIA CUDA, Vulkan, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Experience: A look at the docker model CLI plugin and the local REST API that allows developers to swap models without changing their client code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us to see how we are building a standardized, open ecosystem where docker model run ai/gemma3 is all you need to start building AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways for the Review Committee (Why this fits FOSDEM):
Open Standards: The talk focuses on OCI compliance and open weights (GGUF/safetensors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source Integration: It highlights the usage and orchestration of popular open-source projects (llama.cpp and vLLM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical Depth: It addresses infrastructure challenges (GPU passthrough, artifact management) rather than just high-level AI concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I shared Paddler, an open-source LLM load balancer. A year of community feedback and building Poet (a static site generator with AI features) on top of it taught me what actually matters when self-hosting LLMs. This talk shares practical patterns the open-source community needs. What works, what doesn't, and what tooling we still need to build together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The ET-SoC-1 chip contains more than one thousand RISC-V cores, with custom vector and tensor extensions on each core, and has recently been given a new open-source lease of life [1]. What do low-level AI software engineers do with novel hardware? Obviously the answer is to make it do matmuls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me on a rapid journey from naïve matmul to optimized matmul, learning about ET-SoC-1 along the way. Some of its hardware features will help us, whereas others will be a hinderance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>All in RISC-V, RISC-V All in AI: Solving Real AI Compute Challenges with DeepComputing &amp; Tenstorrent</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is rapidly evolving into a serious platform for AI acceleration—from embedded devices to full AI PCs and datacenter-class compute. But building real, production-ready AI systems on open hardware still poses challenges: memory bandwidth bottlenecks, heterogeneous compute scheduling, toolchain maturity, and model deployment efficiency. As part of this session, we will also briefly share DeepComputing’s AI product roadmap to illustrate how these engineering breakthroughs translate into real devices.
In this talk, engineers from DeepComputing and Tenstorrent will share how we are solving these challenges together across two ends of the computing spectrum:
    • AI PC / edge devices:
How we integrate high-performance RISC-V CPUs with NPUs, optimize dataflow for multi-die architectures, and overcome compiler/runtime fragmentation to run LLMs locally.
    • AI servers:
How Tenstorrent’s RISC-V cores and scalable mesh architecture handle AI workloads; how we bridge the software gap (compilers, toolchains, scheduling, kernel-level tuning); and how we standardize low-level interfaces for AI compute.
The focus is on how these problems are solved—microarchitecture decisions, data movement, kernel optimizations, interoperability layers, and lessons learned from building real products. This session will show why “All in RISC-V, RISC-V All in AI” is no longer a slogan but a practical engineering path forward.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the last 10 years there's been a hardware race to build the best application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for both machine learning training and inference i.e. AI accelerators. What started with vision processing units (VPUs) went through tensor PUs (TPUs) and now we are dealing with neural processing units (NPUs). What's next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will take a systematic look at the different hardware platforms for AI acceleration, but with a focus on the software stacks that support them on Linux. We'll take a look how individual vendors approached their ASICs from the kernel side, and how they exposed the acceleration functionality for user-space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it all proprietary or is there liberté? We'll find out together!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For nearly a decade, Open Collective has served as the financial and legal infrastructure for over 3,000 open source projects, managing millions in funding. However, for much of that history, the platform itself was owned by Venture Capitalists a tension that sits at the heart of the FOSS funding conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we reveal how the platform’s largest users, specifically the Open Source Collective—orchestrated a coup to boot out the initial investors and restructure the entity into a 501(c)(6) membership non-profit - Open Finance Consortium (https://oficonsortium.org/). This is a case study in "Exit to Community" (E2C), demonstrating a radical alternative to the traditional startup exit that often threatens FOSS sustainability. https://blog.opencollective.com/the-open-collective-platform-is-moving-to-a-community-governed-non-profit/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will move beyond the celebration of the acquisition to discuss the hard realities that followed. It is one thing to "free" a platform; it is another to sustain it. We will explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Negotiation: How a Fiscal Host leveraged its position to facilitate a transition from private equity to community ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governance vs. Reality: The evolution of our shared governance model and the difficulty of putting democratic ideals into practice while running a complex tech stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financials: The transparent challenges of achieving financial sustainability without the cushion of VC cash flow, and what was sacrificed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is for maintainers, funders, and policymakers interested in the structural future of FOSS infrastructure. We offer not just a success story, but a candid look at the friction involved in building a technology platform that is truly owned by the ecosystem it serves.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Procurement Is the Biggest Form of Fundraising for FLOSS</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free software has no shortage of talent, ideas, or users, but it does have a funding problem. The largest potential funding source already exists: public procurement. Governments spend billions each year on software and digital services, but most of that money flows into proprietary silos that limit transparency, reuse, and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take “Public Money, Public Code” - https://publiccode.eu -  seriously, we must recognize that procurement (not donations or sponsorships) is the most powerful lever to sustain open source. Every government contract is a potential long-term investment in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk examines how procurement practices can become the backbone of sustainable free software ecosystems:
    •   Why procurement reform is essential to digital sovereignty.
    •   How existing frameworks (e.g., the EU Open Source Strategy - https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/digital-services/open-source-software-strategy_en ) still fall short.
    •   How to structure tenders, contracts, and governance to ensure open deliverables.
    •   Why governments should stop “buying software” and start funding maintenance and collaboration.
    •   The opportunity for community organizations and small firms to compete fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procurement is where ideals meet infrastructure. By redirecting even a small fraction of public IT budgets toward open, reusable solutions, we can achieve what years of advocacy and fundraising have not: a self-sustaining free software ecosystem that serves everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is a call-to-action to join our campaign to convince the European Union that, in order to secure its digital future,  it should invest in open source maintenance via an EU Sovereign Tech Fund (EU-STF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the EU is negotiating its multi-year budget for the period of 2028-2034. Traditionally, the EU budget has been focused on regional development and agriculture, but more and more policymakers are realizing that investment in our digital infrastructure is just as important as maintaining physical roads and bridges. Last year at FOSDEM, we discussed with you what an EU fund for open source maintenance should look like. A lot has happened since then: We have conducted an in-depth study into the political, legal and economic feasibility of an EU-STF, building on the successful example of the German Sovereign Tech Agency. We assembled a coalition of supporters from industry and civil society, and we have presented our proposal to the European Parliament and Member States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to take the campaign to the next level and we need your support to make it happen. The goal of this session is to present the findings of the feasibility study for the EU-STF and demonstrate why mission-driven investment, coordinated by the public sector, is important for the diversification of Europe’s funding landscape. It will demonstrate concretely how such a proposal can directly improve the sustainability and health of the open source community globally, and why this is so important for Europe in achieving its digital future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is a session combining the experience of several FOSS projects in their funding journey. Each will have 10 minutes to present, after which a Q&amp;amp;A session will happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenting FOSS projects will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mockoon is a popular open-source API tool, built and maintained from Luxembourg. In this talk, its creator shares the journey of growing a developer tool used by thousands, without external funding. Learn what worked (and didn't) in the pursuit of sustainability through sponsorships, community, and a cloud SaaS offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuckDB is the fastest growing data management tool to date. Meanwhile, DuckDB is Free and Open Source Software under the permissive MIT license.  DuckDB's development began inside an academic instituted funded by grants. We then moved to a bootstrapped spin-off and have been running ever since.  In my short talk, I will describe the meandering route and mental processes that lead us to choose this funding model, the things we do and why we do them, the things to avoid and why to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the core pillars of the internet, enabling users to navigate the web reliably and securely. However, underfunded open source DNS projects create systemic risks, exposing millions of users to vulnerabilities and threatening the stability and security of the entire internet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nominet DNS Fund aims to tackle these critical gaps by investing in the security, resilience, and long-term viability of these essential open source components, recognising that a robust and secure DNS is fundamental to the internet’s continued operation and the public benefit it provides. Having completed our first round of funding in 2025 and with a view to extending in 2026, this session will share highlights including:
&lt;em&gt;RESEARCH Reflections on revisiting research conducted by Demos that led us to create the fund
&lt;/em&gt;PILOT AND LEARN Analyse some key learning about implementing the fund, including surprises and challenges we face moving forward 
*ITERATE Seek feedback from the devroom in an interactive session to reflect on the fund and shape its future direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to share learning and future direction in open dialogue with the devroom and have ideas about what devroom participants will get out of the session: 
&lt;em&gt;Practical Knowledge: Participants will come away with insight from a real case study of funding OS and delve into some of the learning and challenges
&lt;/em&gt;Conversation points: asking questions such as: How do we better align what's being funded with what's needed? What are the opportunities for better dialogue, feedback and listening? How can applications for funding be more inclusive and accessible?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk, based on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.20210.1"&gt;a paper in &lt;em&gt;Open Research Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will discuss the current state of research software funding, propose a way of thinking about the different models that are currently used, and suggest new models to better support the global research software community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, research software funding operates across a disconnected landscape of public and private grant-making organizations, leading to inefficiencies for software projects and the broader research community. The lack of coordination forces projects to pursue multiple, often overlapping opportunities, and forces funders to independently evaluate projects and proposals, resulting in duplicated effort and suboptimal resource distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining existing collaboration models, including centralized and distributed approaches, we highlight how joint decision-making mechanisms could improve sustainability for reusable software resources. An international set of examples illustrates how cross-organization cooperation for research software funding can be structured. Such collaborations can optimize grant disbursement and align priorities. Increased collaboration could allow funders to better address the ongoing maintenance and evolution of research software, lowering barriers that hamper discovery across multiple research domains. Encouraging both bottom-up user-driven and top-down coordination mechanisms ultimately supports more robust, widely accessible research software, improving global research outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The open source funding landscape is changing. Funders struggle to effectively measure and communicate the impact of their programs beyond case-by-case stories. This disconnect threatens the long-term sustainability of funding and thus the sustainability of FOSS. We spent the last year talking with FOSS funding organizations and grant recipients to understand their approach to grant funding, impact reporting, and FOSS sustainability. We also sought to understand the disconnect between the needs of FOSS projects and what funders can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we share early insights from our interviews. We will share current funder challenges, like differentiating between reactive vs. proactive impact reporting and translating technical outcomes into policy-maker language. Interestingly, we’re are hosting a workshop here at FOSDEM with FOSS funders to co-design on a shared Funding Impact Taxonomy and Measurement Guidelines co-designed. We will share with the audience the the latest learnings and offer a space for further discussion. We may not bring any solutions but we will advance the dialog, so that funders and FOSS projects can better understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As an OSS developer, finding funding is probably the least inspiring high-priority activity on your list of things to do. This session will present concrete steps for the funding task you already have. These will become the tools to find the funding you need. As the Director of Operations at the &lt;a href="https://erlef.org"&gt;Erlang Ecosystem Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and Chair of the Sponsorship Working Group, I'm both a seeker of funding and a reviewer of funding requests. There are no secret handshakes or tricks here, just connecting dots to create a purpose and roadmap that will help. I will cover content you can create to help inform potential sponsors, how to approach them, and the fiscal efficiency of funding methods. The information is based on my own experience working with sponsors and projects, so it is not theoretical but also far from universal or complete.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Funding remains one of the biggest challenges in sustaining free and open source software. In this interactive workshop, we will use the results of a global survey and interview series start a conversation around how developers, users and maintainers think about money in FOSS and what it means for the future of our ecosystem. During the session we will explore donation campaign best practices from FOSS projects, discuss the role transparency and clear policies play in how funds are handled, and give participants an opportunity to learn, contribute, connect and explore how we can help make FOSS more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Ecosystems, Not Projects: Rethinking Open Source Foundation Funding</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source foundations face growing demands, more projects, more users, more scrutiny, while still relying on fragile funding models built around grants, sponsorships, and donations. This talk argues that the problem is not funding open source projects, but funding them in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on experiences from the Apereo and the eBPF Foundations, this session explores a shift from project-centric funding to ecosystem-level investment. Using eBPF as a case study, it shows how funding efforts like security audits, upstream kernel work, directed development, face-to-face collaboration, and ecosystem marketing can strengthen many projects at once and deliver far greater impact per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk also introduces Apereo's self-sustainability model, in which foundations, even projects, support themselves through services rooted in community expertise, such as training, events, audits, and operational support, rather than perpetual fundraising. The goal is not to create more foundations, but ones more focused on ecosystems that are resilient by design, and able to support open source as shared infrastructure rather than a collection of individual projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a wide array of funding and investment directed at open source, enterprise and venture capital funding rarely gets an important slot in European discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as shown in our recent "State of Commercial Open Source" research report of ~800 VC-backed commercial open source (COSS) companies, the virtuous cycle created by enterprise contributions and VC funding not only improves upstream open source projects across virtually every metric but drives thriving commercial ecosystems creating tangible economic and societal value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is clear: while public funding (so far) often functions as early-stage seed capital or a safety net for critical projects, research shows enterprises contributing over $7.7B annually in funding and paid developer time to open source on a global basis. Furthermore there is a big promise in VC funding for open source, also in Europe, with the number and value of transactions rising in recent years, with $26.4B invested in 2024 and strong investment performance indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vertical sectors like finance, energy, telco, and agriculture increasingly embrace open source as a pillar of their digital transformation, it’s clear that commercial open source has become a superior venture model and a strategic opportunity for Europe, but one that requires engaging diverse stakeholders and mutual education on the opportunities at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will share Linux Foundation Europe’s experience of building (and balancing) some of the largest global open source ecosystems as well as Commit’s unique perspective as the first fund solely focused on commercial open source investments in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RISC-V now spans 100+ extensions and over a thousand instructions. Binutils, QEMU, and other projects maintain separate instruction definitions, leading to duplication, mismatches, and slower support of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UDB provides a machine-readable, validated source of truth covering most of the ISA. Our generator currently produces Binutils and QEMU definitions directly from UDB, cutting the effort for standard and custom extension bring-up. And with automated CI checks against current Binutils data, everything stays aligned as the ecosystem evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll show how UDB enables new and custom extension by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating part of of Binutils support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing faster integration on other SW projects like QEMU&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Version 6 of the DWARF debugging information format is still a work in progress, with many changes already accepted.  This talk will focus on one fundamental change that has been accepted recently: "&lt;a href="https://dwarfstd.org/issues/230524.1.html"&gt;Issue 230524.1&lt;/a&gt;", also known as "Location Descriptions on the DWARF Stack".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compiler can emit small programs in a bytecode known as DWARF expressions that a consumer (usually a debugger) can evaluate in order to compute an object's location; where in memory or registers it has been placed.  Up until DWARF-5, the execution model of such DWARF expressions was not expressive enough to describe how objects are placed on GPUs, or even on CPUs in some cases too.  DWARF 6 addresses this by making DWARF locations regular stack elements on the DWARF expression evaluation stack, which has many interesting cascading consequences, including enabling expressiveness, factorization, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will discuss the execution model of DWARF expressions, the proposed changes and follow-up extensions this change enables.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present a &lt;a href="https://github.com/intel/dwarf-evaluator"&gt;DWARF-6 expression evaluator&lt;/a&gt; implemented in OCaml. The evaluator is concise and lightweight. It aims to help tool developers learn and understand DWARF by examining the precise definitions of DWARF operators and by running examples. We believe this will be useful in particular with the "locations on the stack" change that's coming in DWARF-6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluator comes with test cases, which can gradually turn into a reference testsuite. There also exists a &lt;a href="https://barisaktemur.github.io/dwarf-locstack/"&gt;web playground&lt;/a&gt; to run and share examples easily (see DWARF Issue &lt;a href="https://dwarfstd.org/issues/251120.1.html"&gt;251120.1&lt;/a&gt; for several such examples).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Concurrency in pid 1 and systemd in general is a touchy subject. systemd is very trigger happy when it comes to forking and when combined with multithreading this causes all sorts of issues, so there's an unwritten policy to not use threads in systemd. This has lead to (in my opinion) a sprawling callback hell in every daemon and CLI in the project that performs concurrent operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll present my view on the issues with using threads in systemd and why cooperative multitasking implemented using green threads can fix many of them while avoiding callback hell. I'll also briefly go over the unique problems you run into when designing a fiber based system in  and the general design for fibers in systemd, finishing with how they're implemented under the hood with ucontext.h.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to get feedback on the approach from the devroom, and bring awareness on how systemd is using the GNU toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenMP is a widely used framework for parallelizing applications, enabling thread-level parallelism via simple source-code annotations. It follows the fork-join model and relies heavily on barrier synchronization among worker threads. Running OpenMP- enabled applications in the cloud is increasingly popular due to elasticity, fast startup, and pay-as-you-go pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cloud-based execution, worker threads run inside a virtual machine (VM) and are subject to dual levels of scheduling: threads are placed on guest virtual CPUs (vCPUs), and vCPUs run as ordinary tasks on the host’s physical CPUs (pCPUs). The guest scheduler places threads on vCPUs, while the host scheduler places vCPUs on pCPUs. Because these schedulers act independently, a semantic gap emerges that can undermine application performance. Barrier synchronization, whose efficiency depends on timely scheduling decisions, is vulnerable to this semantic gap, and remains under-explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents my PhD thesis project supervised by Julia LAWALL and Jean-Pierre Lozi at Inria Paris. The thesis defines Phantom vCPUs to describe problematic host-level preemptions in which guest vCPUs remain queued on busy pCPUs, stalling progress. We show that OpenMP performance can be substantially improved inside oversubscribed cloud VMs by (1) dynamically adapting the degree of parallelism (DoP) at the start of each parallel region and (2) dynamically choosing between spinning versus blocking at barriers on a per-thread, per-barrier basis. We propose paravirtualized, scheduler-informed techniques that accurately guide these decisions and demonstrate their effectiveness in realistic deployments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first contribution of this thesis is Phantom Tracker,  an algorithmic solution implemented in the Linux kernel that leverages paravirtualized task scheduling to detect and quantify Phantom vCPUs accurately. the second contribution is pv-barrier-sync, a dynamic barrier synchronization mechanism driven by the scheduler insights produced by Phantom Tracker. The third and final contribution of is Juunansei, an OpenMP runtime extension that demonstrates the practical utility of Phantom Tracker and pv-barrier-sync with additional optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk discusses the context and motivation of this work, followed by a brief introduction of the Phantom Tracker, and then takes a deep dive into the libgomp implementation of  pv-barrier-sync and Juunansei.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As the only toolchain supporting the Sega Dreamcast's SH4 CPU, GCC remains the lifeblood of a thriving homebrew community for the platform. This talk focuses on the journey to democratize the upper echelons of the SH4's FPU performance for the community at-large, by taking a look at SH4ZAM, a hardware accelerated matrix and linear algebra library which has been developed to drive the performance needs of modern homebrew and ports within the community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A critical challenge in C as a general-purpose language is the absence of the notion of secret data in its abstract machine. This results in information disclosure be poorly detected by compilers that lack the required semantics to model any vulnerability related to secrets leakage. Numerous dedicated tools have exists to overcome this limitation; each of which comes with its own annotation rules, tainting model, and more importantly, its own narrow scope for a specific disclosure vulnerability. Such discrepancy has created confusion for the concerned developers that are mostly unwilling to support multiple external tools, especially when they address one problem at a time. In this talk, we introduce the required C constructions to bring secrets to the GCC compiler through its system of attributes. The resulted framework, that we call GnuSecret, does not only define consistent notations and semantics to designate secrets directly in the Gnu-C language, but also propagates them throughout the program code by leveraging the symbolic execution engine embedded into the GCC Static Analyzer (GSA). Of particular interest, GnuSecret is not bound to a specific vulnerability, as its modular design allows it to virtually model any vulnerability related to the MITRE's CWE-200 and its children.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Experimenting with the AArch64 Pointer Authentication (PAuth) ABI on bare-metal.</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LLVM has recently gained support for an ELF implementation of the AArch64 Pointer Authentication ABI (PAuthABI) for a Linux Musl target. This talk will cover: 
* An introduction to the PAuthABI and its LLVM support. 
* How to experiment with it on any Linux machine using qemu-aarch64 emulation.
* How to adapt the Linux Musl target to a bare-metal target using LLVM libc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AArch64 Pointer Authentication Code instructions are currently deployed on Linux to protect the return address on hardware that has support for it. This limited use case can be deployed in an ABI neutral way and run on existing hardware. The PAuthABI, based on Apple's Arm64E, takes the hardware and software backwards compatibility gloves off, and makes use of pointer authentication for code pointers such as function pointers and vtables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge to adapt the PAuthABI support for bare-metal is initialization of global pointers as on Linux this is done by the dynamic loader. We will need to build our own signer that operates before main.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ever been debugging a production issue and wished you'd added just one more log statement? Now you have to rebuild, wait for CI, deploy... all that time wasted. We've all been there, cursing our past selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've integrated LLVM's XRay into ClickHouse to solve this. It lets us hot-patch running production systems to inject logging, profiling, and even deliberate delays into any function. No rebuild required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XRay reserves space at function entry/exit that can be atomically patched with custom handlers at runtime. We built three handler types: LOG to add the trace points you forgot, SLEEP to reproduce (or prevent) timing-sensitive bugs, and PROFILE for deterministic profiling to complement our existing sampling profiler. The performance overhead when inactive is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is simple. Send a SQL query as &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM INSTRUMENT ADD LOG `QueryMetricLog::startQuery` 'This message will be logged at the start of the function"'&lt;/code&gt; to patch the function instantly. Results show up in &lt;code&gt;system.trace_log&lt;/code&gt;. Remove it just as easily when you're done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll cover the integration challenges (ELF parsing, thread-safety, atomic patching), performance numbers (4-7% binary size, near-zero runtime cost), and real production war stories.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, the LLVM community has been building a general-purpose GPU offloading library. While still in its early stages, this library aims to provide a unified interface for launching kernels across different GPU vendors. The long-term vision is to enable diverse projects—ranging from OpenMP® to SYCL™ and beyond—to leverage a common GPU offloading infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing this new library alongside the existing OpenMP® offloading infrastructure has introduced several interesting challenges, as both share the same plugin system. This is particularly evident in the implementation of the OpenMP® Tools Interface (OMPT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll explore the journey so far:
•   Project history – how the effort started and evolved.
•   Current architecture – the organization of the offloading library today.
•   API design – what the interface looks like and how it works.
•   Plugins – the lower-level components that make vendor-specific integration possible.
•   Challenges – issues encountered in the current OMPT implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>OrcJIT at Scale with the llvm-autojit Plugin</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LLVM’s ORC JIT [1] is a powerful framework for just-in-time compilation of LLVM IR. However, when applied to large codebases, ORC often exhibits a surprisingly high front-load ratio: we have to parse all IR modules before execution even reaches main(). This diminishes the benefits of JITing and contributes to phenomena as the “time to first plot” latency in Julia, one of ORC’s large-scale users [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The llvm-autojit plugin [3] is a new experimental compiler extension for automatic just-in-time compilation with ORC.  The project reached a proof-of-concept state, where basic C, C++ and Rust programs build and run successfully. It integrates easily with build systems like CMake, make and cargo, making it practical to apply to real-world projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will examine the front-loading issue in ORC and explain how llvm-autojit mitigates it. Attendees will learn about pass plugins, LLVM IR code transformations, callgraphs and runtime libraries. And they will see how to experiment with ORC-based JITing in their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Generating Programmable NPUs from Linalg with MLIR and CIRCT</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Every new AI workload seems to need new hardware. Companies spend months designing NPUs (neural processing units), then more months building compilers for them—only to discover the hardware doesn't efficiently run their target workloads. By the time they iterate, the algorithm has moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a work-in-progress approach that generates NPU hardware directly from algorithm specifications using MLIR and CIRCT. Starting from a computation expressed in MLIR's Linalg dialect, our toolchain automatically generates synthesizable SystemVerilog for custom NPU architectures and hooks it up automatically to a RISC-V control host with an optimized memory hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "algorithm-first" hardware generation inverts the traditional flow: instead of designing hardware then hoping the compiler can use it effectively, we generate hardware that is provably optimal for specific Linalg operations. The approach enables rapid exploration of the hardware/algorithm co-design space: change the algorithm, regenerate the hardware, and immediately see the impact on area, power, and performance.
In this talk, we'll demonstrate:
* Live generation of NPU RTL from Linalg operations
* The MLIR dialect stack that bridges high-level algorithms to CIRCT hardware representations
* Performance comparisons between generated hardware and handmade open-source NPUs
* Open questions around generalization vs. specialization trade-offs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work aims to make hardware generation accessible to compiler engineers and algorithm researchers, not just hardware designers. We'll discuss both the potential and limitations of this approach, and where the research needs to go next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target audience: Compiler engineers, hardware architects, ML systems researchers. Basic familiarity with MLIR helpful but not required.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly support in Swift started as a community project and became an official part of Swift 6.2. As Swift on WebAssembly matures, developers need robust debugging tools to match. This talk presents our work adding native debugging support for Swift targeting Wasm in LLDB. WebAssembly has some unique characteristics, such as its segmented memory address space, and we'll explore how we made that work with LLDB's architecture. Additionally, we'll cover how extensions to the GDB remote protocol enable debugging across various Wasm runtimes, including the WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR), JavaScriptCore (JSC), and WasmKit.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;llvm-mingw is a mingw toolchain (freely redistributable toolchain targeting Windows), built entirely with LLVM components instead of their GNU counterparts, intended to work as a drop-in replacement for existing GNU based mingw toolchains. Initially, the project mainly aimed at targeting Windows on ARM, but the toolchain supports all of i686, x86_64, armv7 and aarch64, and has been getting use also for projects that don't target ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I describe how the project got started, and how I made a working toolchain for Windows on ARM64 before that even existed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;C++ remains central to high-performance and scientific computing, yet interactive workflows for the language have historically been fragmented or unavailable. Developers rely on REPL-driven exploration, rapid iteration, rich visualisation, and debugging, but C++ lacked incremental execution, notebook integration, browser-based execution, and JIT debugging. With the introduction of &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangRepl.html"&gt;clang-repl&lt;/a&gt;, LLVM now provides an upstream incremental compilation engine built on Clang, the IncrementalParser, and the ORC JIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents how the Project Jupyter, Clang/clang-repl, and Emscripten communities collaborated to build a complete, upstream-aligned interactive C++ environment. &lt;a href="https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp"&gt;Xeus-Cpp&lt;/a&gt; embeds clang-repl as a native C/C++ Jupyter kernel across Linux, macOS, and Windows, enabling widgets, plots, inline documentation, and even CUDA/OpenMP use cases. &lt;a href="https://compiler-research.org/xeus-cpp-wasm/lab/index.html"&gt;Xeus-Cpp-Lite&lt;/a&gt; extends this model to the browser via WebAssembly and JupyterLite, compiling LLVM and Clang to WASM and using wasm-ld to dynamically link shared wasm modules generated per cell at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete the workflow, Xeus-Cpp integrates LLDB-DAP through clang-repl’s out-of-process execution model, enabling breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection, and full debugging of JIT-generated code directly in JupyterLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will detail how clang-repl, ORC JIT, wasm-ld, LLDB, and LLDB-DAP come together to deliver a modern, sustainable interactive C++ workflow on both desktop and browser platforms, with live demonstrations of native and WebAssembly execution along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLVM Components Involved :&lt;/strong&gt; clang, clang-repl, orc jit, wasm-ld, lldb, lldb-dap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Audience :&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers, Educators, Students, C/C++ Practitioners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note :&lt;/strong&gt; Please make sure to check out the demos/links added to the Resource section. These demos would be shown live in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This year, systemd had a breakup with its bad practice of including unused headers all over the codebase. This resulted in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 33% speedup in from scratch build times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 50% reduction in runtime for our build test CI jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thousands of lines of code removed from the codebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll present how I went about this work, using clang-include-cleaner, clang-tidy and ClangBuildAnalyzer, and including the challenges I faced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A scalable way to organize source to minimize unused headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different build configurations which change the used headers in a source file due to #ifdef conditionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing features in clang-tidy and clang-include-cleaner (and my contributions to LLVM to implement those)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Zero-sysroot hermetic LLVM cross-compilation using Bazel</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cross-compiling C and C++ is still a tedious process. It usually involves carefully crafted sysroots, Docker images and specific CI machine setups. The process becomes even more complex when supporting multiple libcs and libc versions, or architectures whose sysroots are hard or impossible to generate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present toolchains_llvm_bootstrapped, an open-source Bazel module that replaces sysroots with a fully hermetic, self-bootstrapping C/C++ cross-compilation toolchain based on LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dive into how the project wires together three Bazel toolchains:
* A raw LLVM toolchain based on prebuilt LLVM binaries that cross-compiles all target runtimes from source: CRT objects, libc (glibc or musl), libstdc++/libc++, libunwind, compiler-rt, etc.
* A runtime-enabled toolchain that uses those freshly built runtimes to hermetically compile your application code.
* An optional self-hosted toolchain used to build LLVM entirely from source (pre-release, patched, or local branches), which is then used for the two previous stages; all in a single Bazel invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also showcase unique use cases enabled by this approach:
* Cross-compiling to any target, entirely from source, with little to no configuration.
* Whole-program sanitizer setups that are almost impossible with prebuilt sysroots.
* Targeting arbitrary versions of the glibc.
* Setup-free remote execution for cross compilation tasks.
* Applying patches to LLVM, building a new toolchain and testing it against real-world projects, without manual bootstrapping steps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free as in Burned Out: Who Really Pays for Open Source?</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open Source powers nearly everything in our digital lives, from web servers to smartphones. In many ways, we could say Open Source has "won". But can we really celebrate that victory when so many maintainers are burning out, while users and companies continue to depend on their unpaid labor?
The current sustainability models, from corporate sponsorships to paid support, often fall short, leaving creators overwhelmed and users with unrealistic expectations.
In this talk, we’ll take a critical look at how Open Source has been funded (or not funded), why many existing models are failing, and what new paths we might explore to ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem.
We’ll dissect funding approaches like donations, sponsorships, and open core, and ask some uncomfortable questions: Why are we still relying on volunteers to power global infrastructure? Is it time for an Open Source tax? Would paying volunteers actually motivate or demotivate them?
This is not just a talk about money. It’s a call to radically rethink what sustainability really means for Open Source, and how we can build a future that doesn’t run on burnout.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Strategy for Trusting your Employer in Open Source: a Historical Approach</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In today's world everyone just gets open source ... at least you don't
have to explain what it is any more.  However, the way a corporation
runs is based on transaction needs rather than deep philosophical
beliefs, so Open Source and your place within a corporation (and often
your value to it) depend on your ability to translate between these
two positions.  This talk aims to equip modern open source developers
with the ability to navigate this translation effectively.  And,
although the transaction nature means trust is fleeting, constantly
adjusting to the transactional needs can build fleeting trust into a
longer term reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Linux isn't the first open source project, it is the first
one to begin successfully co-opting corporations into its development
model. In the beginning Linux was a wholly volunteer operation that
leaked into corporate data centres via subversive means.  When the
leak became a flood those in charge of the data centres reluctantly
blessed Linux deployment to avoid being swept away.  This meant that
all the ancillary producers (drivers for hardware, databases,
industrial applications etc.) all had to come to Linux on its own
terms (which we, the Linux community hadn't actually thought about at
the time).  It also meant that relationships that began completely
antagonistically usually ended up being harmonious (yesterday's enemy
almost always became today's friend). The result was a years long
somewhat collaborative project to develop rules of engagement between
open source projects and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover three things that came out of these rules of
engagement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;agency: a corporation deals with open source through its developers
at the code face.  They are empowered to make decisions on its behalf
way beyond any proprietary developer ever was and this empowerment
changes the internal as well as external dynamics of employer to
employee interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual Development: As an open source contributor you become
responsible for deciding what's best for the project (and persuading
your employer to agree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic misalignment: although corporations understand that they
have to do open source, internally there's often an uneven penetration
of how to do it.  Thus a significant part of a good open source
employees time is spent doing internal alignment to make sure internal
lack of comprehension doesn't get it the way of sound execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll give examples of how to leverage these rules, an understanding
of which will allow you to build a shifting transactional trust
between you want your employer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;“Who pays your bills?” was the first question my now-CTO asked me,when we didn’t even know each other. Years later, we co-founded OPENGIS.ch, a 40-person company that thrives on geospatial open-source software and gives back by contributing heavily to the projects we build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share our journey building QField, an open-source mobile app with more than 2 million downloads, and creating a sustainable business model around it and QGIS. I’ll explain how the QGIS.org community works, and show why open source is not just a philosophy, but a real business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll explore sustainability, community, and business, the three pillars that allow open-source software to flourish and its contributors to make a living from it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Who Funds the Egg? Cracking the FOSS Funding Paradox</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Every successful open source project starts small, but not every small project gets the chance to succeed. Here’s the paradox: funders prefer to back proven impact, yet impact requires early support. If new initiatives can’t access resources until they already “look successful,” we risk starving the very ecosystem that keeps open source innovative and diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores this chicken-and-egg dilemma and proposes ways to flip the script. What would it look like if we invested not only in impact already proven, but also in potential?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my experience building &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pre-seeds-research-101/"&gt;Pre-Seeds: Research 101&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll share insights into the struggles early-stage projects face (e.g., limited visibility, lack of credibility, and difficulty accessing networks). I'll also highlight the kinds of support that make a difference, sharing lessons on how these projects can be supported beyond grants. From spotlighting them on community stages and amplifying their voice online, to connecting them with mentors and fellowships — these “non-monetary investments” can bridge the gap until traditional funding becomes viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with concrete ideas for how they — as individuals, organisations, or communities — can sustain the pipeline of emerging projects, ensuring the long-term resilience of open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want an open, thriving, and continuously renewing FOSS ecosystem, we need to get better at nurturing the eggs, not just celebrating the chickens.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Building the next generation of open source contributors – Lessons from 30 years of Postgres</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How do we find and nurture the next generation of open source contributors? Unlike commercial companies, open source projects don’t have legions of recruiters to bring people into the fold—and yet our projects need a steady stream of new contributors. Or should open source projects assume that new contributors (and future committers) will continue to “self-select” onto the project? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;PostgreSQL open source project&lt;/a&gt; turns 30 in 2026 (Happy Birthday!). It has evolved from a small project that some referred to as “just a toy”—to today, where Postgres is thriving with an active community and a vast ecosystem of extensions and tooling. The project has clearly done some things right. Postgres is hugely popular, with a healthy upstream open source community plus a host of companies and products built around Postgres itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Postgres is owned by no one company; instead, a multitude of competing interests align as people from different countries and continents roll up their sleeves to get the work done. But what happens when the current generation of Postgres committers step back or retire—where will the next generation of Postgres contributors come from? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres isn’t special in needing new contributors. It just happens to be a 30-year-old project whose successes, experiments, and failures might apply to other communities too. In this talk, we’ll look at how contributors find their way into Postgres: what worked, what didn’t, and where we’re still struggling. And having the conversation at FOSDEM will help us think together about a challenge common to all of us—how successful open source projects need to evolve as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Introduction – Why FOSS compliance matters today: legal exposure, rising regulatory demands under the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and growing supply chain accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal Framework – Overview of license obligations, liability risks, and the intersection of open source compliance with regulatory requirements (CRA, AI Act, product safety law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-Based Approach – How organizations can tailor the depth and scope of compliance to project risk, software use, and supply chain complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice and Tools – SBOMs, scanning tools, policy frameworks, and OpenChain implementation: what actually works to make compliance efficient and auditable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRA Integration – How FOSS compliance measures support CRA obligations, especially regarding documentation, security updates, and traceability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion and Outlook – From obligation to opportunity: compliance as a mark of quality and a driver of market trust.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2024 we gave a talk called "The Regulators are Coming". This year, the regulators are here! This would be a talk to update the broader community on how the implementation of the CRA is advancing, and how we have made efforts to include the open source community so far. The concept would involve a short update from EC, the european standardisation organisations and representatives of the open source community who have been participating in the standardisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Geopolitics of Code: From Digital Sovereignty to Global Fragmentation</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="main">Main Track</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source represents 70% to 90% of modern software codebases and this is today seen as as a crucial global public infrastructure by many players. Given its ubiquity, this is increasingly part of geopolitical discussions and national-security agendas. This presentation will analyze the risks and governance challenges at the intersection of open source and global politics, with a focus on the recent European discourse on digital sovereignty and supply-chain security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core dilemma is that open source's power lies in the mutualization of risk (collective maintenance and faster vulnerability detection), but this is being undermined by fragmentation along national and corporate lines. We will explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weaponization of Open Source: How jurisdictional control over key platforms (like GitHub and PyPI, largely hosted by US entities) translates into geopolitical tools (the "Panopticon" and "Chokepoint" effects), as seen in the 2019 GitHub sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of Investment: The crisis of critical components being maintained by small, under-resourced teams, creating an ecosystem that powers the global economy but lacks the resources to secure itself (e.g., the Log4j incident, XZ, and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fragmentation Trend: The response from nations like China, which are building domestic repositories (Gitee, OpenAtom Foundation) as part of a plan for technological self-sufficiency. This fragmentation reduces interoperability and shared visibility. This makes open source more weak and less resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will conclude by openly discussing a shared call to action for the FOSS community: How can we forge a stronger shared responsibility between developers, policymakers, and industry to mitigate these losses and keep open source secure, interoperable, and globally accessible?.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Hacker Folk Art of Esoteric Code</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="main">Main Track</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past twenty years, I've written about esolangs as a hacker folk art for the blog esoteric.codes, bringing the voice of many esolangers together, to find crossover in their approach to computation as a medium. Meanwhile, I've produced esolangs of my own, recently brought together by MIT Press in Forty-Four Esolangs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk brings together both projects, to show the potential of this hacker folk art to go far beyond the listicles of puzzle languages and joke languages with which it is often associated. Its languages ask programmers to write code as a series of photographs, or by two programmers typing in tandem, or using global variables that are global across the world. It presents esolangs as challenges to conventional ideas about code: everything from "the cognitive gap between the text and performance  of code should be as small possible" to "languages should lead to runnable programs" or even "code should be written with intent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk emphasizes esolangs as a community form built on dialogue between esolangers and the esoprogrammers who explore their ideas and find the limits of their languages. I hope to inspire more programmers to recognize esolangs as our own space of play and embrace it as an experimental medium. In this moment, when AI tools help reinforce a particular, corporatized vision of how code should look, esolangs offer resistance to this monostyle and against the de-skilling of programming as art.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The regular FOSDEM lightning talk track isn't chaotic enough, so this year we're doubling down on Lightning Lightning Talks (now with added lightning!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought of a last minute topic you want to share? Got your interesting talk rejected? Has something exciting happened in the last few weeks you want to talk about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get that talk submitted to Lightning Lightning Talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submitted talks will be automatically presented by our Lightning Lightning Talk System, which keeps track of the time limit for the current speaker and the order of presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenters who attempt to speak for longer than 256 seconds risk being swept off the stage by our Lightning Lightning Talk Cleanup Crew.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The curl project has been bombarded by large volumes of low quality AI slop security reports and Daniel shows examples. Sloppy humans causing Denial-of-Service attacks by overloading maintainers with quickly produced almost-real-looking rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, upcoming new AI powered tools find flaws and mistakes in existing code in ways no previous code analyzers have been able to. Daniel names names and shows examples of findings, some that even feels almost human. Next level bug-hunting for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI now simultaneously brings us the worst and the best.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Know Your Enemies: Live Exploit of a PHP Engine Security Breach</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;All programming languages have their foundations: the engine that interprets your code and makes everything run. In PHP, this is the Zend Engine, a critical piece of software that powers millions of applications worldwide. When everything works, you don’t even think about it. You deploy to production, and the engine does its magic behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when something goes wrong in that core? What if a subtle bug opens the door to a full security breach? Suddenly, the invisible foundation becomes the most important part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s shine a light on two such cases: a recent, real vulnerability in the PHP engine (which has since been patched), and a backdoor that, just a few years ago, actually made it into the release candidate and allowed remote code execution. We’ll walk through how each issue could be exploited and, most importantly, what lessons developers can draw from them. And yes, there will be live, local, sandboxed demos of both exploits in action. Ready to dive in?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Hidden Life of Infrastructure: How Control Moves Through Code, Chips, and Nations</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how risk and control moves through the computational stack, from transistors to firmware, from chip monopolies to satellite networks, from invisible maintainers to AI accelerators. We'll walk through the failures that mattered: Heartbleed. Log4Shell. Spectre. The Garmin ransomware attack. The XZ backdoor. Not because they broke things, but because they showed us where power actually lives, and how fragile those concentrations really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of those failures revealed something: how physical constraints shape digital power, how a single unpaid maintainer can hold up half the internet, how optimization culture erodes resilience. They showed us that nations, economies, and individual freedom now depend on infrastructure most people will never see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the thing: Open Source built that infrastructure. And Open Source can reshape it.
This is about understanding where we are, how we got here, and what it means to build systems that distribute power instead of concentrating it. Because the people who write the code should be the ones who decide how it works, and who it works for.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Spotify is the world's largest music streaming service, yet it has never fullfilled the flexibility and platform support needs of the ones enjoying home automation, open streamers and more. For over a decade, the librespot family of projects has been filling that void through reverse engineering of Spotify's products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk takes you through one of the longest-running efforts to open up the Spotify ecosystem. We'll explore the technical approaches used to reverse engineer the official clients, the evolution of the project as Spotify's architecture changed, and the delicate balance of operating in legal grey areas while keeping the open source project alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this brought to you by the maintainer of &lt;a href="https://github.com/devgianlu/go-librespot"&gt;go-librespot&lt;/a&gt; and memeber of &lt;a href="https://github.com/librespot-org"&gt;librespot-org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Fear and Loathing in the App Stores: when FLOSS principles collide with the Gatekeeper interests</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="main">Main Track</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The promise of smartphones was freedom in your pocket. The reality? Two corporate gatekeepers controlling what software billions of users can run on devices they supposedly own. This talk examines the uncomfortable compromises FLOSS developers face when trying to distribute apps through iOS and Android app stores, where every principle we hold dear—user freedom, privacy, transparency, and community control—runs headlong into the profit-driven interests of the global mobile duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore the battleground where free software principles meet platform restrictions: mandatory code signing that undermines reproducible builds, opaque review processes that can arbitrarily reject apps exercising user freedom, 30% revenue cuts that punish sustainable FLOSS funding models, and Terms of Service that can revoke your ability to distribute software overnight. The Digital Markets Act promised to open these walled gardens, but has it? Or have we merely traded one gatekeeper's rules for slightly different ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about technical hurdles—it's about fundamental questions. Should FLOSS projects compromise on GPL compliance to reach users? Is it ethical to pay fees and developer taxes when that money funds the very infrastructure restricting user freedom? When F-Droid and alternative app stores offer true freedom but reach only 2% of users, do we accept the compromise or maintain ideological purity while our potential impact dwindles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes are existential. As our digital lives increasingly occur on locked-down mobile devices, FLOSS becomes the last line of defense against surveillance capitalism, planned obsolescence, and the erosion of user agency. If we can't effectively distribute free software on the platforms where users actually are, we risk relegating FLOSS to irrelevance precisely when it's needed most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's hope. New regulatory frameworks, emerging alternative stores, advances in progressive web apps, and creative technical solutions offer paths forward. We'll discuss practical strategies for maximizing reach while minimizing compromise, building communities that value freedom over convenience, and preparing for a post-duopoly future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will challenge both the compromisers and the purists, asking uncomfortable questions: Are we collaborating with platforms that fundamentally oppose our values? Or are we pragmatically meeting users where they are? The answer may determine whether free software thrives or withers in the mobile era.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Free and Open Source ecosystem has continued to evolve and adapt itself despite an ever-changing landscape that, paradoxically, seems to find pleasure in threatening its very own fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet our resilience won't be able to sustain another direct hit, this time coming from the fact that Open Source lives at odds with the UX/UI Design Process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source, both as a social contract and as a practice, cannot afford not to fully own the strategic space that dictates how we connect with end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain why this has become so crucial and why, while open-source developers are the most likely audience to suffer the most if this is not dealt with, they are also the most naturally equipped to lead a new design&amp;amp;code worldwide alliance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freesewing.eu/"&gt;FreeSewing&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/freesewing/freesewing"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; project that provides a core (Javascript) library for designing parametric sewing patterns, as well as a growing collection of designs and supporting tools. We've been around for more than a decade, and in that time have built a large user base among the maker community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeSewing designs are implemented as code giving you unmatched power and flexibility.
You can mix and match parts from different designs, extend them, or add options that turn one base design into many. Our choice for Javascript means you can run all of this in your browser. Suffice to say, these are not your grandma's sewing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover why I started FreeSewing, the pain points it aims to address, and how it works under the hood. I'll also cover our tech stack, and the choices we've made in this area, as well as how we needed to adapt as we outgrew our earlier choices. In addition, I'll cover some of the lessons learned after more than a decade of designing parametric sewing patterns for bodies in all shapes and forms. I will also include tips for running an open source project for a prolonged period of time while avoiding the pitfalls of maintainer burn-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll bring some cool swag too.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Automating translation of a bestseller to spark children's interest in coding</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The story “Ada &amp;amp; Zangemann – A Tale of Software, Skateboards and Raspberry Ice Cream” inspires the software freedom community because it covers more than the simple value of learning to program. It also covers the importance of control over technology and its impact on society. In this way the story is inspiring many kids, teens, parents and many others to learn programming and shape technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too was captivated by the story. Working on a Dutch translation sent me down the path of improving the automation to help others like me to translate the story and publish it in different formats. The free culture license of the book enables and compels the community to adapt it, and they have. The community keeps surprising us with new formats to convey the story. Since its release it has been translated into 30 languages, published as a book in 7 and as movie in 5. And it is available in a growing number of other formats: epub, online book, bilingual book and kamishibai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation and localization is the primary purpose of the automation. More interesting and ambition is to support the increasing number of formats: from printed book, to online book, voiceover text and subtitles. This wide variety of formats presents a unique challenge for which no ready-made solution exists. By leveraging open standards (XML, Docbook, ITS) and Free Software (Scribus, itstool, gettext, xsltproc, pandoc, Weblate) we created automation that enables translators to add new languages while also enabling new formats to be added.  This includes a novel method for inserting text and images into Scribus. This multi-media setup can be used as inspiration for other free culture multi-media projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will tell the story how the automation developed over time. We'll share the inspiring stories from the community that leveraged the automation and influenced its development. The technical challenge of the automation is fun, but the community stories give it meaning and motivate me to keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this presentation we hope to inspire others to contribute to the Ada &amp;amp; Zangemann community by translating, adding a new format or contributing to the automation and to share own materials benefiting our community as Open Educational Resources.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we envision an ecosystem of open mapping technology that enables everyone, and in particular vulnerable communities, to make open map data available in order to use in disaster response and humanitarian context. We focus on building with our community and involving our users in every step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we would like to take you on a journey in introducing the full end-to-end open mapping workflow and the open source tools enabling that process - from the newly developed Drone Tasking Manager to fAIr (our AI assisted mapping service), Field Tasking Manager, ChatMap and uMap. We will share some stories from case studies in testing the end to end mapping workflow in Indonesia and Sierra Leone and the lessons learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that you will leave this talk inspired and with an understanding on how YOU can become part of the open mapping ecosystem and contribute to the technology development!&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Btrfs was merged into the Linux kernel in 2009, arriving with bold promises—and, let's be honest, a reputation for instability. I first tried it on my laptop in 2011. It wiped my data. Twice. On the bright side, it taught me the value of backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025: btrfs is no longer the experimental filesystem of the past. It's stable, mature, feature-rich, and fully part of the Linux kernel. But old reputations die hard. Even today, Google Cloud Platform doesn’t officially support it—not because of technical shortcomings, but because customer demand hasn’t pushed the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Chronosphere, we decided to take a fresh look. After months of evaluation and testing, we migrated petabytes of customer data across thousands of disks to btrfs. This talk is our story: why we made the leap, what we learned along the way, and how we’re helping bring btrfs into wider enterprise adoption—including working with Google to support it natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share the decision-making process, key performance and reliability insights, and the quirks you only discover when running btrfs at scale. Whether you're btrfs-curious or just love a good ops tale, you'll walk away with real-world takeaways—and maybe a newfound respect for this once-maligned filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In an era where our identities and rights are increasingly mediated by devices we call “phones”, the boundaries between digital citizenship and corporate feudalism are blurring. This talk explores the intersection of technology, autonomy, and community within the unique context of transformational festivals, temporary autonomous zones (TAZs) (or future isolated neightborhoods and local communities?) where experimentation and reappropriation of tools take center stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from a cyberpunk reflection — &lt;em&gt;high tech, low life&lt;/em&gt; — the talk questions how much of that dystopian vision has already become reality: from algorithmic control to the loss of privacy and digital dependency. Drawing on the legacy of radio as an anarchic medium and the new rise of mesh networks such as &lt;strong&gt;Meshtastic/Meshcore/Reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Things Network&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Helium&lt;/strong&gt;, Davide Gomba connects past and future: from Marconi lighting up the Cristo Redentor in 1931 to today’s decentralized communication protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through examples from &lt;strong&gt;Lutopia’s “Ozorian Experiment” (2024)&lt;/strong&gt; and the ongoing &lt;strong&gt;Burning Mesh&lt;/strong&gt; initiative, the talk presents how off-grid communication can become both a poetic and political act - reclaiming connection, rebuilding resilience, and teaching new forms of digital literacy. Between &lt;strong&gt;cyberpunk dystopia and techno-anarchic optimism&lt;/strong&gt;, “The Meshiverse OR The Revolution of the Little Radios” is a manifesto for the right to communicate freely - even, and especially, when the network goes dark.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the "Local First, sync engines and CRDTs devroom", first edition this year at FOSDEM'26.
We are excited to propose you a full day of amazing talks ranging from CRDT libraries and frameworks, to local first projects using them, and including academic research, UX design, sync protocols and engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe Local First software is the future of app development. But what is Local First software?
In this short introduction we will touch upon the general concepts and describe this new paradigm that gathers an ever growing community of enthusiast engineers, designers, researchers and developers, following the motto: "You own your data, in spite of the cloud".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please come early to the devroom to take your seat, as we will start on time (9:00AM sharp). The room will be open as early as 8:30AM. It has limited capacity, and when reached, the door will be closed. We have an amazing lineup of great speakers, and you surely do not want to miss one bit of it. See you on Sunday morning!
Advice from the devroom managers: Don't miss the next talk: Jazz is a great framework and Anselm will start with an introduction to CRDTs for those who don't have prior knowledge. And then, second advice: stay with us all day, we have selected only amazing talks!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CRDTs are an exciting primitive for distributed state. In local-first apps, synced CRDTs can be framed as a natural extension to reactive local state, allowing developers to build eventually consistent multi-device and multi-user apps, with business logic living completely on the client, only requiring generic syncing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key feature that traditional backends solve remains a challenge, though: how do permissions work in this world? In addition to being a batteries-included framework that makes local-first state practical, Jazz uniquely solves local-first permissions, by coupling public-key cryptography with CRDTs in a way that allows for dynamic, expressive permission structures which can be defined on the client and are enforced globally, in an auditable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice from the devroom managers: Don't miss this talk! Jazz is great framework and Anselm will start with an introduction to CRDTs for those who don't know what it is. And then, second advice: stay with us all day, we have selected only amazing talks!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yjs is one of the oldest and most widely used libraries that enhance web editors by allowing multiple users collaborate over documents in real time, also without requiring continuous network connection. Evernote and Jupyter Notebooks are among many of its prominent users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this presentation we'll address some of the common pitfalls that new developers may encounter when working with Yjs library, what architectural foundations are causing them to happen and what can we do to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Local-First in Production: How We Built Plane's Collaborative Wiki with Yjs</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/makeplane/plane"&gt;Plane&lt;/a&gt; is an open source project management tool used by thousands of teams. A year ago, we shipped Wiki — a collaborative documentation system built on Yjs with real-time editing, offline support, and version history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yjs is remarkable. Kevin Jahns and the community have built something incredible — real-time sync, conflict resolution, offline editing, all handled elegantly. But integrating a powerful library is just the start. This talk is about what comes after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll cover the production challenges we solved building on top of Yjs, the crux of it would be around: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-side edits — making backend mutations (AI, automations, database state sync in case of subdocuments) coexist with live client editing without users feeling out of sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling the sync layer — infrastructure decisions for thousands of concurrent documents with awareness working as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large document performance — what breaks when documents get massive, and how we fixed it without breaking our servers, horizontally scaling sticky ws connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version history — snapshots and visual diffs using StateVectors and the StructStore (deep-dive: palanikannan.com/blogs/version-history-and-snapshots-in-yjs) and what works at scale! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline-first in practice — making "syncs when you're back" actually reliable, especially say when you open your tab that chrome killed due to inactivity :p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permissions and reacting to them in realtime, inline comments sync and so much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plane is &lt;a href="github.com/makeplane/plane"&gt;fully open source&lt;/a&gt; with 38k+ stars and a vibrant OSS community. Real problems, real code, no theory slides.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Automerge is a mature library for building local first applications by enabling version control for structured data. The strategy is to capture all edits to data at a very fine grain (e.g. per keystroke when editing text) and then present a good API for managing concurrently edited versions of this data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version control approach to collaboration makes working concurrently feasible and makes servers fungible - it increases user autonomy, but it introduces problems as you can't rely on access control on the network boundary. Keyhive is a local first access control architecture which we think is a compelling point in the design space which solves these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will give a high level overview of the motivation, design, problems, and future directions of the broader Automerge ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>NextGraph: E2EE sync engine, SDK, graph DB, and reactive ORM</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NextGraph is a protocol, a framework, and a platform that supports easy development of Local-First, decentralized, secure and private apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining the best of the local first world (Yjs, Automerge CRDT libraries), a graph database, DID (decentralized identifiers) for users and documents, and end-to-end encryption plus encryption at rest, we provide an SDK that offers all the requirements of portability, interoperability and security needed today for building a true alternative to Big Tech platforms and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be composed of two parts. Niko will first introduce the general architecture of our platform, engine, protocol and SDK, giving an overview of its components, and some details on the E2EE sync protocol, cryptographic capabilities/permissions/access control. We will show how we support any kind of CRDT, including Automerge and Yjs, and the CRDT for Graph database (RDF) that we have developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Laurin will introduce the new ORM TypeScript SDK for &lt;strong&gt;NextGraph&lt;/strong&gt; that turns document/database records into ordinary, typed objects with two‑way binding. By proxying those objects and emitting signals, the SDK provides a framework‑agnostic reactive layer that integrates cleanly with React, Vue, and Svelte. And more frameworks could be easily added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRDT support&lt;/strong&gt; - The SDK works with Yjs, Automerge, and, most notably, &lt;strong&gt;RDF&lt;/strong&gt; - a graph data format designed for application interoperability. The SDK includes a converter that transforms &lt;strong&gt;SHEX&lt;/strong&gt; shapes (an RDF schema language) into TypeScript type definitions for type safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactive POJOs&lt;/strong&gt; - Objects are wrapped in a proxy, so any property change triggers a signal, which updates both the UI and sends a JSON patch to the backend. Signals provide an efficient, event‑driven mechanism for state propagation and have been gaining popularity in modern front‑end ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will see&lt;/strong&gt; a live demo walking through a simple property change, showing how the mutation is instantly persisted to the local database, reflected in UI components across React, Vue, Svelte, and synchronized with the network across devices and user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building fast, resilient, and collaborative applications increasingly demands more than reactive UI frameworks and client-side state management. The next generation brings reactivity to the data layer itself—letting applications stay in sync with the backend automatically through a sync-engine architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores how &lt;a href="https://tanstack.com/db"&gt;TanStack DB&lt;/a&gt; provides a practical path toward such architectures without requiring a rewrite or commitment to a particular backend. You can start with familiar API-driven workflows using &lt;a href="https://tanstack.com/query"&gt;TanStack Query&lt;/a&gt; and progressively adopt richer sync through &lt;a href="https://electric-sql.com/"&gt;Electric&lt;/a&gt; or any real-time backend. TanStack DB acts as the connective tissue: a unified, fast, reactive client database that keeps application state synchronized with your backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of this presentation is TanStack DB’s newest capability: query-driven sync. Instead of preloading large collections or keeping oversized in-memory datasets, TanStack DB loads exactly the data a query needs—whether that’s a page of results, a slice of a document, or a relational join. Under the hood, an incremental view-maintenance engine built on differential dataflow ensures queries update efficiently as new data arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enables applications to handle larger data volumes, compute reactive queries efficiently, and move toward a true sync-engine architecture—without sacrificing the incremental adoption story that makes TanStack DB practical for real-world teams.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yjs is a widely used library to build collaborative applications. BlockNote and Prosemirror are text editors that closely integrate with Yjs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll preview upcoming functionality for Attributed Version History (who wrote what, and when?) and Track Changes (suggestions). We'll explore major new functionality coming in Yjs 14 (changesets and attributions), y-prosemirror and BlockNote that will make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BlockNote team (Nick, Yousef and Matthew) has collaborated closely with Yjs (Kevin Jahns) on these topics, funded by ZenDiS (OpenDesk) and DINUM (La Suite Docs).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Towards a Local-First Linux Desktop with Modal, Reflection and p2panda</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="local-first">Local-First, sync engines, CRDTs</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce our work within various collectives working together toward a more local-first future for modern Linux desktop and mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll introduce you to &lt;a href="https://modal.cx"&gt;Modal&lt;/a&gt;, a collective focused on bringing local-first principles to Linux Desktop and Mobile. We'll also showcase &lt;a href="https://github.com/p2panda/reflection"&gt;Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, our GTK-based text editor, and &lt;a href="https://p2panda.org/"&gt;p2panda&lt;/a&gt;, the underlying peer-to-peer stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modal is a new collective dedicated to development, design, organizing, policy campaigning, and more, to make computing more useful, secure, and resilient. Our work centeres around software infrastructure projects, including GNOME, postmarketOS, p2panda, systemd, and the Linux kernel. We aim to make it simple to sync data across your devices while providing easy-to-use local-first APIs for applications. By doing this, we're creating an ecosystem of free software apps that leverage this infrastructure for synchronization and real-time collaboration. The foundation of all this technology is the p2panda project, which is built with "walkaway" principles in mind. p2panda's modular networking stack allows applications to operate autonomously on a wide variety of infrastructures—whether it's the Internet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct / Aware, or even sneakernet - giving you flexibility and control over how and when your devices sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p2panda aims to provide everything you need to build modern, privacy-respecting and secure local-first applications. Over five years of research, testing, exploration and collaboration with other teams, we've identified emergent patterns which have been solidified in p2panda's "building blocks". We'll present an overview of the peer-to-peer problem space and describe how each of our modules are designed to provide Connectivity, Discovery, Sync, Encryption, Access Control, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll showcase concrete software built around Modal and p2panda, including Reflection, our native, GTK-based text editor. Reflection not only serves as a real-world example of a local-first application, but also as a "template" for developers looking to build similar apps. Alongside Reflection, we're developing a GObject interface for common p2p primitives, wrapped around p2panda and UI components. This interface aims to simplify the process of integrating decentralized networking into applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll discuss our work on a system service designed to enhance applications with p2p features, enabling a unified user experience at the OS level. This system service manages key tasks like permissions for networking activity, node trust management, multi-device support, and identity management through the address book. It is agnostic to any specific p2p framework, which we hope will foster greater interoperability across different platforms and p2p technologies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Teamtype: multiplayer mode for your text editor – towards a Collaborative Editing Protocol</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Files on your hard drive are the ultimate local-first storage. But to allow real-time collaboration from within text editors, developers currently have to reinvent the wheel each time: Figure out how to hook into buffer changes correctly, implement displaying remote cursors, finding a way to get the required events in and out of the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, for each combination of editor and collaborative use-case, there needs to be a separate plugin: For example, there is a Vim plugin to connect to an Etherpad, or you need individual editor plugins when wanting to live-code music or visuals together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar problems have already been solved by different editor-facing protocols: To integrate "language intelligence" tools (that provide autocompletion or refactorings), you can use the Language Server Protocol (LSP). Likewise, debugging support can be added via the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), and support for LLM tooling is now provided via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that there's a gap for a "Collaborative Editing Protocol" (CEP, working title) that allows text editors to talk to "collaboration servers", and thus provides them with collaboration functionality. Per editor, this protocol would only need to be implemented once, making the resulting software components interoperable. You'd have plugins for Neovim and for Emacs that speak CEP, and you'd have an Etherpad bridge that also speaks it, and you could use all of them together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we want to outline the requirements for a protocol like that. We'll discuss different approaches, and demonstrate the proof-of-concept protocol we built for our local-first peer-to-peer pair programming software "Teamtype". We're looking to form a group to iterate on a "collaboration protocol" together, and eventually standardize it!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Git came and changed the landscape of collaborating on code in a decentralised and efficient manner  – once you get to grips with the command-line, of course. GitHub capatilised on the fact that the social element of collaboration was missing from Git, while social platforms were emerging left, right, and centre. Our beloved, decentralised tool succumbed to the powers of decentralisation...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To empower Git users once more, the Radicle protocol (heartwood&lt;a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5"&gt;^1&lt;/a&gt;) has been building a decentralised forge to allow people to collaborate in a sovereign and local-first manner. It introduces the ability to define social artifacts that live alongside your code and are present right-there on your disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive in to see how we did this, and how you can get involved in shaping a better future for collaborating together. &lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://miru.media/"&gt;Miru&lt;/a&gt; is a set of web-based tools for media editing. In this talk, I'll present the video editing features that we're developing, and our journey to intuitive collaboration with offline support using CRDTs. I'll outline some similarities and differences between a video editing timeline and a rich text document, the CRDT libraries we evaluated, and what approaches did and didn't work for our editor.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nperez0111/teleportal"&gt;Teleportal&lt;/a&gt; is a framework for creating a web-standards based backend &amp;amp; client for realtime collaborative applications. It is based on the popular &lt;a href="https://yjs.dev/"&gt;Y.js CRDT&lt;/a&gt;, and implements a synchronization protocol on top. Teleportal focuses on giving the building blocks to create a server implementation, rather than being a single mono-lithic implementation. The project was built out of the desire for an optimized replacement of &lt;a href="https://tiptap.dev/docs/hocuspocus/"&gt;Hocuspocus&lt;/a&gt; (in both scale, performance &amp;amp; features). It currently implements communication over HTTP, HTTP + SSE, Websockets, but should scale to other bidirectional protocols. As well as being storage implementation agnostic &amp;amp; offering E2EE (alpha), there are plans to implement file uploads, user customizable messaging &amp;amp; more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CRDTs allow for decentralized replication of data. Capability security allows for decentralized control over behavior. Local-first applications often use access-control list (ACL) security which has significant downsides versus capabilities, especially in a decentralized context. In this talk, I'll examine how CRDTs and capabilities can be composed to improve the security of local-first applications using a group chat prototype as a case study.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CRDTs and local-first sync engines provide exciting opportunities for creating new experiences for our users, but with technological advances come new challenges, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the network connection is restored, how do we replace stale data without disorienting the user?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an app allows partial loading of remote data, how do we communicate what is and what is not available offline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If actions cannot be completed because of no or limited network connection, how can they know which actions haven’t been completed and retry them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a multiplayer app, how do we communicate in a non-disruptive way which content has changed and who has changed it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are questions that hadn’t needed to be addressed in a world of server-first apps, but we will need to take some thought in how to pair clear and informative UX with sync technologies to create the best possible user experiences for our apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go over pitfalls that we should avoid when making local-first apps and some patterns that can help make better experiences for our users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A lot of sync engines and CRDT tools has database-like API. It is very convenient for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to tell about different approach we used in Logux, where the core part of API is a log, not a state. It allows us to create a framework where you can build very different sync engines for different cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>SQLRooms: Local-First Analytics with DuckDB, Collaborative Canvas, and Loro CRDT Sync</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="local-first">Local-First, sync engines, CRDTs</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sqlrooms.org"&gt;SQLRooms&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) is an open-source React framework for building local-first data analytics applications powered by &lt;a href="https://duckdb.org"&gt;DuckDB&lt;/a&gt;. SQLRooms can run entirely in the browser using DuckDB-WASM, or connect to a shared session-backend running native DuckDB for larger datasets—in both cases, enabling privacy-preserving analytics where data stays under user control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll present SQLRooms' local-first architecture and our ongoing work on real-time collaboration using &lt;a href="https://loro.dev"&gt;Loro CRDT&lt;/a&gt;. We're building a Canvas module with SQL query cells and &lt;a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/"&gt;Vega-Lite&lt;/a&gt; visualization cells, a Notebooks module, and an underlying DAG (directed acyclic graph) engine that tracks dependencies between cells—automatically re-executing downstream cells when data changes. These modules will support collaborative editing via &lt;code&gt;@sqlrooms/crdt&lt;/code&gt;, with sync enabled through WebSockets using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/sqlrooms-duckdb-server/"&gt;sqlrooms-duckdb-server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key insight for analytics apps: DuckDB serves as a read-only query engine—the underlying data doesn't need to be synced. Only the UI state requires CRDT synchronization: queries, notebooks, canvas layouts, annotations, and comments. This CRDT state can be persisted both in a shared session-backend DuckDB and on local machines for offline access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For session-backend deployments, sqlrooms-duckdb-server provides a shared DuckDB instance where all connected clients query the same data—useful for large datasets or when consistent results matter. This can be deployed with e.g. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/"&gt;Cloudflare Containers&lt;/a&gt; for on-demand, per-session instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll discuss our choice of Loro over Yjs and how separating data (read-only DuckDB) from collaborative state (CRDT) simplifies the sync architecture while enabling privacy-preserving collaborative analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>A Programming Language Perspective on Replication</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="local-first">Local-First, sync engines, CRDTs</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Distributed systems replicate data to improve availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Ensuring that replicas remain eventually consistent is difficult. Current practices advocate for the use of Replicated Data Types (RDTs) which guarantee convergence out-of-the-box, e.g. CRDTs. However, programming distributed systems using these RDTs is non-trivial due to the lack of appropriate abstractions for replica discovery, update propagation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our research lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, we look at what it means for developers to build and utilise eventually consistent data types in their applications. The majority of current RDT approaches are ad-hoc, they require a dedicated implementation for each data type. However, building advanced collaborative applications requires custom RDTs that are tailored to the needs of the application. That implies extending or composing existing RDTs, or designing new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to develop abstractions and methodologies for the systematic construction of applications requiring replicated state. In this talk, we particularly focus on two main aspects: (1) non-ad hoc approaches to efficient RDT implementations, and (2) simplifying the development of application-specific RDTs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many approaches use ad-hoc solutions to track causality and ensure eventual convergence, e.g. keeping meta-data in the implementation. In a lot of cases, their design does not translate well into efficient implementations and is not suitable for resource-constrained runtimes. We present Flec[1, 2, 3], a framework that guides developers in making informed decisions during the development process, by providing an API that gives developers a uniform and structured way to deal with functional system requirements. This can range from network constraints to security and authorization aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the development of collaborative applications using RDTs, we investigate alternative approaches where RDTs can be automatically derived from their sequential implementation [4, 5]. By means of an analysis we can detect conflicting operations, and automatically derive functional CRDTs. In some datatypes, certain application invariants would be impossible to guarantee with CRDTs. For these cases, we support automatically detecting where an application would have to synchronise and output an RDT with mixed consistency.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://willowprotocol.org"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt; is a family of publicly-funded, open source peer-to-peer storage protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These protocols are designed to let you run your own independent digital spaces where you can share and collaborate on data with groups big and small. These digital spaces are stored on your own hardware, cutting out unwanted third parties. Only devices which have been given explicit consent to store data can receive it. Any kind of data can be stored, organised in a manner similar to files and folders. And data can travel between devices in many different ways, so you can choose the appropriate avenue, whether that's the internet or a USB key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will introduce our protocols: Willow, Meadowcap, Drop Format, and Confidential Sync, and what makes them different to other systems in the local-first ecosystem. We will also talk about our &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/worm-blossom/willow_rs"&gt;Rust implementations of these specifications&lt;/a&gt;, and how we are bringing torrent-like payload transfer to Willow using &lt;a href="https://worm-blossom.github.io/bab/"&gt;Bab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pouchdb.com"&gt;PouchDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://couchdb.apache.org"&gt;CouchDB&lt;/a&gt; have been an absolute Local-First Dream Team since 2013. In this workshop, we’ll show you why. Join us for hands-on time with PouchDB itself, a look at a fleshed out demo app to see how the Open Source projects PouchDB, CouchDB and app state fit together, and a quick glance at a convenient Open-Source way to easily host your own CouchDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local (in-client) data storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client-to-Server data synchronisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working offline and handling conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use database events to power your UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also share a bit about why we believe it is important to build on Open Source projects with a clear governance structure, so you can rely on it for the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time permitting, we’ll share some of the extraordinary projects we have built with PouchDB &amp;amp; CouchDB: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A COVID Vaccination infrastructure for all of Bavaria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting Ebola with first-responder support software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route planning for humanitarian relief efforts in an active crisis zone&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What if the web was designed for sovereign communities, instead of centralized platforms? &lt;a href="https://seed.hyper.media/"&gt;Seed Hypermedia&lt;/a&gt; brings first-class support for decentralized identity, provenance, and community governance, unlike the traditional web where these features are afterthoughts. Local-First principles and CRDTs are foundational to our protocol and software. The result isn’t just “offline-first documents,” it’s a model of a resilient and deeply-connected web that cannot be captured.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Two years have passed since we presented Domain crate, our DNS library written in Rust (https://github.com/NLnetLabs/domain) here at FOSDEM. We added a lot of functionality (for example, DNS client and server support, DNSSEC validation, DNSSEC signing) and started writing our first applications. The most notable application is our new DNSSEC signer called Cascade (https://github.com/NLnetLabs/cascade). In this presentation, I go over the work we have, what our plans are for the coming year. And we would like to hear from you, what would you like to see in a DNS library.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Given a large enough network of distributed nameservers, updating their configs and keeping all of them in sync becomes a highly error-prone activity. The problems multiply when multiple sysadmins and different operating systems are involved. We have created a low-complexity solution for syncing the NS configuration and keeping all servers aware of the current shape of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;On paper, DNS is a simple request-response protocol. In reality, building an authoritative nameserver that delivers under heavy load, processes malformed packets safely, and resists DDoS attacks is a complex engineering challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk peels back the layers of erldns, DNSimple's open-source high-performance DNS server, to explore the fundamental architecture required to handle millions of queries per second. We will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified Resolution: How a special binary tree structure drastically simplifies the DNS resolution logic, making complex requirements like empty non-terminals and handling zone cuts trivial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrency Models: How to structure a system that isolates failures per-request so that a crash in one query never brings down the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic Management: Strategies for handling UDP floods and managing TCP connection pools without exhausting resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packet Handling: The nitty-gritty of parsing binary DNS wire formats safely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the reference implementation uses Erlang, the architectural lessons on isolation, supervision, and fault tolerance are applicable to any language. This session is designed for developers and operators who want to understand the "nuts and bolts" of how robust DNS software is built.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Isn’t monitoring DNS queries a really bad idea? If the monitoring crosses the line to surveillance, we agree. Monitoring for bad actors is still needed and valuable for cybersecurity. Building such a platform in Open Source and running it as a non-profit is much better than letting commercial actors consume this data without making it an open data commons. For sure many won’t protect the user’s privacy the way we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story about the DNS TAPIR Open Source project - the reason we started it, our core principles and the architecture .&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As a developer, how do you add an automated check for software updates to your application? You could use DNS! DNS is lightweight, provides redundancy, responses are cacheable, and going through your network resolver gives you some privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, making DNS changes as part of a software release is not ideal, I've done it. Can we automate this? We can for Go applications! Gopherwatch.org is a free service that monitors the Go sumdb, a transparency log (like certificate transparency) containing all Go "modules" (libraries/applications) and their published versions. Gopherwatch.org provides a DNS interface for querying the latest version for all Go applications/libraries, and the latest Go toolchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll look at how the Gopherwatch DNS interface works and discuss limitations and possible future improvements. If there's time, we'll also look at how the DNS interface is used to provide one-click or even fully automated software updates for Go services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The DNS is a hoary protocol, with ancient secrets that man was not meant to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that learning too much about the dark corners of this ancient knowledge might drive one mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is your chance to learn mostly useless things about DNS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will cover quirks of the DNS protocol which are probably surprising, and hopefully interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: Due to constraints no entities from beyond time and space will be summoned during this talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The Opulent Voice Protocol (OVP) is an open-source digital voice protocol designed for bandwidth-constrained radio communications, including satellite and terrestrial amateur radio links. Developed through the peer-reviewed research and development process at Open Research Institute, OVP addresses the critical need for high-quality voice communication protocols that are freely implementable without licensing restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built around the 16 kbps Opus voice codec, OVP delivers superior voice quality that exceeds existing amateur digital voice modes while seamlessly integrating voice, keyboard chat, and data in a unified protocol. This eliminates the need for separate, clunky packet data modes. This talk will explore OVP's architecture, performance characteristics, and design trade-offs. The first implementation target for the modem is the PLUTO SDR and can be found here https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pluto_msk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Technical Features in the Reference Implementation:
Minimum shift keying modulation has constant envelope and no phase discontinuities. Optimized for low SNR conditions, with forward error correction and flywheel synchronization. Efficient bandwidth utilization suitable for 70 cm and above amateur bands. Current hardware implementation on FPGA enables a future open source ASIC design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover:
The architectural decisions behind OVP's design, showing how domain modeling of the radio channel shaped protocol choices. Audio quality comparisons between OVP and legacy digital voice modes. The integrated communication model, which allows voice, chat, and data to coexist in a single protocol. Performance analyses. Integration with existing SDR platforms and open-source radio stacks. Lessons learned from deploying OVP over the air. The peer-review process and how open collaboration improved the protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human-radio interface project is here: https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/interlocutor
Processor-side codebase (Xilinx/AMD 7010 Zynq) is here: https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/dialogus
Satellite simulator is here: https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/locus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is relevant to anyone interested in software-defined radio, open hardware communications systems, space technology, or building robust protocols for constrained environments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At a time when Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal spoofing and jamming has never been easier, time and frequency has become an ubiquitous commodity most distributed communication infrastructure rely on. Returning to the pre-space era of long range communication using very low frequency (VLF) signals, we investigate some of the remaining VLF time and frequency transfer signals. Despite their long communication range, the need for bulky antennas and low VLF noise environment makes the direct reception of these signals impractical. In this presentation, we collect timestamped records of VLF signals collected throughout the world from the KiwiSDR networl, and assess the performance of the broadcast signals and the receivers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WSDR is a web-based platform for real-time signal processing, application development, and custom workflow creation—all in a plug-and-play environment. Built on WebAssembly, WebUSB, and WebSockets, it supports even demanding workloads, including running a full open-source cellular network directly in the browser with all DSP executed on the frontend. In this session, we’ll show how WSDR simplifies building and deploying custom applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Parks-McClellan (Remez) algorithm is a filter design algorithm that is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the maximum error between the desired and realized transfer functions. Many implementations of this algorithm exist, including in GNU Radio and SciPy. However, some of these have issues such as numerical stability for some filter design problems. I will give a summary of the Remez algorithm, why there are different possible implementations, and why some may be better than others. I will also explain how to use this algorithm for some practical filter design problems. The talk is intended partly as publicity for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/maia-sdr/pm-remez/"&gt;pm-remez&lt;/a&gt; Python/Rust modern implementation by the speaker and partly as a tutorial on filter design.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, CERN uses White Rabbit to distribute the radio frequency
signal in the SPS accelerator and the LHC accelerator is planned to
also use White Rabbit for the next run (2030).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give a short overview of the CERN accelerator complex,
how RF is used to accelerate protons and what is White Rabbit. It
will then discuss why the RF phase is very important for an
accelerator, how clocks are synchronized, how RF is computed,
digitally distributed and locally regenerated using dedicated
electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;White Rabbit (WR) is a digital synchronization protocol over Gb Ethernet whose development is centralized by CERN with contributions from high energy physics communities including accelerators and detectors. The sub-ns synchronization capability provided by WR makes it well suited for distributed-SDR system synchronization, but the phase detection mechanism requires two tunable oscillators hardly found in generic FPGA boards. Thanks to the advances of FPGA internal clocking circuitry, WR has been demonstrated to run on generic boards not fitted with these peripherals: we demonstrate WR synchronization of the (low cost) AcornCLE215 board and Enjoy Digital's M2SDR board with some limitations over the dedicated hardware and induced by the AD936x RF frontent.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For the past decade, artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have revolutionized numerous research fields and industries.  The machine learning community has not left out software-defined Radio (SDR) and digital signal processing (DSP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this development has not been done behind closed doors, and plenty of frameworks have been released by research laboratories and industry with an open-source license. To name a few (in no particular order): Sionna (https://github.com/NVlabs/sionna), Commplax (https://github.com/remifan/commplax),  MOKka (https://github.com/kit-cel/mokka), scikit-learn &amp;amp; numpy, and maybe some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to give an overview of existing frameworks combining DSP and ML, and present a short tutorial on some aspects of what is already possible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PlutoSDR is running a minimal Linux distribution as the flash memory is limited to 32MB.
Recent clones support SD card booting which extends these capabilities to several Gigabytes.
The purpose of the presentation is to show how to take advantage of this extra storage to use the platform in a new way.
- Debian 12 based 
- Software pre-installed (Python, GNU Radio, gpredict, maia-sdr api...)
- Toolchain to achieve it :
   - Buildroot : https://github.com/F5OEO/tezuka_fw
  - rootfs :  https://github.com/F5OEO/adi-kuiper-gen
  - FPGA : https://github.com/F5OEO/maia-sdr/tree/sweep
- Web interface to use it, no need to install software on PC
- FPGA DSP support (FFT, decimation...)
- Optimizing GNU Radio flows for smoother performance 
   - Use case: Web transceiver https://github.com/F5OEO/Remote-SDR-Tezuka&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At the Dwingeloo Radio Telescope, we've developed a suite of tools that stream IQ data from SDRs using VRT (VITA 49.0 Radio Transport) over ZeroMQ to multiple clients simultaneously. This architecture enables us to run various applications—including SigMF recording, spectral analysis, pulsar dedispersion, correlation, and more—on the same data stream in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this setup, we have successfully received signals from Voyager 1, conducted lunar radar experiments in a bi-static configuration with Astropeiler Stockert, and even achieved a Venus radar bounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools are highly generic and have found applications beyond radio astronomy. In this talk, we'll provide an overview of the design philosophy and practical usage of these tools, illustrated with examples from our work at the Dwingeloo Radio Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The MAX2771 chip provides broadband (&amp;lt;44 MHz) signal processing and digitization in the lower (1.1-1.3 GHz) and upper (1.5-1.65 GHz) L-band. Initially dedicated to GNSS signal reception, two such chips clocked by a common frequency reference can be used for passive radar or direction of arrival measurements.
In this presentation, we tackle the challenges of PLL setpoint drift leading to phase variations despite the common clock, the impact of low ADC resolution on the recorded signal characteristics, and on correlation calculation. These results are not confined to this particular chip, but valid for any low SNR recordings, including for radioastronomical measurement systems. We demonstrate the use of this setup on passive radar measurements using various ground based and spaceborne sources of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the context, origins, and core concepts of the Plan 9 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will focus around Plan 9's high-level ideas that make it unique, and fundamentally different from Unix. This includes files, namespaces, the 9p protocol, networking, graphics, and the limitless potential of file servers, which can only be achieved due to its design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will aim to provide a genuine understanding of Plan 9's approach; not just what the concepts are, but why they exist and how they solve real problems that traditional Unix cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this talk assumes familiarity with Unix-like systems, it is not required to understand what will be presented. In fact, heavy assimilation with Unix tends to be a handicap rather than an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GEFS is a new file system built for Plan 9. It aims to be a crash-safe,
corruption-detecting, simple, and fast snapshotting file system, in that
order. GEFS achieves these goals by building a traditional 9p file system
interface on top of a forest of copy-on-write Bµ trees. It doesn�t try to be
optimal on all axes, but good enough for daily use.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, Plan 9 has seen many improvements and contributions and been made accessible on modern hardware by projects such as 9front. While appealing for certain tasks, audio processing has not been in the spotlight much. Despite the many ports and tools now available, information about them is splintered across many websites and code repositories and it can be difficult to piece together the overall picture. In particular, Plan 9 typically isn't known for music production, yet while it cannot approach the feature set of modern digital audio workstations (DAWs) on other systems, it is quite capable. This talk will explore the topic of audio processing on Plan 9 from a musician's perspective, show what can be done currently, and discuss its limitations and needs. Basic knowledge of Plan 9 is assumed. Topics covered: driver support, decoding/encoding, audio players, recording and editing, visualization, MIDI tools, trackers, synthesis, production.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Making the NOVA microhypervisor fit for thousands of devices and interrupts</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="microkernel">Microkernel and Component-Based OS</track>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/udosteinberg/NOVA"&gt;NOVA&lt;/a&gt; is a modern open-source (GPLv2) microhypervisor that can host and harden unmodified guest operating systems. NOVA is typically accompanied by a component-based OS that runs deprivileged and implements additional functionality, such as platform services and user-mode device drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the interrupt subsystem of modern client and server platforms has evolved significantly, by (1) scaling up from only a few pin-based to thousands of message-signaled interrupts and (2) scaling out the delivery of those interrupts across dozens or hundreds of CPU cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural differences between ARMv8-A and x86_64, such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupt types: PIN/MSI (x86) vs. (E)SPI/(E)PPI/LPI (Arm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU-local vectors (x86) vs. global INTIDs (Arm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupt remapping by IOMMU (x86) vs. interrupt translation by GIC ITS (Arm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source identifier as bus/device/function (x86) vs. device/stream ID (Arm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pose a challenge to the design of a uniform API for managing interrupts and devices and motivated the introduction of a new type of kernel object in NOVA: Device Contexts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief discussion of NOVA features added recently, the majority of the talk will focus on NOVA's new interfaces for managing hardware devices and interrupts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an overview of skiftOS’s architecture, focusing on its microkernel core and service model. It explores the design trade-offs behind keeping the kernel minimal yet practical, and the lessons learned from building a complete, usable operating system on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is aimed at developers interested in microkernels, operating system internals, and the challenges of scaling a small core into a functional ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Genode OS Framework&lt;/em&gt; is certainly not a newcomer but still under very active development. While the framework supports various third-party microkernels, its custom-tailored &lt;em&gt;base-hw&lt;/em&gt; kernel has proven valuable for putting Genode-specific (kernel) concepts to the test. One of those concepts that we have been test-driving for about a decade was the &lt;em&gt;quota-aware CPU scheduling&lt;/em&gt;, which combined CPU-quota trading with priority-based scheduling. However, with Sculpt OS as a major use case of Genode as a desktop OS that focuses on dynamic workloads, it was time to rethink what we expect from a kernel's CPU scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Johannes Schlatow and Stefan Kalkowski share the story and lessons learned from re-designing and re-implementing the kernel scheduler with a particular focus on fairness, tunable latency and ease of configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As kernels manage hardware, in certain cases the only way to prevent race conditions in kernel code is to disable interrupts. This is a kernel way of granting code exclusive access to resources at lowest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of embedded devices, it is often not feasible to keep interrupts disabled for prolonged period of time. This affects the design of portions of the kernel which modify data structures accessible from within interrupt context. Despite very limited API offered by the kernel to interrupt handlers, this still affects key data structures in kernel - scheduler table and notification table. This in turn means that any use of threading or notification API would require interrupts to be disabled for potentially prolonged time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid prolonged periods of disabled interrupts we went for some inspiration into the land of lock-free and wait-free programming. We took basic primitives used in lock-free programming and modified them to avoid excessive overhead such primitives have. The resulting mechanism is not lock-free anymore yet offers semantics which allows us to lock (disable interrupts) for much shorter and well predictable periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting mechanism resembles database transactions to certain extent. This talk will provide introduction to the transaction subsystem, reason on why it offers benefits over raw locks and elaborate on the topic "How not to loose your hair while trying to work with ever-changing data consistently".&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation describes the technical implementation of PhantomOS, an orthogonally-persistent operating system, on modern microkernel architecture using the Genode framework. The talk center on the engineering challenges encountered during the porting process, especially the adaptation of the core persistence mechanisms. The talk will also touch on work on network persistence and the added WASM runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the port, the snapshot process was reworked and separated into its own Genode component. The talk will cover how the component utilizes backlink data structures and CRC validation to achieve efficient state storage with minimal overhead. A live demonstration will showcase the reliability and performance characteristics in a real-world environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;axle OS (&lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://axleos.com/blog/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;) is a hobby microkernel and userspace which includes many home-grown utilities such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/tree/paging-demo/rust_programs/linker/src"&gt;an x86_64 assembler + ELF linker&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/tree/paging-demo/programs/subprojects/net"&gt;TCP/IP/(ARP/DNS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/tree/paging-demo/programs/subprojects/realtek_8139_driver"&gt;NIC&lt;/a&gt;/etc)]( stack, &lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/tree/paging-demo/rust_programs/sata_driver/src"&gt;SATA support&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/tree/paging-demo/rust_programs/ttf_renderer/src"&gt;TrueType renderer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/tree/paging-demo/rust_programs/gb_emu/src"&gt;GameBoy emulator&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Everything is built around message passing, from process launches and virtual memory operations, to driver events and GUI updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;axle OS lacks a GPU driver, but features a compositing desktop window manager with transparency effects and animations. Since the compositor runs on the CPU, I’ve put significant effort into making redraws as efficient and targeted as possible to create a smooth and responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll give a tour of axle’s CPU-bound compositor from first principles. We’ll go on a journey of live visualisations, seeing how each successive optimization allows the compositor to perform progressively less work per frame, building up towards a general strategy for redraws that comprehensively covers screen updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a compositor that plays optimisation tricks involves lots of testing, which can be onerous in an OS that’s primarily developed in an emulator and which must boot itself before the compositor can run. Therefore, we’ll also take a look at a host-side userspace harness I made for the compositor: the compositor can run on my host-native macOS, or as a part of the full axle OS distribution. I developed a simulator which allows me to record user interaction (such as dragging a window around with a mouse), capture the composited frames, and write a test suite that replays these events and ensures the composited frames don’t deviate from the correct output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll investigate R-trees, different compositing strategies, client request rate limiting, and the various types of redraws that the compositor must be able to handle. This talk aims to be an engaging and ‘interactive’ experience for the audience, with lots of guiding visualisations motivating each optimization we make to our compositor, following the journey towards axle OS’s contemporary CPU compositor.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since the last FOSDEM update on GNU/Hurd, so we have a lot to talk about :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver support improvement is on its way through using netbsd's rump layer, now being used in production although there are a few things left to fix. Some SMP support has been added, which should allow at least compilation to be run in parallel. Hurd support was added to the rust ecosystem, which became more and more a necessity due to various software now requiring it. The x86_64 port is essentially complete, which mostly required fixing the MIG RPC layer, and telling various software that it exists. To bootstrap the Debian GNU/Hurd x86_64 distribution, many of the crossbuilding, rebootstrapping and build profiles tools were used to make it relatively smooth. Additionally, the Guix/Hurd distribution is also on its way, as well as an Alpine/Hurd distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the first Microkernel OS Devroom at FOSDEM 2012 and culminating today, there have been exactly 15 devrooms in 15 years dedicated to microkernel-based operating systems at each FOSDEM. As surprising or shocking this may sound to somebody who has been there all along, this time period already constitutes a small piece of history. While the computing world of today is not dramatically different or unrecognizable compared to 2012, maybe except for a few "minor" technologies such as HTML5 and LLMs ;), there have definitively been some changes and shifts of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take this opportunity for a small retrospective of the last 15 years in the context of open-source microkernel-based operating systems. What problems have we been facing back then and how do they relate to the problems we face today? What have been the ups and downs? What are the important lessons learned?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, in the software industry, we already have a lot of ways to improve performance of our applications: compilers become better and better each year in the optimization field, we have a lot of tools like Linux perf and Intel VTune to analyze performance. Even algorithms are still improving in various domains! But how many of these improvements are actually adopted in the industry, and how difficult it is to adopt them in reality? That's an interesting question!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I want to show you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why accessibility of software performance matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How various software optimization approaches are different from the adoption easiness perspective: from different compiler optimizations to semi-automatic optimizations to a manual approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What things can be improved and how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many related open-source examples from my practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share with you an idea behind the "Software performance" devroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope after the talk you get an interesting perspective on software performance to think about.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;nvidia-smi reports 100% utilization, but your workload underperforms. What's missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying only on nvidia-smi is like measuring highway usage by checking if any car is present, not how many lanes are full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk reveals the metrics nvidia-smi doesn't show and introduces open source tools that expose actual GPU efficiency metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why GPU Utilization is not same as GPU Efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep dive into relevant key metrics: SM Active, SM Occupancy, and Tensor Core utilization explained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps for practical gpu profiling and active monitoring setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying bottlenecks in inference workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave understanding how to identify underutilized GPU and discover real optimization opportunities across inference workloads.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In scientific computing on supercomputers, performance should be king.
Today’s rapidly diversifying High-Performance Computing (HPC) landscape makes this increasingly difficult to achieve however...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern supercomputers rely heavily on open source software, from a Linux-based operating system to scientific applications and their vast dependency stacks. A decade ago, HPC systems were relatively homogeneous: Intel CPUs, a fast interconnect like Infininand, and a shared filesystem. Today, diversity is the norm: AMD and Intel CPUs, emerging Arm-based exascale systems like &lt;a href="https://hackmd.io/LXZmuTDdTJi-cQKkG6AZ-w"&gt;JUPITER&lt;/a&gt;, widespread acceleration with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, soon also RISC-V system architectures (like &lt;a href="https://tenstorrent.com/"&gt;Tenstorrent&lt;/a&gt;), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hardware fragmentation creates significant challenges for researchers and HPC support teams. Getting scientific software installed reliably and efficiently is more painful than ever, and that’s before even considering software performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers, once heralded as the solution for mobility-of-compute, are increasingly showing their limits. An x86_64 container image is useless on a system with Arm CPUs, and will be equally useless on RISC-V in the not so distant future. What's worse is that portable container images used today already sacrifice performance by avoiding CPU-specific instructions like AVX-512 or AVX10, potentially leaving substantial performance gains on the table. Containerization also complicates MPI-heavy workloads and introduces friction for HPC users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the &lt;a href="https://eessi.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which tackles these challenges head-on with a fundamentally different approach. EESSI is a curated, performance-optimized scientific software stack powered by open source technologies including &lt;a href="https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs"&gt;CernVM-FS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix"&gt;Gentoo Prefix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://easybuild.io/"&gt;EasyBuild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://lmod.readthedocs.io"&gt;Lmod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://computecanada.github.io/magic_castle/"&gt;Magic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io"&gt;ReFrame&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will show how EESSI enables researchers to use the same optimized software stack seamlessly across laptops, cloud VMs, supercomputers, CI pipelines, and even Raspberry Pis—without sacrificing performance or ignoring hardware differences. This unlocks powerful workflows and simplifies software management across heterogeneous environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EESSI is already being adopted across &lt;a href="https://www.eessi.io/docs/systems/"&gt;European supercomputers&lt;/a&gt; and plays a central role in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://my-eurohpc.eu"&gt;EuroHPC Federation Platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come learn why EESSI is the right way to keep the P in HPC.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Slow performance is often a major blocker of new visionary applications in scientific computing and related fields, regardless of whether it is embedded or distributed computing. This issue is becoming more and more challenging to tackle as it is no longer enough to do only algorithmic optimisations, only hardware optimisations, or only (operating) system optimisations: all of them need to be considered together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecting full-stack computer systems customised for a use case comes to the rescue, namely software-system-hardware co-design. However, doing this manually per use case is cumbersome as the search space of possible solutions is vast, the number of different programming models is substantial, and experts from various disciplines need to be involved. Moreover, performance analysis tools often used here are fragmented, with state-of-the-art programs tending to be proprietary and not compatible with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why automated full-stack system design is promising, but the existing solutions are few and far between and do not scale. &lt;strong&gt;Adaptyst is an open-source project at CERN (the world-leading particle physics laboratory) aiming to solve this problem. It is meant to be a comprehensive architecture-agnostic tool which:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unifies performance analysis across the entire software-hardware stack by calling state-of-the-art software and APIs under the hood with any remaining gaps bridged by Adaptyst (so that performance can be inspected both macro- and microscopically regardless of the workflow and platform type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suggests automatically the best solutions of workflow performance bottlenecks in terms of one or more of: software optimisations, hardware choices and/or customisations, and (operating) system design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scales easily from embedded to high-performance/distributed computing and allows adding support for new software/system/hardware components seamlessly by anyone thanks to the modular design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is in the early phase of development with small workforce and concentrating on profiling at the moment. Given that Adaptyst has broad application potential and we want it to be for everyone’s benefit, we are building an open-source community around the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is an invitation to join us: we will explain the performance problems we face at CERN, tell you in detail what Adaptyst is and how you can get involved, and demonstrate the current version of the project live on CPU and CUDA examples.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reliable performance measurement remains an unsolved problem across most open source projects. Benchmarks are often an afterthought, and when they aren't they can be noisy, non-reproducible, and hard to act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares lessons learned from building a large-scale benchmarking system at Datadog and shows how small fixes can make a big difference: controlling environmental noise, designing representative workloads, interpreting results with sound statistical methods, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll show a real case study to demonstrate how rigorous benchmarking can turn assumptions about performance into decisions backed by data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees should leave with practical principles they can apply in their own projects to make benchmarks trustworthy and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; is a distributed version control system whose codebase combines Python, C and Rust. Over its twenty years of development, significant effort has been put into its scaling and overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent 7.2 version, the performance of exchanging data between repositories (e.g. &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pull&lt;/code&gt;) has been significantly improved, with some of our most complicated benchmark cases moving from almost four hours down to 2 minutes, a speedup of over 100x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk uses this work as a case study of the multiple places where performance improvements lie.
It goes over the challenges that arise from exchanging data in a DVCS, and the levers we can pull to overcome them: higher level logic changes, lower level algorithmic improvements, programming language strengths, modern CPU architecture, network protocol design, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the great results, exchanging data in version control remains a complex matter, and we lastly expose our ideas to further tackle its inherent complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Database vendors often engage in fierce competition on system performance – in the 1980s, they even had their "benchmark wars". The creation of the TPC, a non-profit organization that defines standard benchmarks and supervises their use through rigorous audits, spelled an end to the benchmark wars and helped drive innovation on performance in relational database management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPC served as a model for defining database benchmarks, including the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC, https://ldbc.org/), of which I've been a contributor and board member for the past 5+ years. Through LDBC's workloads, graph database systems have seen a 25× speedup in four years and a 71× price-performance improvement on transactional workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining database benchmarks requires a careful balancing of multiple aspects: relevance, portability, scalability, and simplicity. Most notably, the field in the last few years has shifted toward using simpler, leaderboard-style benchmarks that skip the rigorous auditing process but allow quick iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share my lessons learned on designing database benchmarks and using them in practice. The talk has five sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need for database benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPC overview (Transaction Processing Performance Council)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDBC overview (Linked Data Benchmark Council)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current benchmark landscape (ClickBench, H2O, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takeaways for designing new benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the past 30 years we've moved from manual QA testing of release candidates to Continuous Integration and even Continuous Deployment. But while most software projects excel at testing correctness, the level of automation of performance testing is still near zero. And while it's a given that each developer writes tests for their own code, Performance Engineering remains the domain of individual experts or separate teams, who benchmark the product with custom tools developed in house, often focusing on beta and release candidates, with zero performance tests happening in the Continuous Integration work stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is your guide to Continuous Performance Engineering, aka Continuous Benchmarking.  We will cover standard benchmarking frameworks and how to automate them in CI, automating deployments of large end-to-end environments, how to tune your infrastructure for minimum noise and maximum repeatability, and using change point detection to automatically alert on performance regressions with a minimal amount of those annoying false positives.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;JSON is one of the most popular data exchange formats. Parsing routines for it exist in every modern programming languages, either built-in, or included in popular libraries such as &lt;a href="https://rapidjson.org/"&gt;RapidJSON&lt;/a&gt; for C++ or &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/json/latest/json/"&gt;json&lt;/a&gt; for Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task of conversion between JSON strings and &lt;a href="https://lua.org/"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; objects has been solved plenty of times before, but either the solutions are not focused on performance, or the parsers are too strict for the "relaxed" format we use at &lt;a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/"&gt;BeamNG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we want to have the fastest Lua table &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; relaxed JSON conversion possible? We came up with a highly optimized LuaJIT code we use for handling JSONs at [BeamNG] since a few years. But there is a way to go further - hacking on the C source code of the interpreter itself to add compiled built-in JSON support. How much extra performance can we squeeze out by going a level deeper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready for juicy benchmarks and an optimization story from a real usage perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you take a random program and start profiling it, you'll usually find that the memcpy function is at the top. However, this doesn't necessarily mean memcpy is slow. The most hopeless thing a C++/Rust developer can do (while no one is watching) is optimize memcpy to move bytes faster. That's exactly what we'll do.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Driven by application, compliance, and end-user requirements, companies opt to deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters across public and private clouds. However, deploying applications in multi-cluster environments presents distinct challenges, especially managing the communication between the microservices spread across clusters. Traditionally, custom configurations, like VPNs or firewall rules, were required to connect such complex setups of clusters spanning the public cloud and on-premise infrastructure.
This talk presents a comprehensive analysis of network performance characteristics for three popular open-source multi-cluster networking solutions (namely, &lt;a href="https://skupper.io/"&gt;Skupper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner"&gt;Submariner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://istio.io/"&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;), addressing the challenges of microservices connectivity across clusters. We evaluate key factors such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization using established tools and benchmarks, offering valuable insights for organizations aiming to optimize the network performance of their multi-cluster deployments. Our experiments revealed that each solution involves unique trade-offs in performance and resource efficiency: Submariner offers low latency and consistency, Istio excels in throughput with moderate resource consumption, and Skupper stands out for its ease of configuration while maintaining balanced performance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explore how we built comprehensive load testing for React applications at Mattermost, achieving 100,000 concurrent users in production-like environments. We'll begin by revealing why traditional API testing missed critical browser issues that only emerged at scale. Next, we'll demonstrate our open-source tool that uses Playwright to run thousands of real browsers, measuring React-specific metrics like component render times, memory leaks, and state management bottlenecks. Finally, we'll share the optimization journey that reduced browser memory and enabled true production readiness, ensuring our React application performs flawlessly for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Version control remains one of the biggest barriers to open source contribution—especially in game development, where programmers, artists, and designers must collaborate using tools like Git which are designed for code, not creative assets or interdisciplinary teams. At Ink &amp;amp; Switch, we're prototyping a new collaboration system built directly into the Godot editor, supporting real-time co-editing, branching, and visual review of changes. In partnership with the Endless Foundation, we're evaluating this system with students in introductory Godot classes. This talk will demo our progress, explore why version control poses unique challenges for game development, and share early lessons from bringing these tools to students.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 there was no way to use Full-Body Tracking in Godot based VR games or with the Wireless Vive and Spreadgine game engine. Libsurvive had support for the Vive tracker, but none of the games and middleware compatible with my computer supported Full-Body Tracking. This talk will be about extending Freedom Saber (a libre VR rhythm game) to support Full-Body Tracking and VRM avatars.&lt;br /&gt;
I will also explain how I modified Spreadgine to work with the SlimeVR Server and my Valve Index.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I'm presenting FEX, a translation layer to run x86 software on ARM devices, and the challenges it brings to the table: The design a high-performance binary recompiler, translation of Linux system calls across architectures, and forwarding of library calls to their ARM counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming in particular poses extreme demands on FEX and raises further questions: How do we enable GPU acceleration in an emulated environment? How can we integrate Wine to run Windows games on Linux ARM? Why is Steam itself the ultimate boss battle for x86 emulation? And why in the world do we care more about page sizes than German standardization institutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn why x86 is such a pain to emulate and what tricks and techniques make your games fly with minimal translation overhead. Be prepared to learn cursed knowledge you won't be able to forget!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SlimeVR is a fully open source hardware and software project turned company that produces both he required hardware and software for IMU based Full Body Tracking for VR, Motion Capture and VTubing.
Over the last 4 years we have grown from a team of 2 and a desire to make cool stuff to an industry leading company with over 10 full time employees, 29.000+ customers and an active community over on discord with 69.000+ members!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, SlimeVR uses IMU's  (Inertial Measurement Unit) to estimate a virtual skeleton that can then be used for various purposes such as: Virtual Reality games, Motion capture through VMC or with BVH files and Vtubing which has become more and more popular over the years.
Whilst we sell the hardware needed, people can also fully build their own hardware with off the shelf components!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a huge passion for open source and we love sharing our ideas and mindset with the rest of the world.
On top of that, we would love to hear from everyone else as well!
That's why we would love to attend the Gaming and VR Devroom at fosdem 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to showcase and share how we came to be, and show off some of the hardware and software that we have developed over the years.
Including our latest and greatest recently announced Butterfly trackers.
http://slimevr.dev/smol
Our software has seen tremendous strides in recent years and has been embraced by names such as Sony for their motion capture product (Mocopi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also love to show off some of the hardware in action!
If possible we could set up a demo where the avatar on screen is tracked off of the speaker in real time!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Practical ECS for Game Development in Rust with Bevy</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="gaming-and-vr-devroom">Gaming and VR devroom</track>

        <abstract>&lt;h3&gt;Short Abstraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture underpins many modern game engines and real-time simulation frameworks. Rust, with its strong guarantees around memory safety and concurrency, offers a powerful foundation for building high-performance game systems. This talk explores ECS in practice using the open-source Bevy game engine as a real-world case study. We examine how Bevy structures entities, components, and gameplay systems, how Rust’s ownership model shapes engine design, and what practical trade-offs arise between performance, safety, and flexibility when building real-time games in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECS is often presented as a cleaner alternative to object-oriented game architecture, but its real advantages and limitations only become clear once you start building real gameplay systems and chasing frame-time budgets. Working with ECS in Rust makes these trade-offs especially visible, because the compiler forces you to be explicit about data access, ownership, and parallel execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation uses the open-source Bevy game engine as a practical example of ECS in a modern game engine. I will walk through how gameplay systems are actually built using entities, components, and systems: spawning and querying entities, structuring game logic as systems, scheduling and ordering those systems, and how archetypes impact cache locality and frame performance. We will look at how Rust’s borrow checker directly shapes ECS API design, how safe parallel system execution works in practice, and where you sometimes need to rethink data layout to satisfy both the compiler and real-time performance constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating ECS as a universal solution, this talk focuses on real development experience: what works extremely well for gameplay programming in Rust, what takes time to adjust to coming from traditional engines, and when ECS is the right architectural choice for a game versus when it adds unnecessary complexity. While the examples focus on games, the same ideas naturally extend to simulations, tools, and other real-time, data-driven applications&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2002, a group of Warcraft III enthusiasts built a free community server using the open-source PvPGN project. Over twenty years and a million games later, Eurobattle.net remains one of the longest-running unofficial Warcraft III servers in existence. This talk traces its evolution from early bnetd and PvPGN roots through the rise of GHost++ and GProxy projects, which fundamentally transformed Warcraft III map hosting, to our own project forks and extensions that keep the ecosystem alive today. Attendees will learn about the architecture behind Eurobattle.net, challenges maintaining decades-old C++ stack, learn about the community aspects, and see a short live demo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When the Eliza psychotherapist chatbot was released by Joseph Weizenbaum, in 1966, people believed it real. Even the secretary of its creator thought the machine had feelings, as they discussed relationships and personal issues. But why? How could a simple computer text interface act so human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session our speaker, a computer historian and associate at the Centre for Computer History, uncovers the workings of Eliza, the Eliza effect, and its impact in the modern world and films like "THX 1138" and "Her." From the computer hardware to the programming language, and the scripts used to simulate the human traits of empathy and comprehension, we look at how 233 lines of code was convincing enough to change the world... and then how that code was transmogrified into JavaScript so that anyone can read and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk covers an evolution of widget toolkits, which have been started 40 years ago along with the historical changes in a desktop GUI. Widget toolkits are reviewed from three points of view: architecture, user experience, and programming principles. More than 90% of historically significant widget toolkits have open source licenses: some are opensourced after decrease of their commercial demand (like OpenLook and Motif), others are developed as a part of FLOSS world (TCL/TK, GTK+, QT) or in systems cloned by the open source community (GnuSTEP, Haiku OS, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewed toolkits of 1980s include early Unix GUI of Andrew Toolkit and Project Athena, followed by OpenLook and Motif, and main non-Unix toolkits: WinAPI and NextSTEP GUI. Significant toolkits of 1990s include TCL/TK, wide range of wrapper toolkits including MFC and Java AWT and Swing, and the appearance of two main Linux widget libraries, GTK+ and QT. Also the burst of visual theming occurred in the second half of 1990s is examined for Unix and Windows platforms (as in their artistic styles, so in used architectural approaches). The list of milestones is finished with the Apple Cocoa style, closing the XX century experiments (but theming efforts had 10 more years of boiling). From the architecture point of view, the talk covers the recurring efforts in the event processing techniques,  targeting at hiding callbacks from a GUI developer with available object-style metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;About one month after I was born in 1983 a company called MCI introduced their "Electronic mail" system. Originally a BBS-style system, where users dialed into MCI to edit, send, and receive mail. Users could send electronic mail to each other, send a physical letters, and even manage their telexes without ever leaving the comfort of whatever room they had with a telephone and an acoustic coupler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became necessary to have offline email clients. Rather than use SMTP or POP they came up with MEP2 (Message Exchange Protocol 2). MEP2 combines the functionality of SMTP, POP, and some LDAP features together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will discuss the history of MCI, MEP2 protocol, and the mail server I implemented that can speak it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Neo Geo, the classic cartridge-based arcade and home video game system turned 35 in 2025. By now, it has been thoroughly reverse-engineered and documented online. Recently, there has been a surge in homebrew demos and newly published homebrew games for the Neo Geo. And although development in 2026 is way easier than it was in the 90's, too many available tools are still GUI-only, closed-source or Windows-only binaries, which leaves a lot to be desired. ngdevkit [1] was born out of this observation. The ambition of this project is twofold: first, to be a fully open source, easy to use development kit; second, to prove that your entire game development workflow can rely exclusively on open source software for compiling code, creating graphics, composing chiptunes, designing sound FX...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview of C programming for the Neo Geo with ngdevkit, and will discuss the main components of this open source development kit. ngdevkit provides a toolchain that leverages binutils, GCC, newlib and SDCC for code compilation, GnGeo or Mame for code execution, and GDB for source-level debugging. It also comes with an open source reimplementation of the original Neo Geo BIOS, with full ABI compatibility. In addition, this development kit provides the necessary crt0 and runtime to boot the game processor (68k) and the sound processor (Z80), and uses a custom linkscript to expose hardware features (video RAM, backup RAM, memory mapped registers, I/O state) as regular C variables. At last, it provides the first fully open source sound driver and chiptune player on the Neo Geo hardware. Throughout the talk, we will discuss how ngdevkit was made possible thanks to a vast trove of public domain documentation and a vast collection of open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Z80 CPU has been extremely popular in home computers of the eighties, but as 16-bit and 32-bit processors became more popular, the only new computers built using the Z80 were continuations of some legacy lines (like the Amstrad PCW).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, in 1999 a company named Cidco unveiled a completely new computer line named the MailStation. with a Z80 CPU clocked at 12 MHz and 128 kB of RAM. It was a specialized machine for sending and receiving emails, addressed at people for whom configuring Web access on a PC was too complicated. Yet it was still a computer, with a screen, keyboard, means of communicating with the outside world and possibility of running user apps. Most likely the last new Z80 computer ever designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I would like to present this machine, show how it can be hacked to run custom software, and encourage the audience to join me in documenting the machine and writing custom firmware for it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The first generation of computers (vacuum tube-based) emerged from WWII for scientific, military, or business purposes. In this pioneering time, the term “mathematical machines” was also used to distinguish them from human computers.
This talk presents a working software simulator of the Belgian Mathematical Machine (MMIF), a little-known computer funded after WWII by IRSIA-FNRS and inaugurated 70 years ago at the Bell Company in Antwerp. We will show, including using the stepping mode, how it deals with programs and data using separate "RAM" drums (Harvard-style) and carries out computations with a high-precision floating-point calculation unit. You will discover the not-so-odd instruction set, coding style and how complex functions required for applications in ballistics and thermodynamics were implemented as a specific library. In addition to releasing the simulator as Open Source, the NAM-IP museum also publicly archived the available technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Who needs to build their very own 8-bit homebrew computer in 2026? I'd say everyone should, especially if you work in IT! The Memo-1 is my personal attempt at understanding computers from the transistor up to the UI: a complete 6502-based system built from scratch, using a French Minitel as a smart terminal, with sound, joystick ports and an extension slot for expansions.
In this talk, I'll share what I learned from building the Memo-1, from wiring the CPU and designing a simple bus architecture to writing a Minitel library in 6502 assembly. Beyond the nostalgia, it's been a fantastic hands-on way to rediscover and demystify how computers really work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dial-up was the main way to connect to the Internet back in the 90s. Unfortunately, within the time almost all of the dial-up service providers are shut down, because of obvious reasons. It used to connect our living room to the world via 56 kbps (or less) bandwidth rate, in comparison, modern broadband global mean is two thousand times faster. But sometimes we still need it to connect our legacy hardware to the world, retro (or lowres) computing purposes, sometimes even to circumvent censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, after a brief on the dial-up connection and it's nature, notes and methods on running a personal dial-up ISP and connecting to it will be covered; starting from hardware requirements for both ISP and client side and the software stack for GNU/Linux operating system to run a dial-up system, using only free/libre software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, interacting with computer systems through display terminals became common.  In small systems and technical computing, the RS232 serial interface with asynchronous, ASCII based protocols became the standard.  Business systems based on IBM mainframe technology, in contrast, relied on high-speed synchronous communication over coaxial cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, connecting an asynchronous serial terminal to a modern computer can easily be done using a readily available USB RS232 adapter.  A 3270 style mainframe terminal, on the other hand, requires special hard- and software infrastructure to be brought to life.
This presentation examines how terminals communicated with computers, how IBM mainframes implemented these interactions differently, and how a 3270 terminal can be used today to access both virtual and physical mainframes over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scientific models are today limited by compute resources, forcing approximations driven by feasibility rather than theory. They consequently miss important physical processes and decision-relevant regional details. Advances in AI-driven supercomputing — specialized tensor accelerators, AI compiler stacks, and novel distributed systems — offer unprecedented computational power. Yet, scientific applications such as ocean models, often written in Fortran, C++, or Julia and built for traditional HPC, remain largely incompatible with these technologies. This gap hampers performance portability and isolates scientific computing from rapid cloud-based innovation for AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present &lt;a href="https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Reactant.jl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Reactant.jl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open-source optimising compiler framework for the Julia programming language, based on MLIR and XLA. &lt;code&gt;Reactant.jl&lt;/code&gt; preserves high-level semantics (e.g. linear algebra operations), enabling aggressive cross-function, high-level optimisations, and generating efficient code for a variety of backends (CPU, GPU, TPU and more). Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;Reactant.jl&lt;/code&gt; combines with &lt;a href="https://enzyme.mit.edu/"&gt;Enzyme&lt;/a&gt; to provide high-performance multi-backend automatic differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a practical demonstration, we will show the integration of &lt;code&gt;Reactant.jl&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Oceananigans.jl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a state-of-the-art GPU-based ocean model. We show how the model can be seamlessly retargeted to thousands of distributed TPUs, unlocking orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput. This opens a path for scientific modelling software to take full advantage of next-generation AI and cloud hardware — without rewriting the codebase or sacrificing high-level expressiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of reproducible, scalable bioinformatics workflows, tools like Snakemake, Nextflow, and Galaxy have become indispensable. Yet, deploying them on high-performance computing (HPC) systems — where SLURM reigns as the dominant batch scheduler — remains fraught with challenges. This talk recounts the development of the official SLURM plugin for Snakemake (https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.29032.3; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16922261), a journey shaped less by code and more by the idiosyncrasies of HPC environments. From GPU and MPI support to threaded applications, the plugin had to accommodate diverse computational needs — but the real hurdles lay in administrative policies: login nodes off-limits, partition naming chaos, and cluster-specific layouts and policies that defy standardization. I’ll share how the plugin evolved to accommodate the needs of data analysts - from Santa Cruz to Okinawa, from Stellenbosch to Uppsala. Whether you’re a bioinformatician or analyse CERN data, are a workflow developer, or HPC admin, this talk offers a look at the messy, human side of making reproducibility work in real-world HPC landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>JUBE: An Environment for systematic benchmarking and scientific workflows</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="hpc-big-data-data-science">HPC, Big Data &amp; Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wherever research software is developed and used, it needs to be installed, tested in various ways, benchmarked, and set up within complex workflows. Typically, in order to perform such tasks, either individual solutions are implemented - imposing significant restrictions due to the lack of portability - or the necessary steps are performed manually by developers or users, a time-consuming process, highly susceptible to errors. Furthermore, particularly in the field of high-performance computing (HPC), where large amounts of data are processed and the computer systems used are unique worldwide, not only performance, scalability, and efficiency of the applications are important, but so are modern research software engineering (RSE) principles such as reproducibility, reusability, and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these challenges and requirements in mind, JUBE [1] (Jülich Benchmarking Environment) has been developed at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), enabling automated and transparent scientific workflows. JUBE is a generic, lightweight, configurable environment to run, monitor and analyze application execution in a systematic way. It is a free, open-source software implemented in Python that operates on a "definition-based" paradigm where the “experiment” is described declaratively in a configuration file (XML or YAML). The JUBE engine is responsible for translating this definition into shell scripts, job submission files, and directory structures. Due to its standardized configuration format, it simplifies collaboration and usability of research software. JUBE also complements the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) capabilities, leading to Continuous Benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce and facilitate JUBE’s usage, the documentation includes a tutorial with simple and advanced examples, an FAQ page, a description of the command line interface, and a glossary with all accepted keywords [2]. In addition, a dedicated Carpentries course offers an introduction to the JUBE framework [3] (basic knowledge of the Linux shell and either XML or YAML are beneficial when getting started with JUBE). A large variety of scientific codes and standard HPC benchmarks have already been automated using JUBE and are also available open-source [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, an overview of JUBE will be provided, including its fundamental concepts, current status, and roadmap of future developments (external code contributions are welcome). Additionally, three illustrative use cases will be introduced to offer a comprehensive understanding of JUBE's practical applications:
- benchmarking as part of the procurement of JUPITER, Europe’s first exascale supercomputer;
- a complex scientific workflow for energy system modelling [5];
- continuous insight into HPC system health by regular execution of applications, and the subsequent graphical presentation of their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUBE is a well-established software, which has already been used in several national and international projects and on numerous and diverse HPC systems [6-13]. Besides being available via EasyBuild [14] and Spack [15], further software has been built up based on JUBE [16,17]. Owing to its broad scope and range of applications, JUBE is likely to be of interest to audiences in the HPC sector, as well as those involved in big data and data science.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scaling Gmsh-based FEM on LUMI: Efficiently Handling Thousands of Partitions</title>

        <abstract>&lt;h2&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-frequency wave simulations in 3D (with e.g. Finite Elements) involve systems with hundreds of millions unknowns (up to 600M in our runs), prompting the use of massively parallel algorithms. In the harmonic regime, we favor Domain Decomposition Methods (DDMs) where local problems are solved in smaller regions (subdomains) and the full solution of the PDE is recovered iteratively. This requires each rank to own a portion of the mesh and to have a view on neighboring partitions (ghost cells or &lt;em&gt;overlaps&lt;/em&gt;). In particular, the &lt;em&gt;Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz&lt;/em&gt; algorithm requires assembling matrices at the boundary of overlaps, which requires creating additional elements after the partitioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last two years, I pushed our in-house FEM code (GmshFEM) to run increasingly large jobs, from 8 MPI ranks on a laptop, through local and national clusters, up to more than 30,000 ranks on LUMI. Each milestone provided its own challenges in the parallel implementation: as the problem size increases, simple global reductions can go from being a minor synchronization to being a major bottleneck, redundant information in partitioned meshes can eat hundreds of gigabytes of RAM, and load-balancing issues can become dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will describe how we tackled these challenges and how the future versions of Gmsh will take into account these issues. In particular, the next version of the MSH file format will be optimized to reduce data duplication across subdomains. I will also present the new API for querying information about partitioned meshes, such as retrieving elements in overlapping regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Gmsh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmsh (https://gmsh.info/) is an open-source (GPL-2) finite element mesh generator widely used in scientific and engineering applications. It provides a graphical interface, a scripting language for automation, and language bindings (C/C++, Fortran, Python, Julia). In this work, Gmsh serves as the front-end mesh generator for large-scale distributed FEM simulations using our in-house solver GmshFEM (https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/fem).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Productive Parallel Programming with Chapel and Arkouda</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As the computing needs of the world have grown, the need for parallel systems has grown to match. However, the programming languages used to target those systems have not had the same growth. General parallel programming targeting distributed CPUs and GPUs is frequently locked behind low-level and unfriendly programming languages and frameworks. Programmers must choose between parallel performance with low-level programming or productivity with high-level languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chapel-lang.org/"&gt;Chapel&lt;/a&gt; is a programming language for productive parallel programming that scales from laptops to supercomputers. This talk will focus on the ways that Chapel addresses the above gap, giving programmers used to high level languages like Python access to distributed parallel performance. Chapel has long been open-source, but recently moved to become one of the many amazing projects hosted under the &lt;a href="https://hpsf.io/"&gt;High Performance Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will include a description of Chapel and its performance as well as a few examples of Chapel programs. I will also present Arkouda, an exploratory data science tool for massive scales of data. Arkouda is built in Chapel and completely closes the accessibly gap for Python programmers to access supercomputer-scale data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Track Energy &amp; Emissions of User Jobs on HPC/AI Platforms using CEEMS</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the rapid acceleration of ML/AI research in the last couple of years, the already energy-hungry HPC platforms have become even more demanding. A major part of this energy consumption is due to users’ workloads and it is only by the participation of end users that it is possible to reduce the overall energy consumption of the platforms. However, most of the HPC platforms do not provide any sort of metrics related to energy consumption, nor the performance metrics out of the box, which in turn do not encourage end users to optimize their workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Compute Energy &amp;amp; Emissions Monitoring Stack (CEEMS) has been designed to address this issue. CEEMS can report energy consumption and equivalent emissions of user workloads in real time for SLURM (HPC), Openstack (Cloud) and Kubernetes platforms alike.  It leverages the Linux perf subsystem and eBPF to monitor the performance metrics of the applications, which can help the end users to identify the bottlenecks in their workflows rapidly and consequently optimize them to reduce the energy and carbon footprint. CEEMS supports eBPF-based continuous profiling and it is the first monitoring stack to support continuous profiling on HPC platforms. Another advantage of CEEMS is that it can systematically monitor all the jobs on the platform without the end users having to modify their workflows or codes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides CPU energy usage, it supports reporting energy usage and performance metrics of workloads on NVIDIA and AMD GPU accelerators. CEEMS has been built around the prominent open-source tools in the observability ecosystem, like Prometheus and Grafana. CEEMS has been designed to be extensible and it allows the HPC center operators to easily define the energy estimation rules of user workloads based on the underlying hardware. CEEMS monitors I/O and network metrics in a file system agnostic manner, allowing it to work on any parallel file system used by HPC platforms. Finally, the talk will conclude by showing how CEEMS monitoring is used on the Jean-Zay HPC platform with more than 2000 nodes that have a daily job churn rate of around 20k jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Partly Cloudy with a Chance of Zarr: A Virtualized Approach to Zarr Stores from ECMWF Fields Database</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="hpc-big-data-data-science">HPC, Big Data &amp; Data Science</track>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="www.ecmwf.int"&gt;ECMWF&lt;/a&gt; manages petabytes of meteorological data critical for weather and climate research. But traditional storage formats pose challenges for machine learning, big-data analytics, and on-demand workflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a solution which introduces a Zarr store implementation for creating virtual views of ECMWF’s Fields Database (FDB), enabling users to access GRIB data as if it were a native Zarr dataset. Unlike existing approaches such as VirtualiZarr or Kerchunk, our solution leverages the domain-specific MARS language to define virtual Zarr v3 stores directly from scientific requests, bridging GRIB and Zarr for dynamic, cloud-native access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is developed as part of the &lt;a href="https://warmworld.de/"&gt;WarmWorld Easier&lt;/a&gt; project, aiming to make climate and weather data more interoperable and accessible for the scientific community. By combining the efficiency of FDB with the flexibility of Zarr, we unlock new possibilities for HPC, big-data analytics, and machine learning pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore the architecture, discuss performance considerations, and demonstrate how virtual Zarr views accelerate integration in open-source workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will:
    - Explain the motivation behind creating virtual Zarr views of ECMWF’s Fields Database. 
    - Detail the design and implementation of a custom Zarr Store that translates Zarr access patterns into MARS requests. 
    - Discuss performance trade-offs and scalability in HPC contexts. 
    - Showcase real-world examples of how this approach may support data science workflows, machine learning, and distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Zero‑Touch HPC Nodes: NetBox, Tofu and Packer for a Self‑Configuring SLURM Cluster</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the last five years, we ran an HPC system for life sciences on top of OpenStack, with a deployment pipeline built from Ansible, manual steps (see &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/hpc_openstack/"&gt;FOSDEM 2020 talk&lt;/a&gt;). It worked—but it wasn’t something we could easily rebuild from scratch or apply consistently to other parts of our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we designed our new HPC system (coming online in early 2026), we set ourselves a goal: treat the cluster as something we can declare and then recreate, not pet and nurture. The result is a “zero‑touch” style pipeline where a new node can go from “just racked” to “in SLURM and running jobs” with no manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we walk through the end‑to‑end workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NetBox as DCIM and source of truth: racking a server and adding it to NetBox is the trigger; MACs, serials and IPs are automatically imported from vendor tools and IPAM/DNS into our automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Tofu/Terragrunt (instead of Openstack's Heat orchestration service) to provision OpenStack/Ironic, SLURM infrastructure and network fabric across three environments (dev plus two interchangeable prod clusters for blue/green rollouts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image‑based deployment with Packer and Ansible: we split roles into “install” and “configure”. Packages and heavy setup are baked into images, while an ansible-init service runs locally on first boot to apply configuration and join the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making nodes self‑sufficient, including fetching the secrets they need via short‑lived credentials and a minimal external dependency chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pitfalls: cloud‑init bugs in non‑standard setups, weirdness with multiple datasources and host types, and how we worked around them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and see how we built a reproducible HPC/Big-Data cluster on open‑source tooling, reusing as much of the stack as possible for the rest of our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speakers:
Ümit Seren and Leon Schwarzäugl are HPC systems engineers at the Vienna BioCenter home to 3 life science institutes. Over the past years, they helped design, deploy and operate an OpenStack‑based HPC cluster and are now leading the automation and deployment architecture of the new HPC system coming online in 2026. Their interests include bare‑metal automation, reproducible infrastructure, high‑throughput computing and making complex systems easier to operate and debug.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with large amounts of biological data. The advent of transformer models applied to this field brought very interesting scientific innovations, including the introduction of Protein Language Models (PLMs) and Antibody Language Models (AbLMs). The complexity of training or fine tuning PLMs/AbLMs along with inference tasks requires a non-trivial amount of GPU resources and a disciplined approach, where DevOps and MLOps methodologies fit very well. In this session we will present a series of tasks related to fine tuning PLMs/AbLMs for classification of SARS-CoV-2's spike proteins. We will highlight how Kubernetes can be used to execute large numbers of computationally intensive tasks on GPU hosts, including best practices for sharing Nvidia GPUs (MIG, Time Slicing, MPS) as part of an open source stack orchestrated with Apache Airflow. While these methodologies can be applied to any Kubernetes cluster, including on hyperscalers, this talk is meant to facilitate the (re)use of on-prem hardware infrastructure, presenting a fully open-source stack that can be easily deployed and maintained on bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Observability for AI Workloads on HPC: Beyond GPU Utilization Metrics</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When you run LLMs or large-scale ML training on HPC clusters, traditional monitoring falls short. GPU utilization at 95% tells you nothing about model quality. Memory bandwidth looks healthy while your inference latency silently degrades. Your job scheduler reports success while concept drift erodes prediction accuracy.
This talk introduces a practical observability framework specifically designed for AI workloads on HPC infrastructure, what I call "Cognitive SLIs" (Service Level Indicators for AI systems).
I'll cover three critical gaps in current HPC monitoring:
1. Model-aware metrics that matter
2. GPU observability beyond utilization
3. Energy and cost accountability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demo shows a complete stack built with open source tools: Victoria metrics with custom AI-specific exporters, Grafana dashboards designed for ML engineers (not just sysadmins), and OpenTelemetry instrumentation patterns for PyTorch/JAX workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with the following resources :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)Architecture patterns for instrumenting HPC AI workloads
2) Victoria Metrics  recording rules and alerting strategies for ML metrics
3)Grafana dashboard templates (GitHub repo provided)
4) Understanding of how AI Act logging requirements intersect with HPC operations&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/"&gt;JAX&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source Python package for high-performance numerical computing. It provides a familiar NumPy style interface but with the advantages of allowing computations to be dispatched to accelerator devices such as graphics and tensor processing units, and supporting transformations to automatically differentiate, vectorize and just-in-time compile functions. While extensively used in machine learning applications, JAX's design also makes it ideal for scientific computing tasks such as simulating numerical models and fitting them to data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce JAX's interface and computation model, and discuss my experiences in developing two open-source software tools that exploit JAX as a key dependency: &lt;a href="https://github.com/astro-informatics/s2fft"&gt;S2FFT&lt;/a&gt;, a Python package providing Fourier-like transforms for spherical data and &lt;a href="github.com/matt-graham/mici"&gt;Mici&lt;/a&gt;, a Python package implementing algorithms for fitting probabilistic models to data. I will also introduce the &lt;a href="https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/#"&gt;Python Array API standard&lt;/a&gt; and explain how it can be used to write portable code which works across JAX, NumPy and other array backends.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>ROCm™ on TheRock(s)</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ROCm™ has been AMD’s software foundation for both high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads and continues to support the distinct needs of each domain. As these domains increasingly converge, ROCm™ is evolving into a more modular and flexible platform. Soon, the distribution model shifts to a core SDK with domain-specific add-ons—such as HPC—allowing users to select only the components they need. This reduces unnecessary overhead while maintaining a cohesive and interoperable stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support this modularity, AMD transitions to TheRock, an open-source build system that enables component-level integration, nightly and weekly builds, and streamlined delivery across the ROCm™ stack. TheRock is designed to handle the complexity of building and packaging ROCm™ in a way that’s scalable and transparent for developers. It plays a central role in how ROCm™ is assembled and delivered, especially as the platform moves toward more frequent and flexible release cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover the entire development and delivery pipeline—from the consolidation into three super-repos to how ROCm™ is built, tested, and shipped. This includes an overview of the development process, the delivery mechanism, TheRock’s implementation, and the testing infrastructure. We’ll also explain how contributors can engage with ROCm™—whether through code, documentation, or domain-specific enhancements—making it easier for developers to help shape the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Are HPC users autonomous?  How much flexibility does one have whendeploying software on a supercomputer?  How close to one’s laptop development environment is it?  How have EasyBuild, Spack, Guix, and Apptainer helped improve the situation in the past decade?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will look at the situation with lucidity.  While Spack and EasyBuild enable software deployment by users, their primary user base appears to be HPC system administrators.  Thus most HPC admins let users bring their own Singularity/Apptainer images when their needs are not satisfied—effectively “giving up” on complex deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave and fearless, the Guix-HPC effort has not given up on the goal of putting reproducible package management in the hands of users, with successes and disappointments.  I will report on our experience with Tier-2 supercomputers now providing Guix, and on ongoing work with French national supercomputers (“Tier-1”) as part of NumPEx, the French national program for HPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look back at the set of challenges overcome in past years—from supporting rootless execution of the build daemon, to making the bring-your-own-MPI approach viable and to enhancing support for CPU micro-architecture optimizations—and those yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Spack v1.0 and Beyond: Managing HPC Software Stacks</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="hpc-big-data-data-science">HPC, Big Data &amp; Data Science</track>

        <abstract>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spack is a flexible multi-language package manager for HPC, Data Science, and AI, designed to support multiple versions, configurations, and compilers of software on the same system. Since the last FOSDEM, the Spack community has reached a major milestone with the release of Spack v1.0, followed closely by v1.1. This talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the "What's New" in these releases, highlighting the changes that improve robustness, performance, and user experience. We will cover among other things the shift to modeling compilers as dependencies, the package repository split, and the new jobserver-aware parallel installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of Spack v1.0 in July 2025 and v1.1 in November 2025, the project has introduced significant architectural changes and new features requested by the community. In this talk, we will dive into the key features introduced across these releases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compilers as dependencies.&lt;/strong&gt; Spack has fulfilled an old promise from FOSDEM 2018. Compilers are modeled as first-class dependencies, dependency resolution is more accurate, and binary distribution and ABI compatibility checks are more robust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;separation of the package repository&lt;/strong&gt; from the core tool and the introduction of a versioned Package API allows users to pin the package repository version independently from Spack itself and enables regular package repository releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel builds with a new user interface.&lt;/strong&gt; Spack has a new scheduler that coordinates parallel builds using the POSIX jobserver protocol, allowing efficient resource sharing across all build processes. The decades-old jobserver protocol is experiencing a major renaissance, adopted recently by Ninja v1.13 (July 2025) and the upcoming LLVM 22 release. We’ll talk about how this enables composable parallelism across make, ninja, cargo, GCC, LLVM, Spack, and other tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expected Prior Knowledge / Intended Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at Research Software Engineers (RSEs), HPC system administrators, and Data Scientists who use or manage software stacks. Familiarity with Spack is helpful but not strictly required; the talk will be accessible to anyone interested in package management and software reproducibility in scientific computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the &lt;a href="https://eessi.io/"&gt;European Environment for Scientific Software Installations&lt;/a&gt; (EESSI) was &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/eessi/"&gt;introduced at FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; as a pilot project for improving software distribution and deployment everywhere, from HPC environments, to cloud environments or even a personal workstation or a Raspberry Pi . Since then, it has gained wide adoption across &lt;a href="https://eessi.io/docs/systems/"&gt;dozens of HPC systems&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, being installed natively in EuroHPC systems and becoming a component within the &lt;a href="https://my-eurohpc.eu/"&gt;EuroHPC Federation Platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will highlight the progress EESSI has made, including the addition of new &lt;a href="https://www.eessi.io/docs/software_layer/cpu_targets/"&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eessi.io/docs/software_layer/gpu_targets/"&gt;GPU&lt;/a&gt; targets, with broader support for modern computing technologies and much &lt;a href="https://www.eessi.io/docs/available_software/overview"&gt;more software&lt;/a&gt;, featuring 600+ unique software projects (or over 3500 if you count individual Python packages and R libraries that are included) shipped with it. EESSI's capabilities have expanded significantly, turning it into a key service for managing and deploying software across a wide range of infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will provide an overview of the current status of EESSI, focusing on its new capabilities, the integration with tools like &lt;a href="https://spack.io/"&gt;Spack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.openondemand.org/"&gt;Open OnDemand&lt;/a&gt;, as well as its growing software ecosystem. Through a live hands-on demo, we will showcase how EESSI is being used in real-world HPC environments and cloud systems, and discuss the future direction of the platform. Looking ahead, we will cover upcoming features and improvements that will continue to make EESSI a solid enabler for HPC software management in Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Using OpenMP's interop for calling GPU-vendor libs with GCC</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GPU vendors provide highly optimized libraries for math operations such as fast Fourier transformation or linear algebra (FFT, (sparse)BLAS/LAPACK, …) to perform those on devices. And OpenMP is a popular, vendor-agnostic method for parallelization on the CPU but increasingly also for offloading calculations to the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how OpenMP can be used to reduce to reduce vendor-specific code, make calling it more convenient, and to combine OpenMP offloading with those libraries. While the presentation illustrates the use with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the feature is a generic feature of OpenMP 5.2, extended in 6.0, and is supported by multiple compilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of OpenMP features, the 'interop' directive provides the interoperability support, the 'declare variant' directive with the 'adjust_args' and 'append_args' clauses enable to write neater code; means for memory allocation and memory transfer and running code blocks on the GPU ('target' construct) complete the required feature set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;OpenMP specification,&lt;/strong&gt; current, past and future version, errata and example documents can be found at https://www.openmp.org/specifications/; a list of compilers and tools for OpenMP is at https://www.openmp.org/resources/openmp-compilers-tools/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC's OpenMP documentation&lt;/strong&gt; is available at https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/ (API routines, implementation status, …) and, in particular, the supported interop foreign runtimes are documented at https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/Offload-Target-Specifics.html; GCC supports offloading to Nvidia and AMD GPUs. GCC supports OpenMP interop since GCC 15, including most of the OpenMP 6.0 additions, including the Fortran API routines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Verilog-AMS in Gnucap</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gnucap is a free/libre versatile and modern, modular, analog and mixed-signal simulator. Verilog-AMS is a standardised behavioural language for analog and mixed-signal systems based on the IEEE 1364-2005 industry standard, commonly known as Verilog. Verilog and its extensions offer a portable representation for circuits and device models consistent across application domains.  With funding from NLnet we are pushing for standardisation in an otherwise heterogeneous environment of traditional and incompatible tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a first open source (and free/libre) Verilog-AMS implementation. It consists of extensions for Gnucap that elaborate circuits represented in Verilog, provide suitable simulation algorithms and interface with artifacts from related projects. The companion tool Modelgen-Verilog deals with behavioural models for mixed-signal devices, turning them into plugins for Gnucap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will explain the need for standard support in free software tools and summarise the developments since FOSDEM-25. We have filled gaps in the simulator infrastructure and extended the standard coverage vastly improving the user experience. We will outline some related ongoing activities, e.g. on porting open source PDKs to Verilog, on the Qucs schematic editor and on device libraries as well as testing and QA.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PCB design often require a lot of exchange with mechanical CAD softwares especially when the mechanical integration has a lot of constraints. Today, most of the time, the ECAD/MCAD collaboration is done through STEP, DXF, SVG, or other file formats, and usually a combination of several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IDX protocols aims at using a single protocol, that will keep tracks of the changes incrementally as the design goes on, and even use a shared library of components, bridging the gap between the electrical and the mechanical worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implemented in KiCad at first, it will allow interfacing with most commercial MCAD softwares used in the industry, and certainly pave the way for the open source ones.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Just about a year ago I started on my 3rd attempt at building a new FreeCAD workbench to provide bidirectional syncing between FreeCAD and KiCAD with a focus on multiple boards and minimal user interaction. With KiCAD v9 being release with it's new long-term API it made sense to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a followup to my KiCon 2025 which I will detail some of the progress that has been made since, and impressions of the KiCAD API as I've used it more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of different IoT devices on the market. To control them, you currently have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the vendor’s cloud service.
This approach has many problems: there is no interoperability between different vendors, so you end up installing 10 different cloud apps for 10 different devices; there are privacy concerns; and anything beyond the basics usually requires paid features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use an open-source platform such as Home Assistant, OpenHAB, Domoticz, FHEM, PiDome, or Majordomo.
These platforms are powerful but often too complex, time-consuming to learn, and relatively expensive to run—typically EUR 100+ and tens or even hundreds of hours of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no simple, easy-to-use, and low-cost solution on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We accepted this challenge and are now designing an open-source hardware solution running Free/Libre Open Source Software. Our goal is a device that costs around EUR 20 for the end user, offers more functionality than typical vendor cloud services, and remains fully open for modification and customization by anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six months of work, we already have a functioning hardware prototype and software that supports basic features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will discuss the challenges we encountered, demonstrate our current progress, and highlight the major obstacles we are facing. If others share a similar interest, your help and collaboration are very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LibrePCB 2.0 is an exciting milestone of our mission to provide an easy-to-use, modern, Open-Source PCB design software. With its completely redesigned user interface and new design concepts, the productivity and general user experience have been significantly improved. In this talk I will demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of LibrePCB 2.0, including other new features and improvements beyond its new UI. Also you will get an update about other aspects of the LibrePCB project, like our funding status or why &amp;amp; how we started the transition from C++/Qt to more modern technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://librepcb.org/"&gt;LibrePCB&lt;/a&gt; is an Open-Source EDA software to design PCBs, providing the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform: Windows/Linux/MacOS/Others | x86/ARM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intuitive &amp;amp; easy-to-use UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful library concept&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I'm the developer of the Flipper Blackhat, a 100% open source WiFi addon board for your Flipper Zero. Unlike other modules, it doesn't use an ESP32, but a Allwinner Linux SoM. The question I hear most often is: "What’s the point of the Flipper Zero?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blackpants are a carrier board for the Blackhat, and my answer to this question. No longer do you need the Flipper Zero!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll overview all the hardware and software of both the Blackpants and the Blackhat and my journey throughout developing the device! &lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We're members of a hacker team that made &lt;a href="https://blepis.0xlina.gay"&gt;Blepis&lt;/a&gt;, a hacker-friendly and fully open-source Linux PDA. The Blepis project is a continuation of &lt;a href="https://beepy.sqfmi.com/"&gt;Beepy PDA&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/06/04/the-blackberry-keyboard-how-an-open-source-ecosystem-sprouts/"&gt;was made possible&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a string of open-source hardware projects. We're here to tell you that story, share our own radical open-source strategy and how it's already been helping other open-source PDA projects grow, and also tell more about our project's journey.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Developing hardware is hard. It's quite literally in the name. Building a global open source collaboration is also hard, and even harder when every new contributor needs to source physical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general the hardware development toolchain is locked down vastly expensive walled gardens, limiting contribution and collaboration to well funded organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how the OpenFlexure Microscope project uses (and abuses) a whole toolchain of open source software to manage, automate, and accelerate the design of a lab-grade microscope in use all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenCascade Technology (OCCT) serves as the geometric backbone for the open-source CAD/CAM ecosystem, powering major platforms like FreeCAD, KiCad, and numerous industrial IFC viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, the member of OCCT3D (Capgemini Engineering) will unveil the roadmap and technical achievements of the upcoming Version 8.0.0 release. We will discuss the architectural evolution required to support modern modeling challenges and the balance between industrial robustness and open-source flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key topics will include:
* The 8.0.0 Milestone: A breakdown of major breaking changes, API cleanups, and the transition strategies for developers.
* Core Algorithms: Improvements in Boolean operations, meshing robustness, and tolerance handling.
* Interoperability: Updates on data exchange formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is essential for developers relying on OCCT for their applications and users interested in the future of the underlying kernel that drives open hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Electrical Rule Checks (ERC) in a CAD design software are a set of heuristic checks to help spotting potential mistakes in schematics.
However, they have subtleties and quirks, which can lead people to fight against them instead of using them to their full potential.
In this talk, I will discuss some of the pain points I have experienced or have whitnessed people experience while using ERC, give some tips, and encourage people to use them and even try and improve them even more. It will be illustrated by a few real-life blunders that a good use of ERC could have prevented. TL;DR: I love ERC.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Externally verifying Linux’s real-time deadline scheduling capabilities</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A number of industrial applications now demand hard real-time scheduling capabilities from the kernel of a Linux-based operating system, but scheduling measurements from the system itself cannot be completely trusted as they are referenced to the same clock as the kernel-under-test. Yet, if the system can output signals to hardware as it runs, their timing can be analysed by an external microcontroller, and a second "external" measurement obtained to compare with the system's own report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codethink wrote embedded Rust firmware to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico which analyses the timings of characters received on a UART serial port. On the other end of the serial port is our "Rusty Worker": a Rust program on a Linux system which uses the &lt;code&gt;sched_setattr&lt;/code&gt; syscall to request that Linux schedules it with specified parameters, and then measures its own scheduling period and runtime. The single-threaded and interrupt-based architecture of this firmware allowed accurate external measurements of the Rusty Worker’s scheduling parameters at microsecond precision, and meant it was easy to extend to monitor the "petting" behaviour of a watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust was a natural choice for the verification firmware and Rusty Worker. Higher level or interpreted languages would increase non-determinism and reduce our confidence in the accuracy of the collected timing data, whereas C or C++ programs risk undefined behaviour unacceptable in a safety-related context. Yet, Rust really came into its own with the relative simplicity of the cargo toolchain for embedded targets, so reproducibly building the firmware with a self-built toolchain (and without access to the internet) was just as straightforward as building the Rusty Worker for a Linux target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having equipped our suite of bare-metal CI runners with KiCad-designed custom PCBs that feature a Raspberry Pi Pico and Debug Probe, we are able to run “soak” tests to collect thousands of self- and externally-measured deadline scheduling parameters for each iteration of our &lt;a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/ctrl-os.html"&gt;Codethink Trustable Reproducible Linux (CTRL OS)&lt;/a&gt;, as soon as engineers push a new commit. We then use the open source &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/CodethinkLabs/trustable/trustable"&gt;Eclipse Trustable Software Framework (TSF)&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate automatic “real time” aggregation and statistical analysis of the external scheduling measurements for each commit, clearly communicating the results and trends to senior stakeholders and junior engineers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSF challenges us both to robustly, systematically, and continuously evidence our claims about Linux’s capabilities as a real-time operating system, and to scrutinise the software used for testing as strictly as the software under test. We are excited to share how we work towards these goals with external scheduling measurements and embedded Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OS kernel development is often connected with time consuming testing process and non-trivial debug technics. Although emulators like QEMU and Bochs ease this work significantly, nothing can compare with convenience of userspace developer environment. Moving parts of the kernel to the userspace binary is not straightforward, especially if the kernel has almost no compatibility with POSIX and is written entirely in assembly. Still, sometimes it is doable. The talk shares experience, architecture and design decisions of compiling VFS, block, and some other subsystems of KolibriOS as Linux® interactive shell program and a FUSE filesystem. Implemented unit testing framework and coverage collection tool for assembly (flat assembler) programs are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lightning talk about a project that implements a hardware-in-the-loop testing framework for validating Linux distributions on specific development boards. The system uses a universal testing harness that automatically detects target hardware platforms and adapts generic testing scripts to board-specific configurations with Claude AI help. 
 Platform adaptation is achieved through specific configuration files that define board-specific parameters, enabling the same testing codebase to validate different hardware capabilities. The GitHub Actions CI/CD integration provides automated testing across multiple platforms, with matrix-based execution that flashes appropriate images and runs comprehensive validation including hardware-specific feature testing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The ci-multiplatform project is a generic, OCI-based multi-architecture CI system designed to make cross-platform testing practical for open-source projects using GitLab CI. Originally created while enabling RISC-V support for Pixman (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pixman/pixman), it has since grown into an independent project under the RISE (RISC-V Software Ecosystem) umbrella: https://gitlab.com/riseproject/CI/ci-multiplatform, with a mirror on freedesktop.org: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pixman/ci-multiplatform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project provides multi-arch layered OCI images (Base GNU, LLVM, Meson) based on Debian, GitLab Component-style templates, and fully automated downstream test pipelines for the included examples. It supports creating customized OCI images, building and testing across 16 Linux and Windows targets – including x86, ARM, RISC-V, MIPS, and PowerPC – using unprivileged GitLab runners with QEMU user-mode emulation. Architecture-specific options (e.g., RISC-V VLEN configuration) allow developers to exercise multiple virtual hardware profiles without any physical hardware, all within a convenient job-matrix workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk covers how the system is engineered, tested, and validated across multiple GitLab instances, and what happens when unprivileged runners, QEMU quirks, toolchain differences, and architecture-specific behaviours all converge in a single pipeline. I will show how projects can adopt ci-multiplatform with minimal effort and turn multi-arch CI from a maintenance burden into a routine part of upstream development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing is central to modern software quality, yet many widely used Fortran codebases still lack automated tests. Existing tests are often limited to coarse end-to-end regression checks that provide only partial confidence. With the growth of open-source Fortran tools, we can now bring unit testing and continuous validation to legacy and modern Fortran projects alike.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk surveys the current landscape of Fortran testing frameworks before focusing on three I have evaluated in practice — pFUnit, test-drive and veggies — and explaining why pFUnit is often the most robust choice. I will discuss its JUnit-inspired design, use of the preprocessor, and the compiler idiosyncrasies that can still make adoption challenging. I will examine the hurdles that make testing Fortran hard: global state, oversized subroutines, legacy dependencies, and compiler-specific behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will then present community-oriented efforts to improve testing practices in Fortran, including development of an open-source Carpentries-style training course on testing in Fortran, with plans to expand into a broader introduction to sustainable Fortran development using open-source linting and documentation tools such as Fortitude and Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will gain practical guidance for introducing effective testing into existing Fortran codebases, and insight into current efforts towards modern workflows that support reproducibility and continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The CI/CD server Jenkins provides powerful build-quality visualizations through plugins such as &lt;a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/"&gt;Warnings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/coverage/"&gt;Coverage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-forensics/"&gt;Git Forensics&lt;/a&gt;. These plugins aggregate and visualize data from static analysis tools, coverage reports, software metrics, and Git history, enabling teams to track quality trends across builds. We have now brought this functionality to other widely used CI/CD platforms, including GitHub Actions and GitLab CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents portable, UI-independent implementations of these capabilities for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI: the &lt;a href="https://github.com/uhafner/quality-monitor"&gt;quality monitor&lt;/a&gt; GitHub Action and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/uhafner/autograding-gitlab-action"&gt;GitLab autograding-action&lt;/a&gt;. Both tools share a common architecture and codebase with the Jenkins plugins. They automatically analyze pull requests and branch pipelines, generate structured comments and concise Markdown summaries, and enforce configurable quality gates. The solutions are language-agnostic and integrate seamlessly with more than 150 static analysis, coverage, test, and metrics report formats—including Checkstyle, SpotBugs, SARIF, JUnit, JaCoCo, GoCov, and GCC. Additionally, both tools provide an autograding mode for educational use, enabling instructors to assess student submissions through a flexible, configurable point-based scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CI/CD with Gerrit, AI-Enhanced Review, and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing in Jenkins Pipelines
This presentation will explore advanced Continuous Integration (CI) strategies essential for open-source embedded systems development, moving beyond standard software testing to encompass physical hardware validation. We will begin by establishing the necessity of integrating rigorous unit and integration testing directly into the development workflow, demonstrating how to effectively define these steps within Jenkins Declarative Pipelines (DSL). The core of our approach involves deep integration with Gerrit Code Review, ensuring that tests and static analysis are triggered automatically upon every patch set creation, providing fast feedback to developers.
A significant portion of the talk will focus on achieving true end-to-end validation through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing. We will detail the implementation of Labgrid, an open-source tool used to manage and control remote hardware resources (such as embedded boards and IoT devices). This integration allows the Jenkins pipeline to reserve, provision, and execute automated, system-level tests directly on physical target devices before firmware changes are merged.
Furthermore, we will introduce two critical elements for pipeline stability and code quality. Firstly, we will demonstrate the utility of an AI-Powered Error Explanation component (e.g., via the Explain Error Plugin). This feature leverages large language models to analyze complex Jenkins log files and pipeline failures, translating cryptic errors into human-readable insights and suggested fixes, which dramatically cuts down debugging time. Secondly, we will showcase the Warnings Next Generation (Warning-NG) Plugin, which serves as a central aggregator, collecting and visualizing issues and potential vulnerabilities reported by various static analysis tools, thereby enforcing strict, quantifiable quality gates within the CI process. Attendees will gain practical, cutting-edge insights into implementing a robust, AI and hardware-enhanced CI/CD workflow suitable for modern open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The problem with the current most commonly accepted way of running code reviews using Pull Requests is that they have the nasty habit of blocking the flow of delivery. They introduce a cost of delay. Any delay reduces feedback. Consequently, it drives down quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual way to achieve fast, efficient and effective Continuous Code Reviews without disrupting the flow of delivery is through Pair Programming or Team Programming. However, for various valid reasons, these can be a cultural stretch for many teams and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, a novice team practising trunk-based development set in place a fairly uncommon but efficient alternative to implementing continuous code reviews on mainline without ever blocking the flow of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This team went from a bunch of rag-tags to becoming a reference team within the organisation, with auditors falling to the floor due to the high quality the team delivered.
Target audience: software engineers, test engineers, infrastructure engineers, team leads, engineering managers, CTOs&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With everything changing in tech at a frenetic pace, the emphasis on developer productivity has overshadowed the true essence of developer experience (DevEx). While frameworks like SPACE, getDX, and DORA metrics provide valuable insights, they often miss the mark on capturing developers' real, day-to-day experiences using tools and services, instead focusing strictly on the bottom line for the company. Meanwhile, developers and practitioners are job-hopping more than ever. 
This talk will explore the origins and evolution of "developer experience," dissect popular frameworks, and advocate for a more balanced approach that values the practitioner's perspective. At the end we will set a path towards integrating top-down metrics with bottom-up feedback, ensuring an approach to developer experience that fosters innovation and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Even with robust CI/CD, production rollouts can hit unexpected snags. While in Kubernetes Argo Rollouts excels at Progressive Delivery and automated rollbacks to mitigate deployment issues, what if we could go a step further?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session explores how to elevate your release process by integrating Agentic AI and asynchronous coding agents, with Argo Rollouts canary deployments. We'll demonstrate how an intelligent agent can automatically analyze a rollout failure, pinpointing the root cause. Beyond diagnosis, these agents can take proactive steps on your behalf, suggesting and even implementing code fixes as new pull requests, which can be redeployed automatically after PR review. This approach moves us closer to truly self-healing deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us to learn how to combine the power of Kubernetes and Argo Rollouts with the autonomous capabilities of Agentic AI, achieving a release experience that is not only seamless but also resilient.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We love ArgoCD, but it creates a classic "map vs. territory" problem. We treat Git as our "map", our single source of truth. But the cluster is the "territory", and it's often more complex than the map shows.
This becomes a crisis with the 3 AM hotfix: an SRE fixes production, changing the territory. ArgoCD, loyal to the map, sees this as drift and helpfully overwrites the fix, re-breaking the cluster.
The problem is that Git isn't our Truth, it's our Intention. This talk introduces a pragmatic solution: Cluster-Scoped Snapshotting. We’ll show a simple pattern that dumps the entire live cluster state (the "territory") into its own "reality" Git repo. To automate this, we wrote a small open-source tool called Kalco, but the pattern is the real takeaway.
This "reality" repo gives us a powerful "pre-flight diff" in our CI pipeline, comparing our "intention" (the app repo) against the "truth" (the snapshot repo). This simple check lets us bootstrap existing clusters, create a complete audit log, and stop our pipeline before it merges a change that conflicts with a critical live fix.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We've all heard that we should test our software, but what happens when we don't? Sometimes, it leads to strange and unexplainable events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is 'testing more' always the right solution? What do these bugs reveal about software and its failures? And how can we use these lessons to build more resilient systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's explore together the most bizarre software bugs in history!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Forgotten files, incomplete system info, back and forward emails... Bug reporting can be messy process and sometimes wastes a lot of time on both developer and user side. However, a lot of it can be normalized and automated.
In this talk we introduce CLI tool &lt;strong&gt;DebugPack&lt;/strong&gt; that helps us to simplify the bug reporting process for our team and ensures that developers always have the necessary information for successful bug hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bringing automatic detection of backdoors to the CI pipeline</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software backdoors aren’t a myth—they’re a recurring nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;. Time and again, we’ve watched malicious code slip into open-source ecosystems. The notorious xz compromise grabbed headlines, but it wasn’t the first act in this drama. Earlier breaches included the PHP incident in 2021, as well as vulnerabilities in vsFTPd (CVE-2011-2523) and ProFTPD (CVE-2010-20103). And here’s the unsettling truth: these examples likely just scratch the surface. &lt;strong&gt;Why does it matter?&lt;/strong&gt; Because a single backdoor in a widely used project turns into a hacker’s dream buffet—millions of machines served up for exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking down and eliminating backdoors isn’t a quick win&lt;/strong&gt;—it’s like diving headfirst into sprawling code jungles. Sounds epic? In reality, even for a veteran armed with reverse-engineering gear, it’s a grueling slog. So grueling that most people simply don’t bother. The good news? &lt;strong&gt;New tools such as ROSA (&lt;a href="https://github.com/binsec/rosa"&gt;https://github.com/binsec/rosa&lt;/a&gt;) prove that large-scale backdoor detection can be automated&lt;/strong&gt;—at least to a significant extent. Here’s the twist: traditional fuzzers like AFL++ (&lt;a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus"&gt;https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus&lt;/a&gt;) test programs with endless input variations to trigger crashes. It’s brute force, but brilliant for uncovering memory-safety flaws. Backdoors, however, play by different rules—they don’t crash; they lurk behind hidden triggers and perfectly valid behaviors. ROSA changes the game by training fuzzers to tell “normal” execution apart from “backdoored” behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a catch: &lt;strong&gt;ROSA’s current use case is after-the-fact analysis, helping security experts vet full software releases&lt;/strong&gt; (including binaries). Following the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing"&gt;shift-left paradigm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;our goal is to bring this detection magic into the CI pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;—so we can stop backdoors before they ever land. Sounds great, but reality bites: ROSA produces false alarms and can require a significant test budget to find backdoors, which are a nightmare in CI. &lt;strong&gt;In this talk&lt;/strong&gt;, we would like explore the methodological and technical upgrades needed to build a ROSA-based backdoor detection prototype that thrives in CI environments. Think reduced resources, and minimal noise—all within the tight resource windows CI jobs demand.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern automated testing environments generate vast amounts of test results, making failure analysis increasingly complex as both the number of tests and failures grow. This presentation introduces an AI-driven approach to failure aggregation, leveraging text embeddings and semantic similarity to efficiently group and analyze unique failures. The workflow integrates open-source, pre-trained models for text embedding (such as Sentence Transformers) and vector similarity search using PostgreSQL with pgvector, enabling scalable and low-barrier adoption.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, I left my job to build &lt;a href="https://cdviz.dev/"&gt;CDviz&lt;/a&gt; full-time—an open source platform for CI/CD observability using CDEvents, an emerging specification with minimal ecosystem adoption. This talk shares lessons from building production tooling on early-stage standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see:
- Why I chose to build on &lt;a href="https://cdevents.dev"&gt;CDEvents&lt;/a&gt; despite limited adoption
- Technical challenges: converting diverse tool events into a unified format
- Architecture decisions: PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for storage, Grafana for visualization
- Live demo: CDviz tracking deployments with real metrics
- What worked, what didn't, and lessons for building on emerging specs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a builder's story about creating interoperability tooling before the ecosystem is ready—and why standardization matters even when adoption is slow.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing VoIP infrastructure at scale is far from straightforward. These systems route calls and enrich the caller experience, with features such as playing prompts, interactive menus, and caller queues. With so many features and interactions, manually testing every scenario is impossible, so test automation is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software tester for a real-world VoIP infrastructure, I built an automated framework using the open-source SIPSorcery library (https://github.com/sipsorcery-org/sipsorcery) to create programmable softphones that simulate complex call interactions. The talk covers the most interesting challenges faced, such as verifying who can be heard and seen in audio and video calls, mimicking specific physical phones, and making timing-sensitive tests run reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will take away insights into the challenges of large-scale VoIP testing and practical strategies for designing automated tests that are reliable, repeatable, and maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present formal verification, a technique for mathematically verifying code and ensuring it is safe for any possible inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore in particular the theorem prover Rocq, and how we use it to model and verify production code at Formal Land. We show the two primary methods to create a code model, by testing or proving the equivalence with the implementation, and the main classes of properties that are interesting to formally verify on a program.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As security threats become more sophisticated, the need for efficient, real-time communication between identity providers and relying parties is essential. The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and related specifications such as CAEP and RISC address this challenge by providing a standardised way for systems to exchange security related signals, such as session revocations, credential breaches, and other identity-related incidents, in a secure and scalable manner.
This talk introduces the Shared Signals Framework and explains how it enhances security and operational efficiency in modern identity ecosystems. We'll explore how SSF can be supported in Keycloak to enable real-time event-driven communication between providers and relying parties. Attendees will learn how Keycloak can help to detect and mitigate threats, and improve overall system security with SSF.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We introduce the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/scim_client"&gt;SCIM client app&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/"&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt; that allows Nextcloud users and groups to be automatically synced to external services that support the &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/scim/"&gt;SCIM&lt;/a&gt; standard. This enables Nextcloud to act as an authoritative store of user identity information, simplifying user management across multiple connected services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the motivations behind the app as well as its practical use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.proconnect.gouv.fr"&gt;ProConnect&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source Federated Identity Provider written mainly in TypeScript and designed to connect professionals with government services. Developed by the French Interministerial Digital Directorate  (&lt;a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/numerique-etat/dinum/"&gt;DINUM&lt;/a&gt;), it builds on the experience of &lt;a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/"&gt;FranceConnect&lt;/a&gt; while introducing a lightweight, modern architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the story behind ProConnect—from its origins as an open-source fork of FranceConnect to the motivations that guided its redesign. We will provide a high-level overview of its main components (identity management, federation, moderation workflows, administrative tools) and demonstrate how the platform operates in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular focus will be placed on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/proconnect-gouv/federation"&gt;identity broker layer&lt;/a&gt; and its technical foundations, including the use of panva/node-oidc-provider, panva/openid-client, and related tooling. We will look under the hood at how ProConnect implements current practices in identity federation and how its evolving architecture continues to take shape through ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Each month it seems we are made aware of a break in security.   Some report of a data base of identity information that is reported as captured by an entity of some type.  Lists of passwords, ID numbers, bank account information, credit card information.  And these are only the ones we hear about, since many of these break-ins are not reported, or kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we hope that the data is encrypted, but as we all know quantum computers are coming quickly and quantum computers can take present-day encrypted data even with the highest key lengths and break them in minutes which would have taken conventional high performance computers centuries to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another threat comes from the sovereignty of your system and data.  While many cloud companies have put additional servers in various countries (even yours) the companies that generate that software (often closed source) are headquartered in the United States and therefore under US laws like the Patriot Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want a system that is made with Open Source, which allows you to run it on standard equipment that you can inspect, in the country that you want to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system that puts security first. This talk will detail such a system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SUSE’s IAM evolution mirrors its corporate journey, beginning with deep dependency on Novell (later MicroFocus) Access Manager, following its transition to independence.As the organization grew, individual departments adopted several tools to solve immediate authentication needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to a proliferation of unmanageable authentication silos across customer portals, partner networks, and internal employee systems.Recognizing the inefficiencies and risks of this fragmented landscape, SUSE IT has set the goal to consolidate these scattered silos by unifying identities into a single, modern governance solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Passkeys are now first-class citizens on Windows, macOS, Android and iOS - but the Linux desktop still has no standard FIDO2 platform APIs for browsers and native apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents &lt;strong&gt;Credentials for Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/linux-credentials"&gt;github.com/linux-credentials&lt;/a&gt;), a cross-desktop effort to bring Passkeys and other credentials to Linux in a way that works for sandboxed apps and browsers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover:
- &lt;strong&gt;Very short refresher on passkeys &amp;amp; platform authenticators&lt;/strong&gt;: Why WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkeys matter, what platform authenticators are, and how this is solved on Windows Hello, Android and Apple platforms today, and the current state on Linux.&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Architecture of Credentials for Linux&lt;/strong&gt;
  - &lt;a href="https://github.com/linux-credentials/libwebauthn"&gt;&lt;code&gt;libwebauthn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a Rust FIDO2/U2F platform library with support for USB, BLE and Hybrid authenticators (ie. Android &amp;amp; iOS smartphones), designed with pluggable transports and passkey features such as resident keys and user verification.&lt;br /&gt;
  - &lt;a href="https://github.com/linux-credentials/credentialsd"&gt;&lt;code&gt;credentialsd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a D-Bus service and proposed XDG portal for credential management, including a reference UI, Firefox integration (web extension + patched Flatpak build) and distro packages via OBS (Fedora/openSUSE).&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;What this looks like for apps and browsers&lt;/strong&gt;: Demo and design walkthrough of a sandboxed Firefox using &lt;code&gt;credentialsd&lt;/code&gt; to talk to hardware security keys and phones, and how native applications can use the same D-Bus API.&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Roadmap, open problems and call for collaborators&lt;/strong&gt;: TPM-backed platform authenticators, origin binding and unprivileged APIs for browsers, and how we’d like to work with GNOME, KDE, Flatpak, password managers and distributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is aimed at people interested in identity and access management on the desktop: browser and desktop maintainers, distribution engineers, security practitioners and anyone who wants to help make passkeys a first-class citizen of the Linux platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you've ever used Cockpit you might know of the different authentication methods it currently supports. It can be pretty much anything, such as username and password, Kerberos, public keys, single sign-on, or smart cards. But given the nature of Cockpit being a web-based interface we can only support public key authentication through our Flatpak package called Cockpit Client as browsers themselves are sandboxed and can't access your system keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike password authentication when SSHing into a machine but need it for Cockpit access through the browser. Let's see if passkeys can save the day with the help of sssd and FreeIPA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cockpit is a web-based graphical interface for server management of a variety of Linux distributions. Our modifications of the system are made using system APIs and commands with our authentication functioning in the same way with the help of PAM modules.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The world is moving toward more modern and secure authentication methods. This transition is driven by a global push for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), which many organizations are adopting as a security mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, the FreeIPA, SSSD, and GNOME Display Manager (GDM) ecosystems have been working to meet these evolving demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, GDM has received several improvements to enhance the authentication experience. Two new mechanisms have been added: passkeys and external IdP (web login). Users can now choose among the supported authentication mechanisms, and the PAM conversation has been extended to support this new scenario with multiple authentication options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover what the GDM authentication architecture looks like and how it handles PAM conversations. We will discuss the new PAM extension that uses JSON messages to support these mechanisms, the changes made in GDM to allow selecting different authentication methods, upcoming enhancements, and provide a demonstration of the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An ongoing effort to reduce potential attack surface on privileged components of system administration by rewriting them in modern programming languages or introducing new components creates additional problems as well. The system management at scale requires centralization of the access controls, yet most of the new tools do not have such capabilities or don't really concern with such use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'd reflect on our experience of supporting large organizations relying on the infrastructure provided by FreeIPA and SSSD.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SSH is the default access method for Linux servers, typically configured with passwords or public/private key authentication. However, in large multi-user deployments, these methods have significant drawbacks: security of private keys on unmanaged clients, key management on the server side, and the difficulty of integrating multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative methods exist but are not always easy to implement. In this talk, I compare two of the most promising approaches—OpenSSH certificates and OpenPubKey (OPKSSH)—based on a recent evaluation for a multi-user compute cluster with dozens of machines and hundreds of unmanaged clients. I discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach, including client configuration, required additional software, and operational complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation includes live demos illustrating how each method works from both the client and server perspective, and a closer look at the inner workings of SSH certificates and OPKSSH.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a crucial but often misunderstood component of modern Linux systems. This talk provides a comprehensive introduction to PAM, explaining how it enables system administrators to configure authentication, account management, session setup, and password policies without recompiling applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin by exploring the problems PAM was designed to solve—hardcoded authentication logic, inflexibility, and inconsistent security policies across applications. The talk then covers PAM's four management groups: authentication (verifying identity), account management (checking access restrictions), session management (setting up user sessions), and password management (enforcing password policies and token changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn how to read and write PAM configuration files, understand the behavior of different control values (required, requisite, sufficient, optional), and leverage advanced control syntax for complex authentication flows. Special attention is given to the "frozen stack" concept—a frequently misunderstood behavior where PAM fixes the module sequence during the first API call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through real-world examples and practical configuration insights, attendees will learn how to troubleshoot PAM issues and understand the impact of PAM configuration changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond understanding current PAM functionality, the talk explores the future of PAM: potential enhancements to address modern authentication needs, architectural improvements and the challenges that stand in the way of evolution. We'll discuss compatibility constraints, the need for backward compatibility with existing deployments, and the tensions between maintaining a stable API and introducing new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is suitable for system administrators, security engineers, and developers who want to understand and effectively configure PAM-based authentication on Linux systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;bind-dyndb-ldap is a dynamic database plugin that allows the BIND DNS server to store and retrieve all DNS zone and record data directly from an LDAP directory server. This deep integration is essential for centralized identity management solutions, particularly in FreeIPA setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve its function, bind-dyndb-ldap must utilize BIND's internal, lower-level APIs. When a recent major BIND release introduced significant breaking changes, what began as a simple compilation bug because of a missing header quickly escalated into a massive technical challenge. The core problem: adapting years of legacy code to the new BIND server architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the challenges of planning the redesign, how we faced the technical challenges when adapting old code to modern APIs and the lessons learned through the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In modern identity-centric infrastructures, DNS is a critical—but often overlooked—component of a Zero-Trust Architecture. This talk, positioned within the IAM devroom's core infrastructure and security track, explores how environments that rely on FreeIPA as their authoritative DNS can adopt encrypted DNS end-to-end without sacrificing performance or operational clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the results of our work integrating encrypted DNS across Fedora systems and Kubernetes clusters while seamlessly interacting with FreeIPA's BIND-based DNS service. Throughout this process, we identified key integration challenges, their practical resolutions, and the tangible security benefits gained from encrypting internal DNS traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To validate the feasibility of this approach at scale, we performed extensive workload and performance tests—covering multiple orders of 1,000+ DNS requests per second—comparing encrypted vs. non-encrypted scenarios. These tests demonstrate how to achieve stronger security guarantees without imposing unacceptable latency or throughput penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this effort, we extended FreeIPA's DNS service with Prometheus-ready metrics, enabling real-time visibility into encrypted DNS performance, request patterns, and system-level statistics. These observability enhancements provide operators with the data required to meet and maintain Zero-Trust mandates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk, attendees will understand not only how to deploy encrypted DNS in hybrid Fedora and Kubernetes environments, but also how to measure, validate, and operationalize it in a way that fully aligns with Zero-Trust principles.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building FreeIPA’s modern WebUI meant leaving Dojo behind for React, but we couldn't leave our robust authentication capabilities behind. We needed to bring password, OTP, Kerberos, and certificate support into the new era. This raised a fundamental question: how do we translate these complex legacy flows into clean, modern code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to explore this adaptation journey with us. We’ll discuss shifting from scattered widget logic to unified Redux state management and declarative components, while reimagining our API layer. This process didn't just replicate old features—it evolved them, delivering a more secure and optimized codebase through the power of strict type safety.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The OpenFlexure Microscope is an open source, laboratory-grade robotic microscope, used by a diverse community including academic researchers, engineers, educators, pathologists and hobbyists (https://openflexure.org/, https://openflexure.discourse.group/). Users from over 60 countries have developed and used the device for everything ranging from exploring their garden's wildlife, to training medical students to diagnose cancer. Joe presents his experience as an academic member of the OpenFlexure development team for the last eight years. While his work focuses on the medical applications of the Microscope, research is planned and prioritised to benefit all members of the community. Development of the OpenFlexure software has enabled smart microscopy on the OpenFlexure Microscope, with automated sample identification, smart path planning and image processing, bringing novel research techniques such as digital pathology into new environments which traditionally lack the infrastructure to support them (https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope-server, https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope). The research builds on FOSS software and libraries, including Arduino and OpenCV, and extends open science by improving access to essential hardware. This is reflected in the range of OpenFlexure publications from outside the core development team, including peer reviewed articles in the fields of engineering, machine learning, medicine and social science.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Community Curation of Natural Science Collections with DiSSCo</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At the current rate of digitization, it is estimated that it would take hundreds of years to fully digitize the natural science collections of Europe. In the face of the biodiversity crisis, we urgently need to scale up digitization to equip researchers with the tools to tackle this challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Distributed System of Scientific Collections, DiSSCo, is a fully open source European infrastructure that is bringing together over 300 institutions into a unified, digital natural science collection. DiSSCo harmonizes data into one data model and enables sharing human expertise and machine services across institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through annotating specimen records on the platform, experts from around the world can contribute to curation and enhancement of data. Most crucially, taxonomists, whose expertise is highly specialized and sought after, can easily share their knowledge and improve specimen data across institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging a shared data model, machine agents can further improve and enhance specimen data, through linking to other infrastructures, georeferencing, and even label transcription. Instead of being confined to a single institution, services adapted for DiSSCo can be applied to any specimen in Europe, breaking institutional silos and furthering collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts culminate in a digital extended specimen, which acts as a “digital twin” to the physical object, with links to publications, genetic sequences, and other related information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation gives an overview of the progress of the DiSSCo infrastructure, collaboration with researchers and collection managers, and the future of DiSSCo’s development. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Colandr 2.0: reflections on a near-decade of free and open evidence synthesis tooling development, management, and use</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The exponential growth of scientific literature—doubling roughly every nine years—has made it increasingly difficult for researchers and decision-makers to locate, assess, and synthesize the evidence needed for sound policy and practice. Systematic maps and systematic reviews offer robust, unbiased ways to answer “what works?” but today they depend on manual search and screening workflows that are slow, costly, and vulnerable to human error. The result is a bottleneck: high-quality, up-to-date evidence syntheses are often too labor-intensive to produce at the pace conservation challenges demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk and demo presents an open, community-driven approach to lowering that bottleneck using human-in-the-loop machine learning and transparent evidence-management tooling. In 2018, DataKind and the the Science for Nature and People Partnership, built two free and open-access, web-based workflows for computer-assisted paper screening and evidence management, integrated into a single collaborative application (colandrapp.com). The platform combines active-learning prioritization, reproducible labeling, and interactive visualization to help teams rapidly identify relevant studies from tens of thousands of documents, extract key metadata, and generate portable, shareable review outputs. All components are designed to support open research practices: auditable decision trails, exportable datasets, and interoperability with downstream synthesis and visualization tools. Now, in 2026, we are releasing a significant update to Colandr that ensures the tool continues to be functional and sustainable.  Colandr is supported by a global community of researchers and volunteers (colandrcommunity.com) and this session will highlight the additional open source solutions that have been built on top of the Colandr stack in addition to the Colandr product updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to engage the FOSDEM community around a concrete open research challenge: building trustworthy, extensible tools that keep evidence synthesis fast, reproducible, and accessible. Participants will leave with a clear view of the platform’s capabilities, the design decisions behind it, and a set of well-scoped technical and research directions where open-source contributors can meaningfully push the state of practice forward.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AI has become an integral part of modern research, offering tremendous opportunities, but also raising important questions for the Open Science community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the emergence of the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) and its emphasis on the four freedoms, the “freedom to study” stands out as a cornerstone for achieving true reproducibility. You can read the OSAID definition here: https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how researchers can design, implement, and sustain reproducible AI practices within their work, especially in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where infrastructure and culture around reproducibility are still developing. Drawing from practical examples and community experiences, I’ll outline actionable steps for embedding openness and reproducibility in AI workflows. These approaches are adaptable across contexts and can help build a more transparent, collaborative, and trustworthy global AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My perspective is shaped by my work as an Open Source Manager and Project Coordinator with Data Science Without Borders, and as a contributor to The Turing Way, where I advocate for open, inclusive, and reproducible research practices in data science and AI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;vLLM (https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) has rapidly become a community-standard open-source engine for LLM inference, backed by a large and growing contributor base and widely adopted for production serving. This talk offers a practical blueprint for scaling inference in vLLM using two complementary techniques, quantization (https://github.com/vllm-project/llm-compressor) and speculative decoding (https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators). Drawing on extensive evaluations across language and vision-language models, we examine the real accuracy–performance trade-offs of each method and, crucially, how they interact in end-to-end deployments. We highlight configurations that substantially cut memory footprint while preserving model quality, and show when these speedups translate best to low-latency versus high-throughput serving. Attendees will leave with data-backed guidance, deployment-ready settings, and a clear roadmap for leveraging quantization and speculative decoding to accelerate vLLM inference in real-world pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing creates new opportunities, but building and operating a quantum cloud service remains a complex challenge, often relying on proprietary, black-box solutions. To bridge this gap, we introduce OQTOPUS (Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers) [1], a comprehensive open-source software stack designed to build and manage full-scale quantum computing systems.
OQTOPUS provides a complete cloud architecture for quantum computers, covering three critical layers:
1.Frontend Layer: Web-based interfaces and SDKs that allow users to easily design and submit quantum circuits.
2.Cloud Layer: A scalable management system for users, jobs, and devices, designed to be deployable on public clouds (see oqtopus-cloud [2]).
3.Backend Layer: The core execution engine that handles circuit transcoding, error mitigation, and low-level device control, utilizing modular tools such as OQTOPUS Engine [3] and Tranqu [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed in collaboration with The University of Osaka, Fujitsu Limited, Systems Engineering Consultants Co., LTD. (SEC), and TIS Inc. (TIS) is already powering operational superconducting quantum computers. This talk will detail the modular architecture of OQTOPUS, demonstrating how developers and researchers can use it to construct their own quantum cloud platforms, customize compilation strategies, and experiment with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Join us to learn how OQTOPUS is democratizing access to the deepest layers of quantum infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NoiseModelling is an open-source platform for simulating environmental noise propagation and generating regulatory-compliant noise maps at urban and regional scales. Leaded since 2008 by the Joint Research Unit in Environmental Acoustics at Gustave Eiffel University, it provides researchers and practitioners with reproducible, transparent, and scalable modelling capabilities for environmental acoustics. As the modelling core of the Noise-Planet framework, NoiseModelling simulates noise propagation from road traffic, railways, and industrial sources using the standardized CNOSSOS-EU method for emission and propagation. It operates as a Java library or through a user-friendly web interface, tightly integrated with spatial databases H2GIS or PostGIS to handle large-scale urban datasets efficiently. The broader Noise-Planet ecosystem complements NoiseModelling's simulation capabilities with participatory noise measurement through the NoiseCapture mobile application. After more than three years of operation, the platform has collected data from over 100,000 downloads and 74,000 contributors worldwide, enabling citizens and researchers to create high-resolution, crowdsourced noise maps that respect privacy while contributing to scientific research. This integrated approach bridges computational modeling with real-world measurements, promoting open science principles through open-source code, open data, and collaborative research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RELab: An Open Infrastructure for Collaborative Product Data Collection in the Circular Economy</title>

        <abstract>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular Economy research is stalled by a simple problem: we don't have open data on what products are actually made of. Manufacturers keep Bill of Materials (BOM) proprietary, and existing databases are expensive silos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces RELab, an open-source (AGPLv3) infrastructure designed to reverse-engineer this data through community crowdsourcing. We will dive into the technical architecture—a FastAPI/SQLModel backend and Expo/React Native mobile app—and discuss the challenges of implementing FAIR data principles in a "wild" contribution environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To model material flows effectively, researchers need granular data on product weights, materials, and disassembly steps. Currently, this data is either locked in PDFs or proprietary databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RELab (Reverse Engineering Lab) is an attempt to build a protoype of a "Wikipedia for Products." It allows researchers and citizens to disassemble products, digitize them, and contribute to an open data commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk, I will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Architecture: How we built a scalable API using FastAPI, Pydantic, and PostgreSQL to handle complex, nested product data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Client: A cross-platform mobile app (built with Expo) that enables "in-the-field" data collection at recycling centers and repair cafes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hardware: A quick look at our Raspberry Pi integration for standardized, reproducible product photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Challenge: How to build a system that is technically interoperable with rigid industrial ecology tools (like openLCA or Brightway) while remaining accessible and engaging for non-technical citizen scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for feedback on our strategy to gamify data collection and engage a broader community of contributors outside of academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submission License&lt;/em&gt;: AGPLv3 (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt;: Simon van Lierde&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;: s.n.van.lierde@cml.leidenuniv.nl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biography&lt;/em&gt;: Simon van Lierde is a PhD candidate and research software engineer at Leiden University (CML). He maintains RELab, an AGPLv3 platform for crowdsourcing product composition data. His work focuses on building open infrastructure for the Circular Economy using modern stacks (FastAPI, React Native) and bridging the gap between industrial ecology and the open-source community.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openparldata.ch"&gt;OpenParlData.ch&lt;/a&gt; provides free access to harmonized data from Swiss parliaments. We currently offer data on political actors, parliamentary proceedings, decrees, consultations, votes, and more from &lt;a href="https://admin.openparldata.ch/#/bodies"&gt;74&lt;/a&gt; parliaments. Researchers (e.g. political scientists, linguists) but also journalists and civil society organizations can use our &lt;a href="https://api.openparldata.ch/documentation"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; to create their own analyses, visualisations, and tools, thereby promoting transparency, participation, and innovation in Swiss politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://admin.openparldata.ch/#/pipeline?tab=details"&gt;import&lt;/a&gt; data (mostly from websites and some APIs), clean, harmonize and publish them openly. The data infrastructure is &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/opendata.ch/openparldatach/data-infrastructure"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and currently in beta. In addition to the API, we are developing &lt;a href="https://openparldata.ch/about/standard"&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; that enable parliaments and governments to publish uniform open data. Over the next year, we will address the question of how we can efficiently and financially sustainably operate a data infrastructure that continues to provide crucial data openly in three years' time and how we can enable other actors to publish interoperable high-quality data. We look forward to sharing what we have learnt and hearing your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/medialab/xan"&gt;Xan&lt;/a&gt; is a command-line tool designed to manipulate CSV files directly from the comfort of the terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally developed within a sociology research lab to perform common operations on very large datasets collected from the web (exploration, sorting, computing frequency tables, joins, aggregations, etc.), it has become a go-to solution for its users for many more use-cases, including lexicometry analysis, plotting histograms, time series or heatmaps, and even generating network graphs. And while the tool was initially created to deal with very large CSV files, it is now also used by people to process small files, and other file formats. The tool was thus included in the daily data manipulation practices of its users, who saw it as an opportunity to never leave their shells, without having to rely on GUIs or notebooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation, given by a research engineer after two years of regular use, examines the reasons for this appropriation, which relates both to the constraints of research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and to the interface design choices that make xan effective.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Skills of a FLOSS Developer and Why They Are Important in Open Research</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open research requires skills that Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) developers have been cultivating for decades and that have made them successful in building their communities and business models. Discussing in public, creating inclusive communities, developing governance models suitable for community-driven projects, securing funding are all skills FLOSS developers require to sustain their software projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These skills are equally needed in open research, when it is not merely understood as open access, but it is conceived as an effort to create communities of practice that overcome geographical, disciplinary, and social boundaries. Developing these skills in open research, however, is still work in progress. For instance, peer review, which is a mainstay of research, usually continues to take place behind closed doors and involves a limited number of actors rather than the entire community with risks of fraud and knowledge gatekeeping. Similarly, open research networks struggle to be as inclusive as FLOSS projects. Participation is traditionally determined by institutional affiliations and funding, and citizen science contributions are often neglected because they do not fit into the scheme of traditional scholarly knowledge. Robust governance models and long-term funding strategies are also lacking in open research in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is a personal reflection based on my experience working in research data management and engaging in my free time with open-source projects and volunteer-based initiatives to promote coding literacy. At times when AI-generated code is marketed as the only possible future of software, including research software, my reflection focuses instead on the human skills and shared values underpinning software development in FLOSS communities, why I consider them a precious asset, and why I hope they will continue to exist and fully transfer into open research.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2012, a small group looking at challenges related to the development and maintenance of research software realized that there was no community identity (e.g., common title, career path, professional association) for the people involved, so they started a process to define and create these. Today, 13+ years later, there are research software engineer (RSE) and engineering (RSEng) groups at more than 100 universities, and &lt;a href="https://researchsoftware.org/assoc.html"&gt;RSE societies and associations&lt;/a&gt; in more than 10 countries (e.g., &lt;a href="https://society-rse.org"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://us-rse.org"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://de-rse.org"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://be-rse.org/"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;), with over 10000 members and annual physical and virtual conferences, including a &lt;a href="https://www.researchsoft.org/irsc/"&gt;first global research software conference&lt;/a&gt; coming in 2026. This talk will briefly discuss the movement that created this, then will focus on the experience of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where there is now a group of 45 RSEs in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and many more across the university. &lt;a href="https://ncsa.illinois.edu/resources-and-services/software-applications/"&gt;RSEs at NCSA&lt;/a&gt; bring skills and expertise including full-stack development, UI/UX design, GIS, AI, MLOps, DevOps, and data science and engineering with projects such as &lt;a href="https://clowderframework.org/"&gt;Clowder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tools.in-core.org/"&gt;IN-CORE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://chat.illinois.edu/"&gt;Illinois Chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earthcube.org/decoder"&gt;DeCODER&lt;/a&gt;, etc., across multiple scholarly and industrial domains. Beyond technical advancement, the group has been developing and enhancing mentoring RSEs and RSE managers. The talk will discuss how this group was developed, the challenges it overcame, and the challenges that remain.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Trusted by design: how to set up your research software for community adoption</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;So, you want to create an open-source research software package — and not just for yourself or your group. You’d like people around the world to use it, and even contribute to it. How do you persuade them it’s worth their time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source projects rise and fall on trust. You may hope to build trust on technical merits: your algorithm is novel; your implementation fast; your tests thorough. All great, but not enough. Many technically excellent projects never break through because they neglect the social foundations of trust, which are laid long before a project matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that's good news:&lt;/strong&gt; you don’t need to be a top-tier programmer to build a successful open-source tool. Normal researchers do this all the time. What matters most is how you run the project, not how fancy the code is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk distils lessons from years of building and maintaining scientific Python tools used by researchers worldwide. I’ll outline the practices that signal reliability and sustainability across a project’s lifecycle: defining and communicating your mission from the start; making a reasonable first release and following it up with consistency; and using open communication channels to embody your values and model healthy norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the talk, I’ll draw on examples from &lt;a href="https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; — a Python package I develop — and other tools built by the &lt;a href="https://neuroinformatics.dev/"&gt;Research Software Engineering team&lt;/a&gt; I’m part of. That said, the lessons should be applicable to any free open-source project that aspires to attract and sustain a healthy community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; If you behave like a trustworthy project from the beginning, people will treat you like one, and help the project grow into what it promises to be.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Introducing Jupyter Book 2: Next-generation Tools for Creating Computational Narratives</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Book is a core tool for sharing computational science, powering more than 14,000 open, online textbooks, knowledge bases, lectures, courses and community sites. It allows researchers and educators to create books and knowledge bases that are reusable, reproducible, and interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, we have rebuilt Jupyter Book from the ground up, focused on allowing authors to produce machine readable, semantically structured content that can be flexibly deployed, reused, and cross referenced in unprecedented ways. We achieved this by adopting, stewarding, and developing the MyST Markdown Document Engine (mystmd.org), a more flexible and extensible engine that integrates with Jupyter for interactive computation. Jupyter Book 2 represents a major leap forward in how we share and distribute computational content on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we cover the key ideas driving Jupyter Book 2 and MyST, and showcase real-world examples like The Turing Way, and Project Pythia. We'll demonstrate major new functionality with live demos, and give the audience practical tips for getting started with the new Jupyter Book 2 stack.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A presentation of a new tool that allows visualising groups of Wikipedia articles, analysing and monitoring them, supporting the work of volunteers, researchers, and institutions, and creating knowledge landscapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype focuses on Wikipedia articles related to climate change and sustainability, aiming to assess current coverage of these topics and test interventions. However, the tool developed can be applied to any topic, starting from Wikidata and Wikipedia categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This free and open software tool is developed in the framework of the international research project “Visual Analytics for Sustainability and Climate Change: Assessing online open content and supporting community engagement. The case of Wikipedia" (2025-2029), led by the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), in collaboration with Wiki Education Foundation, Wikimedistas de Uruguay, Wiki in Africa and Open Climate Campaign, with the endorsement of Wikimedia Italia, the support of the SNSF (10.003.183) and the engagement of many Wikipedia and Wikidata volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is an invitation to contribute to the design of the tool and its tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research project: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Visualizing_sustainability_and_climate_change_on_Wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-design of the tool: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Visual_Analytics_for_Sustainability_and_Climate_Change/Tool/Co-design_activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototype https://giovannipro.github.io/wikipedia-climate-change/?lang=en&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The visualisations will be integrated into the dashboard Visualizing Impact by Wiki Education.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How to work with toxic data?  In our project we work with DNS query streams, which contain a lot of data that may expose single users and their browsing behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers how we have built a large scale statistics platform while preserving the user’s privacy and still being able to find important observations. We cover which algorithms and methods we use to gather the data in a cloud platform and run advanced analytics without touching individual user data. We share how to go from big data sets to small aggregated and minimised sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the approach of "small data" is applicable to any field where you want to use and share sensitive data. We also invite the audience to audit our work and help build a privacy-first internet statistics platform as one good example.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gambit-project.org/"&gt;“Gambit”&lt;/a&gt; project for computation in game theory has been through multiple phases of development, dating back to the 1980s. Game theory as a field &amp;amp; methodology emerged from economics, but increasingly has applications in cybersecurity, multi-agent systems research and AI. Gambit is used across these fields for both teaching purposes, and as a suite of software tools for scientific computing. Recent Gambit development has been carried out at The Alan Turing Institute and has involved a modernisation of the PyGambit Python API, with a particular focus on improving the user experience, including clear user tutorials and documentation. This in turn has helped to guide the prioritisation of features in recent package releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce some fundamental concepts in game theory using PyGambit, explaining how the package can be used to create and visualise non-cooperative games, and compute their Nash equilibria (where game players have no incentive to deviate their strategies). The talk will also highlight how PyGambit fits into the broader open-source scientific computing ecosystem for research on games via interoperability with the OpenSpiel framework, which is used for reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Draupnir is a unified platform to grow, manage, and sustain communities on Matrix. Over the last 3 years we have learned many lessons to share with the community on building trust and safety tooling in an open federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss just a few of the many problems we have faced, and our experience solving them  &lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Policy servers (&lt;a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4284"&gt;MSC4284&lt;/a&gt;) are a new tool available to communities on Matrix to help reduce spam and other unwelcome content, but they aren't the only option. Communities have a whole suite of tools available to them to keep their users safe, such as moderation bots and in-client safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll cover the layers of Trust &amp;amp; Safety (T&amp;amp;S) tooling available to communities, how they work, and what harms they are typically best at mitigating. We'll also demonstrate how to set up a policy server in your community, and discuss what they might be able to do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As protocols and platforms grow, so do the demands of policy enforcement, human review workflows, and cross-platform incident response. Trust and safety tools form this critical layer of Internet infrastructure, yet most solutions remain closed, proprietary, and reinvented in isolation. Further, they’re typically out of reach for smaller and decentralized platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://roost.tools"&gt;Robust Open Online Safety Tools (ROOST)&lt;/a&gt; is building a different future: one where these trust and safety tools are open, transparent, community-governed, and usable by platforms and organizations of all sizes. In this talk, you’ll get a refresher on what “trust and safety” means; hear how ROOST is succeeding with a non-profit and open source approach; learn about the newly-released &lt;a href="https://github.com/roostorg/osprey"&gt;Osprey&lt;/a&gt; rules engine and investigation tool—already in production across platforms like &lt;a href="https://bsky.social"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://discord.com"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;; see a demo of Osprey in action; and finally, learn how to adopt and contribute to Osprey and other open source trust and safety tools with ROOST.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An overview of all that's been happening with the Matrix protocol in the last year, including:
 * Project Hydra (state resolution improvements)
 * Trust &amp;amp; Safety improvements
 * Matrix 2.0 MSCs (OIDC, Simplified Sliding Sync, Matrix RTC and Invisible Crypto)
 * P2P Matrix progress
 * Encryption advances with MLS, post quantum
 * Updates on the scores of public sector Matrix deployments we're seeing emerge as countries seek digital sovereignty...
...and more!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/element-hq/element-web"&gt;Element Web&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest and most widely deployed Matrix client, and could well be the most widely deployed decentralised comms client in active service, especially when considering its many forks (Tchap, openDesk Chat, BundesMessenger, SchildiChat, LuxChat, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 11 years it has accumulated a very significant amount of technical debt, and we believe that one of the main ways to accelerate the uptake of decentralised communication would be to be radically improve the codebase.  This means &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; doing a rewrite, and instead figuring out how to carefully switch the engine mid-flight from matrix-js-sdk to matrix-rust-sdk running in WASM, ensuring Element Web benefits from all the improvements which have landed in the Element X mobile apps, while simultaneously stopping reinventing the wheel between the two stacks.  We'll demonstrate experiments with &lt;a href="https://github.com/element-hq/aurora"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; as our playground for running Element Web's react components on top of matrix-rust-sdk, and explain how we hope to bring decentralised comms to a wider audience by making Element Web as performant and snappy as Element X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk should be of extreme interest to anyone who has ever complained about Element Web being slow or RAM hungry, and who wants to see a world where decentralised comms can outrun the centralised alternatives!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Discover how MatrixRTC transforms into a "backendless" multiplayer game server and join us for a live Godot game session inside a Matrix widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VOIP team at Element will present their progress on abstracting an RTC SDK from the Element Call stack. We want to share the current state as we try to use it to build a multi-player game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Godot, you will learn how to potentially use Matrix as a free, encrypted backend that handles account creation and persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, there will be a gaming session with the devroom! Prepare to battle!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Element is the most widely deployed Matrix client, built by the team who created Matrix in order to bootstrap the ecosystem.  The last few years have been quite a rollercoaster in terms of figuring out how to ensure Element can contribute to Matrix sustainably long-term - a problem faced by many open source projects whose core team works on the project as their day job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is we think we've now found a sustainable model that works, having moved from Apache to AGPL and having finally released an official Matrix distribution from Element in the form of &lt;a href="https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm"&gt;Element Server Suite (ESS) Community&lt;/a&gt; under the AGPL.  In this talk we'll give a super quick tour of the journey that we've been on and the learnings encountered along the way, in the hope that other decentralised comms projects can learn from our mistakes and successes.  We'll look at the work Element's been doing to sustainably progress Matrix - be that driving forwards Matrix 2.0 spec work, maintaining Synapse, or ensuring that matrix-rust-sdk provides a foundational client SDK suitable for Element X, Fractal, iamb and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll take a quick look at how Element has ended up bringing decentralised communication to the heart of public sector open source collaboration suites such as Germany's &lt;a href="https://www.opendesk.eu/en"&gt;openDesk&lt;/a&gt; from ZenDiS, France's &lt;a href="https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/en"&gt;La Suite&lt;/a&gt; from DINUM, and The Netherlands' &lt;a href="https://github.com/MinBZK/mijn-bureau-infra"&gt;MijnBureau&lt;/a&gt; from MinBZK - and take a look at what the future may bring!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is an IETF standard (RFC9420) for end-to-end encryption in messaging systems.  However, it requires a delivery service that determines an ordering of handshake messages, which does not fit with certain messaging architectures.  In this talk, we will explore some of the work that has been done to make MLS work in a distributed/decentralized environment, and look at some of the remaining issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Engineering XMPP Federation: Building Messaging, Voice &amp; Social Features Across Independent Projects</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building open federated communication systems requires more than publishing specifications. It demands a living ecosystem of independent implementations that actually work together. The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is a standards body, but is also the center of a development ecosystem that encompasses 5+ major servers and 20+ clients, all developed by different individuals and organizations, all highly interoperable and shipping new features at an accelerating pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will share how all this can work at this scale and will be co-presented by a server developer and a client developer, showing how they work together to fine-tune their implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will first explain how the XSF works on its specifications, how its process has improved over the years, with proven engineering patterns that enable independent projects to build interoperable features without tight coupling (and without central coordination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will illustrate the talk by showing real-life collaboration examples that came to life in 2025, sharing the points of view of an ejabberd server developer and the Movim client developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a conclusion, we will tease new features currently in design for 2026 and give you a glimpse at messaging federation, the XMPP way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people who are interested in contributing to a truly decentralized protocol design initiative or who would like to understand what they can expect from XMPP in the future, based on examples of what has been achieved in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What if you could have chat, video conferencing, blogging, and social communities all in one place without giving up your data to a centralized platform? Movim is a web-based application that brings the full power of XMPP to end users, combining instant messaging, group chats, video calls, and a complete publishing platform into a unified experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll present how Movim leverages the XMPP standard and its extensions (Pubsub, MUC, Jingle) to deliver features users expect from modern social platforms while remaining fully federated, interoperable with other XMPP clients like Conversations and Dino, and capable of bridging to centralized platforms like Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll discuss the technical challenges of building a rich web frontend on top of XMPP, showcase the exciting features recently added to the project, and introduce the upcoming planned ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're an XMPP enthusiast or curious about decentralized alternatives to mainstream social media, come discover how Movim is bridging the gap between protocol power and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the "Now Playing" feature in MSN Messenger? It was a feature that make you able to see which song are your friends listening at the moment back in 2000s, but unfortunately it is mostly forgotten now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share the journey on my research on implementing this feature in modern XMPP clients, the protocols of certain operating systems to read the currently playing media, the current status of the support of XEP-0118[^1] and the PoC of a modern "Now Playing" feature.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bonfire: Modular Communication Tools on the Open Social Web</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bonfire is a next-generation, open-source platform for building trustful communities and federated networks. It reimagines social communication by allowing communities to enable, disable, or adapt features and even protocols, putting community governance, and autonomy combined with consentful interconnection at its core. Bonfire federates with ActivityPub, with bridging available to ATproto (and hopefully more to come). Bonfire’s federated groups, thread-centric discussions, and modular architecture make it easy to experiment with new forms of moderation, identity, and trust that reach beyond single servers, single platforms, or single protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ongoing work and demo of fully &lt;strong&gt;end-to-end encrypted messaging&lt;/strong&gt; (MLS-based) over ActivityPub, one the first two implementations of its kind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ActivityPub C2S API use: &lt;strong&gt;how apps can easily integrate with the fediverse&lt;/strong&gt; (including MLS messaging) via Bonfire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interoperability: &lt;strong&gt;extending ActivityPub&lt;/strong&gt; for advanced user stories, moderation, as well as &lt;strong&gt;bridging&lt;/strong&gt; with ATproto and potential future integrations with Matrix, XMPP, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consentful communication flows and privacy-preserving tools for &lt;strong&gt;trust and safety&lt;/strong&gt; (such as circles and boundaries)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonfire’s &lt;strong&gt;modular architecture&lt;/strong&gt;: designing “app flavours” with custom governance, moderation, and communication tools for different community needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will see a live demo and leave with ideas and tools for composing their own modular, federated, and privacy-focused social communication spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;DASL (Data-Addressed Structures &amp;amp; Links, https://dasl.ing/) is a suite of small and simple specs that provide a proven, reliable, interoperable toolbox for content-addressing that can be used in other protocols. It has quality implementations in multiple languages, has multiple components used by the AT Protocol, and has some parts also documented in an IETF draft. For the most part, it is a subset of IPFS ruthlessly aimed at interoperability and ease of use. This talk offers a tour and introduction to the core concepts, and provides pointers for reuse in other protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Decentralized Key Management / Self Sovereign Identity holds the promise of a truly decentralized, self-verifying PKI. Approaches like KERI, the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure, balance privacy, verifiability, and the protection from duplicity. But their promises have remained largely academic thus far. In 2026, the Swiss Healthcare System will be the first large-scale deployment of this kind of infrastructure, using it to upgrade the trust, security and privacy levels of its aging email infrastructure. The result will be a production ready technology stack that can be utilised for a large number of use cases around communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georg Greve is centrally involved in that transition, and will share the road travelled so far, the current state, and the next steps for this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AT: The Billion-Edge Open Social Graph</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Social graphs are a well-understood technology. Using infrastructure and standardized protocols that are usually de facto controlled by large, commercial platforms, they provide a way of structuring and querying data about individual nodes (often users) in a network and the relationships (edges) between these nodes. They are theoretically extensible, and social graph data can typically also be represented using open standards like RDF which can be published and consumed by other authorities participating in a network. However, trying to enable participation or federation this way is frequently wishful thinking, and does not really facilitate scaling that social graph beyond a particular API representation of rows in one organization’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://atproto.com/"&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; — built on AT — presents a different approach. When you write data using Atmosphere APIs, such as by &lt;a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/tutorials/creating-a-post"&gt;posting to Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, that data is associated with your personal &lt;a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos"&gt;data repository&lt;/a&gt;. These personal data repositories can be hosted or migrated anywhere across the Atmosphere. Each Atmosphere app declares its own schema (&lt;a href="https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;), and reads and writes its own set of fields. These fields can be read by &lt;a href="https://anisota.net/feed"&gt;any other app built on the Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to both a) own and b) span their graphs across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enables several in-demand use cases. Building &lt;a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture"&gt;“big world”&lt;/a&gt; social apps with AT is only a matter of creating new lexicons to support additional data models, designing app views which serve this data (along with any other data that may already be available to a user’s graph from other AT apps), and &lt;a href="https://atproto.com/guides/self-hosting"&gt;self-hosting&lt;/a&gt; the necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide &lt;a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/"&gt;implementation patterns&lt;/a&gt;, along with primitives and tools that are of interest to almost all implementers — like OAuth Scopes and moderation tools. We also provide a social networking app (&lt;a href="http://bsky.social/"&gt;Bluesky Social&lt;/a&gt;) that serves as both a reference implementation for the protocol, and a critical-mass opportunity to populate users’ social graphs so that other application developers can benefit from shared data. Regardless of which application is using this data, all of it is open, public, and associated with individual users’ data repositories, which can be migrated across the network at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a demonstration of some fundamental AT technologies, including:
"Sipping the Firehose" - working with the stream, a demo of creating records and have them pop right out
“Getting backlinks with Constellation” - querying social interactions in real time, and building that data into different interfaces
“Lexicon Authoring” - a discussion of best practices for creating additional schemas, with examples from other apps in the Atmosphere&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I had a few talks at conferences, entitled "Disobay: FOSS tools to fight back," where I explained what tools exist for us to protect our communication and why we should use them. I covered several decentralized tools and protocols, and then I asked, "Are there any questions?"  One person asked, "How do I convince my friends to move to those tools"? And the audience nodded in agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took this topic seriously. With this talk, I aim to cover the subject of their adoption - we all build great tools, but what approaches can we use to encourage people to join the right side? The majority of the cases I would showcase are from real people on my fediverse, Hacker News, and other networks I'm a part of.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>BLog: High-Performance Per-Component Binary Logging</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When a kernel component like a storage driver misbehaves in production, developers face a difficult choice. They either have too little information to solve the bug or they enable slow console-level debug logs that ruin performance. This talk introduces a per-component binary logging mechanism designed to support verbose logging in production with negligible run-time cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We achieve this efficiency by moving the heavy lifting to build time. using preprocessor macros, we emit parameter serialization stubs and save location-specific formats in a separate side table. At run time, the hot path only records a location ID, a timestamp, and the raw parameters. No format expansion occurs until the logs are read. We support high concurrency using a mostly lock-free multi-level allocator that allows dozens of CPUs to write simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduce a significant architectural change by adding a single TLS pointer to &lt;code&gt;struct task_struct&lt;/code&gt;. This tags each thread with a private logging buffer. If a thread stalls or deadlocks, the tag remains attached to the buffer. This allows post-mortem analysis to reveal the exact context-specific history of that thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;ftrace_printk&lt;/code&gt; which dumps everything into a single global ring, our logger maintains one ring per component context. This allows you to capture exactly the data you need for a specific file system or operation. The memory footprint is minimal. Each record is only eight bytes. This saves 16 bytes per entry compared to the standard &lt;code&gt;bprint_entry&lt;/code&gt;. This efficiency reduces memory accesses and facilitates a truly production-ready binary logging infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can finally keep verbose logging active at all times. This ensures that when a crash or deadlock occurs, the high-fidelity history needed to solve it is already waiting in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For years, Ahmad’s ideal has been simple: unpack a rootfs on a server, mount it over NFS (or usb9pfs), boot directly into it, and everything just works™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as secure boot becomes the default on many embedded systems, squeezing in a network-booted kernel is getting harder and often falls outside the supported boot flow entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, some recent improvements in the kernel build system pave the way for a far less invasive netboot setup. This talk gives a quick tour of the key pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image.fit target for arm64 introduced in v6.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modules-cpio-pkg target introduced in v6.19&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initramfs that bind mounts its modules over the rootfs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional concatenation of multiple initramfs in the bootloader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ten minutes, you’ll see how these changes raise the netboot FITness of Linux, so you can keep printk-debugging to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The linux kernel driver model has grown over the years and acquired several different mechanisms for passing device configuration data to platform drivers. This configuration can come from firmware (device-tree, ACPI) or from the kernel code itself (board-files, MFD, auxiliary drivers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a less experienced driver developer, the different APIs that are used to access device properties can be quite confusing and lead to questions: should I use the OF routines? Maybe fwnode or the generic device properties? What are software nodes in this model and what even is a device property? How are devices linked according to their provider-consumer relationship and their probe order ensured, if at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the history and evolution of device properties - from legacy, custom platform data structures, through the introduction of the open-firmware API and its generalization to firmware nodes alongside other fwnode implementations up to the generic device property API. It will also touch on the devlinks and how they tie into this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this beginner/intermediate level talk is to give a clear picture of how device configuration should be handled in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A new RFC for Netfilter/nftables arrived recently in the netfilter-devel mailing list [1], introducing flexible math operation support for network packet fields. This could solve some migration problems from iptables to nftables and in addition empower other use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demo will quickly show how it works with simple real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Combining Trace(r)s: Kernel ftrace &amp; LTTng UST</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tracing complex systems often requires insights from both the kernel and userspace. While tools like Linux's ftrace excel at kernel-level observability and LTTng provides low-overhead userspace tracing, unifying these disparate data sources for a holistic view remains a challenge: using LTTng for kernel tracing requires an out-of-tree kernel module, which can be a barrier for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces bt2-ftrace-to-ctf - a new open-source project designed to bridge this gap. Our solution processes a trace.dat file from ftrace (kernel part) and a LTTng UST for userspace, then aligns and rewrites the trace in the Common Trace Format (CTF), as used by LTTng. The resulting output is directly consumable by tools like Trace Compass, enabling comprehensive, synchronized analysis of system behavior across all layers without the need for custom kernel modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project consists of two key components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Babeltrace2 plugin: This plugin allows babeltrace2 to directly read trace-cmd's trace.dat files, providing a standardized interface for ftrace data. It includes source and sink components for flexible data handling and metadata emission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trace.dat to CTF converter: This utility utilizes the Babeltrace2 plugin to transform ftrace data into an LTTng-alike kernel trace in CTF format. Crucially, it can also combine this kernel trace with an existing LTTng userspace trace, producing a single, unified trace directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk, we will give an overview on the tool and discuss challenges during its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project: https://github.com/siemens/bt2-ftrace-to-ctf (MIT, LGPL-2.1-or-later)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Creating filesystem images typically requires mounting, copying files, and hoping your build environment doesn't introduce non-determinism. New capabilities in mkfs.xfs solve both problems.
You can now populate an XFS filesystem directly from a directory tree at creation time, no mount required. 
I'll cover the implementation approach, discuss design, and show how to use it.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Correctness of operating system kernel code is very important.  Testing is helpful, but does not always thoroughly uncover all issues.  In the Whisper team at Inria, we are exploring the possibility of applying formal verification, using Frama-C, to Linux kernel code.  This entails writing specifications, constructing loop invariants, and checking correctness with the support of a SMT solver.  This talk will report on the opportunities and challenges encountered.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most SoCs provide a PWM controller which it used mainly to drive LEDs, a display backlight or a fan. Less often a PWM controls a motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motor use case has a higher demand for exact control of the produced output. In the development cycle for Linux 6.13, the preferred abstraction for a PWM driver changed to be able to fulfill these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick introduction about what a PWM actually does, Uwe (who is also the Linux PWM subsystem maintainer) will present the new API with its requirements and the hardware and software he uses to develop and test a driver.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sheaves are a new percpu caching layer for the SLUB allocator. To some extent it's a return to the SLAB percpu arrays (and magazines in the original Bonwick's paper), but avoiding the pitfalls of the SLAB implementation, attempting to get the best of both SLAB and SLUB approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 6.18 sheaves were merged and enabled for maple node and VMA caches. There's ongoing work to fully convert all caches in 7.0. This talk will discuss the status, explain the tradeoffs involved and present some results and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>TPMs and the Linux Kernel: unlocking a better path to hardware security</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="kernel">Kernel</track>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;TPMs have been present in modern laptops and servers for some time now, but their adoption is quite low. While operating systems do provide some security features based on TPMs (think of BitLocker on Windows or dm-verity on Linux) third party applications or libraries usually do not have TPM integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons of low TPM adoption is that interfacing with TPMs is quite hard: there are competing TPM software stacks (Intel vs IBM), lack of key format standardization (currently being worked on) and many operating systems are not set up from the start to make TPM easily available (TPM device file is owned by root or requires privileged group for access). Even with a proper software stack the application may have to deal with low-level TPM communication protocols, which are hard to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will explore a better integration of TPMs with some Linux Kernel subsystems, in particular: kernel keystore and cryptographic API. We will see how it allows the Linux Kernel to expose hardware-based security to third party applications in an easy to use manner by encapsulating the TPM communication complexities as well as providing higher-level use-case based security primitives.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of Secure Boot is now well established (and widely used in Linux for nearly 15) years.  Most people now decline to take ownership of their systems (by replacing the CA keys in the UEFI db variable) and instead pivot trust away from the UEFI variables to the MoK (Machine Owner Key) ones instead, which can be updated from the operating system.  Thus if you want to secure boot your own kernel, you usually create a signing key and load that into MoK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go quickly over the history, how you take ownership, what problems you encounter, how you create and install your own signing keys in MoK and how the kernel imports all these keys into the keyring system and uses them (verifying module signatures and IMA signed policy) including the differences betwen the machine and secondary_trusted keyrings.  We'll also discuss some of the more recent innovations, like adding SBAT to the rather problematic UEFI revocation story and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>usermode linux without MMU</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Usermode Linux (UML) has been developed and maintained in linus tree for decades and well used by kernel developers as an instant way of virtualization within userspace processes, without relying on hypervisor (i.e., qemu/kvm) or software partition (i.e., namespace).  Recently unit testing framework for kernel tree, KUnit, bases UML as an underlying infrastructure for the framework, which brings us more opportunities to use UML.  However, this testing capability of KUnit+UML is currently limited to MMU-full codebase where there are certain portion of code with &lt;code&gt;ifndef CONFIG_MMU&lt;/code&gt; in the kernel tree.  As a result, nommu code lacks the chance of testability and often introduces regressions in the rapid development cycle of linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces yet-another extension to UML, based on the architecture without MMU emulation, in order to exercise nommu code with a plenty of testing framework implemented on KUnit+UML .  The kernel is configured with the option &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_MMU=n&lt;/code&gt;, and we've implemented a different syscall hook and handling mechanisms with the different interactions to the host processes.  With that, existing userspace programs (we've used Alpine Linux image with patched busybox/musl-libc) can run over this UML instance under nommu environment.
As a bonus using different implementation to the host interactions, we got speedups in several workloads we've tested including &lt;code&gt;lmbench&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;netperf&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;iperf3&lt;/code&gt; benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly overview its implementation, the comparison with the original UML architecture, and share several measurement results obtained during the development.  We will also share the upstreaming status which we have been proposed [*1].&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At Chainguard, we want to re-use binary objects across Linux kernel builds of different major versions. For us this is useful for FIPS certification of individual kernel components while still allowing us to build new kernels and not pin the entire kernel forever.
To achieve this, we performed a number of experiments with the kernel build system and spoke to other kernel developers about  their efforts to achieve the same thing.
I will discuss approaches to re-using binary objects, the limits of each, and how the linux kernel could have a stable(r) ABI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This live demo shows how to pick a real syzbot-reported bug and reproduce it locally in under five minutes using virtme-ng.
No disk images, no complex QEMU setup—just build, reproduce and verify the fix.
Perfect for anyone who wants to turn kernel fuzzing reports into real patches.
Important note: I am going to use pre-built upstream kernel containing a bug due to the talk time constarins. Hovewer, steps to rebuild an upstream kernel and use it in virtme-ng will be described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Description:
syzbot continually discovers kernel issues, but reproducing them can be slow or intimidating.
In this lightning talk, we’ll use virtme-ng to rebuild a mainline kernel and instantly run a real syzbot reproducer inside an ephemeral VM.
We’ll trigger the crash, inspect the backtrace, apply the upstream fix, and rerun the test to verify the resolution—all live.
This workflow reduces setup time from hours to minutes and lowers the entry barrier for new contributors.
Every attendee will leave knowing how to reproduce syzbot bugs safely and efficiently on their own system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Experiments &amp;amp; Demonstrations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an active syzbot issue (syzbot.appspot.com) and show its reproducer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a mainline kernel and launch it via virtme-run --kdir . --repro repro.c.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trigger the crash and display kernel backtrace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the upstream patch or manual fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-run the reproducer and verify crash disappearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use virtme-ng for instant kernel test environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run real syzbot reproducer without manual QEMU setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe, patch, and verify kernel bugs live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage new contributors to validate fuzzing results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a fully reproducible workflow in &amp;lt; 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>What Is Still Missing in System Call Tracing</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk follows last year's presentation "Status and Desiderata for Syscall Tracing and Virtualization Support" and reports on progress and remaining gaps in Linux system call tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk presents a set of Linux kernel patches, intended for upstream submission, that address the following limitations and aim to make system call tracing and virtualization more expressive, portable, and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, support for PTRACE_SET_SYSCALL_INFO has been merged into the mainline kernel. While developing a portable version of VUOS across multiple architectures, several limitations of the current tracing interfaces became evident. In particular, skipping a system call by setting its number to -1 is insufficient, as it does not allow the tracer to control the return value or errno, nor to adjust the program counter. As a consequence, the current VUOS proof-of-concept replaces skipped system calls with getpid and fixes up the return value at PTRACE_SYSCALL_INFO_EXIT, doubling the number of context switches and incurring a measurable performance cost. Updating the program counter currently requires non-portable, architecture-specific code using PTRACE_POKEUSER or PTRACE_SETREGSET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional issues arise with seccomp_unotify. Tracing all system calls is difficult because file descriptors must be transferred from the traced task to the tracer; common techniques based on UNIX domain sockets and ancillary messages require sendmsg and recvmsg themselves to be excluded from tracing.  Furthermore, there is currently no support for virtualizing the F_DUPFD command of fcntl, nor for allowing a tracer to atomically close a file descriptor in the traced process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Power saving has always been a major preoccupation in embedded systems, as by definition, they could have energy constraints. As embedded systems become increasingly pervasive, from IoT devices to industrial controllers, power efficiency is more critical than ever. This talk is aimed at developers, system integrators, and Linux enthusiasts. Whether you’re optimizing a battery-powered board or a power sensitive industrial board, you’ll walk away with practical insights and actionable tools. 
This talk will explore how to reduce electrical consumption on an embedded Linux system by leveraging software techniques such as kernel low power state (Suspend-To-RAM, Suspend-To-Disk), devices management. We’ll cover how to disable unused peripherals or scale CPU and DDR frequencies&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Upstreaming kernel support traditionally happens only after silicon becomes available, but this approach often delays software enablement and ecosystem readiness. For the first time in the RISC-V world, we are tackling the challenge of pre-silicon kernel upstreaming—enabling Linux kernel features ahead of actual chip availability.
In this session, we will share the methodology, toolchains, and collaborative workflows that make this possible, including the use of simulation platforms, pre-silicon verification environments, and CI/CD integration for early kernel testing. Attendees will learn how these efforts accelerate software-hardware co-design, reduce bring-up cycles, and ensure that by the time silicon arrives, the kernel is already upstream-ready.
This pioneering approach not only shortens time-to-market but also sets a new model for open source hardware-software collaboration in the RISC-V ecosystem.
Key Takeaways:
- Why pre-silicon kernel upstreaming is a game-changer for RISC-V.
- The tools and processes used to validate and upstream before silicon.
- Lessons learned and best practices for collaborating with the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Rich Packet Metadata - The Saga Continues</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only way to attach a piece of information to an network packet (sk_buff) that will travel with it through the Linux network stack is the 32-bit mark field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once set, the mark can be read in firewall rules, used to drive routing, and accessed by BPF programs, among other uses. This versatility leads to fierce competition over the mark’s bits. Being just 32 bits wide, it often ends up limiting its practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why in 2024 we embarked on a journey to enable users to attach hundreds of bytes of metadata to network packets - a concept which we call "rich packet metadata" - which unblocks new and exciting applications such as:
* Tracing packets through layers of the network stack, even when crossing the kernel-user space barrier.
* Metadata-based packet redirection, routing, and socket steering with early packet classification in XDP.
* Extraction of information from encapsulation headers and passing it to user space, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have made significant progress since the project has started. Our journey ([1], [2]) to let BPF programs and user-space apps attach rich metadata to packets is far from over. In this talk, we'll share what's been done, what's next, what we've learned, and where are the dragons we've yet to slay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part I: Upstream Progress and Roadmap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why we shifted from the old "skb traits" idea [3] to reusing existing &lt;code&gt;skb&lt;/code&gt; metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How &lt;code&gt;bpf_dynptr&lt;/code&gt; came to the rescue, and why &lt;code&gt;skb-&amp;gt;data_meta&lt;/code&gt; still haunts us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blockers that keep metadata from traveling cleanly through the Rx path and how we plan to fix them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our roadmap for making metadata work on the Tx path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas for producing and consuming metadata directly in the network stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part II: Lessons from Production&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our last update [2], we've built several features with packet metadata in Cloudflare's production environment. We'll share hard-earned lessons, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing metadata contents and optimizing metadata area size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a TLV structure to encode metadata, and how we shuffle it between packet data, metadata area, and maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-world challenges of reading and writing metadata efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing metadata from packet to socket layers, with full access for TCP via socket options—and our creative hacks for UDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll discuss where things still hurt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing headaches and why &lt;code&gt;BPF_PROG_RUN&lt;/code&gt; needs love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What an ideal user API would look like for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're curious about where packet metadata is headed, or want to help shape the future, this session is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cluster orchestrators such as Kubernetes rely on an accurate model of the resources available on each worker node in a cluster and on the resources a given job requires, using this information to place the job onto a suitable worker node in the cluster. If either is inaccurate, the orchestrator will make poor job placement decisions, resulting in poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I observe that Linux kernel scheduling overheads can, for workloads making heavy use of Linux's group scheduling (cgroups) which include common serverless workloads, become so significant as to make the orchestrator model of worker node resources inaccurate. In practice this effect is mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose and evaluate an enhancement to the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) that mitigates these effects. By prioritising task completion over strict fairness, the enhanced scheduler is able to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly and reduce time lost to context switching. Experimental results show that this approach can deliver equivalent performance using up at least 10% fewer worker nodes, significantly improving cluster efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a global open ecosystem to build a Euroshack. Inspired by the Frugal Manifesto, we envision the Euroshack as the first agile prototype of a truly open EuroStack: modest in form, ambitious in purpose. Grounded in pragmatism and powered by free and open software, the Euroshack avoids nationalist overtones and instead champions a scalable, dependable core. “Shack” is a humble name, but it reflects a bold mission: to secure digital sovereignty and protect our electronic freedoms in Europe from the mood swings of oligarchs. With its modular, adaptable structure, the Euroshack is built to grow, evolve, and empower.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Europe has bold ambitions for open source and digital sovereignty, yet most initiatives struggle to deliver meaningful change where it matters: at the level of local institutions. Despite strong strategies and political commitments, implementation stalls because the policy frameworks guiding European digital transformation ignore a simple truth. Europe is built on a multi-level governance system where local actors carry the responsibility for execution but lack the incentives, support, and capacity to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on hands-on experience from Denmark’s OS2 (&lt;a href="https://os2.eu"&gt;os2.eu&lt;/a&gt;) community, where more than 85% of municipalities jointly develop and maintain open source solutions, this talk examines why current EU-level open source policy risks failing in practice. It unpacks three systemic barriers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak incentives at local level:&lt;/strong&gt; Municipalities lack resources, competencies, and organisational maturity to prioritise open source adoption. Financial savings are not an effective incentive, because open source is not a budget trick; it requires long-term investment in capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-level governance creates structural friction:&lt;/strong&gt; Authority is distributed across EU, national, and local levels. While this strengthens democracy, it fragments responsibility. National governments centralise; local authorities implement without adequate support; and EU ambitions rarely translate into actionable change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendor dominance distorts procurement and advice:&lt;/strong&gt; Large IT vendors shape decision-making, reinforce proprietary dependency, and overshadow sovereign alternatives. The barriers are governance- and leadership-related, not technical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk ends with practical policy recommendations: risk-bearing EU capital for local transitions, stronger alignment between EU-level commitments and local implementation realities, and a cultural shift where every new digital project must explicitly break with “doing things the way we always have”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speaker bio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmus Frey is Chief Executive and Secretary at OS2 (&lt;a href="https://os2.eu"&gt;os2.eu&lt;/a&gt;), Denmark’s open-source community for public digital collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He works at the intersection of governance, innovation, and technology, helping municipalities and public institutions co-develop and reuse digital solutions through open collaboration and shared ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmus contributes to European networks on open-source governance and digital sovereignty, with a focus on institutional design and democratic digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Roundtable discussion with policymakers and the community: how can the public procurement framework, that is currently being reformed, be used to achieve digital sovereignty goals? Open Source provides many answers to the questions digital sovereignty raises, but how can public procurers be empowered to buy more Open Source, what are their expectations, and what hurdles exist?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The recently proposed Digital Omnibus aims to simplify a series of digital regulations, such as the GDPR, the Data Act and other laws, such as the ePrivacy directive. The goal of this legislative package is to reduce administrative burdens on organisations and boost innovation, although it can have significant impacts on open source communities, foundations and SMEs building open-source software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Matrix as a case study, this talk will go through the areas of the Omnibus proposal which might have potential impacts on the wider FOSDEM community, namely proposals around redefinition of key concepts, changes to incident reporting requirements (and how they align with CRA requirements) and data sharings. It also aims to identify opportunities which might be brought on by the Omnibus, particularly around standardisation of approaches and improved collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present &lt;a href="https://howtheyvote.eu"&gt;HowTheyVote.eu&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open-source website that makes roll-call votes in the European Parliament more accessible and transparent. We briefly showcase the site’s features and how we built it, focusing on the different official data sources we combine. We will discuss good and not-so-good practices of the European Parliament’s websites and take stock of what we learned from four years of scraping parliamentary data. Lastly, we present examples of &lt;a href="https://howtheyvote.eu"&gt;HowTheyVote.eu&lt;/a&gt; data being used in journalism, research, and civil society, showcasing how accessible voting records can inform debates and thus ultimately strengthen European democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament is the only directly democratically elected EU institution, and, as such, the voting behavior of its members is of particular interest. With a significantly larger number of right-wing MEPs since last year's elections, keeping an eye on the developments in Parliament has become more important than ever. Although the Parliament publishes information such as roll-call vote results and plenary minutes on its website, it can be difficult to find out what exactly MEPs voted on or how a particular vote turned out, as the data is scattered across multiple sources, published in different formats, and made available at different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started &lt;a href="https://howtheyvote.eu"&gt;HowTheyVote.eu&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 as a free and open-source project to address these problems. On &lt;a href="https://howtheyvote.eu"&gt;HowTheyVote.eu&lt;/a&gt;, users can search for votes and view results. We also publish our entire &lt;a href="https://github.com/howTheyVote/data"&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; under an open-data license.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What if open source software projects could receive ongoing and sustaining funding from the corporations that use those project commercially — without changing the license or charging a fee for usage? This may sound self-contradictory; soon, it may be more than theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Article 25 of the Cyber Resilience Act, one can see that the European Commission has the opportunity to create a Delegated Act for Voluntary Security Attestations. This could open a path for open source project maintainers, stewards, or third parties to reduce manufacturer's cybersecurity compliance obligations in exchange for sustained funding. The exchange benefits companies by reducing their compliance costs, but without turning the open source foundation into a manufacturer itself, without assuming liability, and without jeopardizing a steward's non-profit status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Æva Black will introduce their ongoing work with the Eclipse Foundation to develop an understanding of how such a programme might function and how it might impact different segments of our community-of-communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation is part one of a two-part series.  Part two will feature a panel discussion with representatives of open source foundations and the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;In Article 25 of the Cyber Resilience Act, one can see that the European Commission has the opportunity to create a Delegated Act for Voluntary Security Attestations. This could open a path to reduce manufacturer's CRA-related compliance costs in exchange for support for the volunteers maintaining open source projects -- and to do this without becoming a manufacturer, without assuming liability, and without jeopardizing a steward's non-profit status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this panel, we will hear different perspectives on how this could improve the sustainability of open source across Europe, explore the potential impacts of different approaches, and invite audience participation and questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation is part two of a two-part series. In part one, Æva introduced their ongoing work with the Eclipse Foundation to develop a holistic view of how such a program might function.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The European Commission’s report on Regulation 1025 openly acknowledges what practitioners have long observed: the EU standardisation system is struggling to deliver the kinds of outcomes needed to support the Union’s ambitious push into digital regulation. In this presentation, Tobie draws on his long experience driving large-scale standardisation efforts in organisations such as OASIS, W3C, JDF, Ecma, and the WHATWG, as well as on his work introducing open-source development practices within them. He will discuss why these practices work, the benefits they bring, how they could be adopted by the European Standardisation Organisations, and which transition mechanisms could help bridge the gap until the ESOs are able to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;F3D is a fast and minimalist open source 3D viewer designed to handle a wide range of formats, from simple 3D meshes to complex volumetric datasets. Its goal is to make 3D visualization accessible, lightweight, and efficient across platforms.
Anyone with a 3D model on their computer definitely wants to install and use F3D to quickly and efficiently view their 3D models. From gamedev, to simulations researchers, via graphical artists, F3D provides value to many different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate thumbnails for all your 3D files in your file manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double click and view your models easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard centric interactions for efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLI oriented with dozens of options and configuration file support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++/Python/javascript API for devs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will cover the different use cases the F3D can help with and solve actual issues the 3D users have been having for a long time without resorting to much bigger softwares like Blender or ParaView.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Graphite is reinventing open source design tools by combining vector and raster workflows through a node-based, procedural approach borrowed from the 3D industry. We did already give a lightning talk at the last FOSDEM, but since then a lot has changed. We now have a desktop app in addition to the web based UI and have worked on a bunch of features and UX improvements. In this talk, we'll give an Overview of what Graphite is and what we have achieved over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The GNU Image Manipulation Program (&lt;a href="https://www.gimp.org/"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt;) is Community-driven Free software for high-end image creation and manipulation. Last year GIMP celebrated its 30th birthday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2025 the GNU Image Manipulation Program team team was proud to release &lt;a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2025/03/16/gimp-3-0-released/"&gt;GIMP 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. This represented the culmination of 7 years of hard work done by members of the GIMP community. Many major and long-awaited features were introduced including non-destructive editing, multi-layer operations, infinite canvas, more advanced colour management and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GIMP team had made a decision that starting with the 3.0 release the length of development cycles would be reduced. This has been followed, and has lead to the next big release - the 3.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today a core developer who joined the team within the past year presents the latest release of GIMP, takes a look at what's being worked on by the members of the GIMP community, and shares the experience of becoming a GIMP developer. You can look forward to hearing something about all the file formats GIMP aims to support, full CMYK mode, improved text support, hardware-accelerated image operations and more!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We're building Podlibre—an open-source, cross-platform podcast editor designed specifically for podcasters' workflows, not adapted from music production tools. This is a work-in-progress demo and call for feedback from the FOSS audio community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why podcasters need their own tool:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most podcasters currently rely on DAWs like Audacity, Ardour, or Reaper—tools designed for musicians with workflows that don't match podcast production. Podcasters need noise reduction, mouth click removal, transcript editing synchronized with audio, chapter markers, metadata management (ID3, RSS, Podcasting 2.0 tags), and one-click publishing—not MIDI sequencing or complex mixing boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we'll show you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live WIP demo&lt;/strong&gt; of Podlibre's plugin-based architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated transcription&lt;/strong&gt; running locally on your laptop—no cloud services required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript correction UI&lt;/strong&gt; optimized for keyboard-only editing (inspired by Aegisub but podcast-focused)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow customization&lt;/strong&gt;: how our plugin system lets you build your own production pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing integrations&lt;/strong&gt;: direct export to Castopod, Funkwhale, Faircamp, and local storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we need from you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podlibre is funded by Ad Aures (creators of Castopod) and NLnet, currently in active development. We're here to gather feedback from the FOSS audio community: What features matter? What libraries should we integrate? How can we build bridges with existing audio tools (PipeWire, LV2, VST)?&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What does it take nowadays to get the most out of your Linux system so that it can be used as a music production power house? This talk will explore the possibilities and hand some guidelines to squeeze out as much headroom your system has for all those resource hungry plugins. Along the way some myths might get debunked and some helpful tools will get introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I will walk through how to set up your system so it can do low-latency real-time audio. With low-latency I mean round-trip latencies below 10 ms. I will show which tools can help with getting your system to perform better for doing music production. Such tools include &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/rtcqs/rtcqs" title="rtcqs"&gt;rtcqs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/gaheldev/Millisecond" title="Millisecond"&gt;Millisecond&lt;/a&gt; for finding and fixing possible bottlenecks, jack_iodelay or &lt;a href="https://ardour.org" title="Ardour"&gt;Ardour&lt;/a&gt; for measuring round-trip latencies and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Gimmeapill/xruncounter" title="xruncounter"&gt;xruncounter&lt;/a&gt; to do DSP load stress tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also look backward briefly to 15 years ago when I did a similar talk at the &lt;a href="http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2011/recordings/day1_1400_Configuring_your_system_for_low-latency_real-time_audio_processing.ogv" title="Video of my talk about system configuration during LAC2011 in Maynooth"&gt;Linux Audio Conference in Maynooth&lt;/a&gt;, what has changed since then, what has improved? I will also glare a bit at the future as the Linux Audio Conference will be held in Maynooth again this year and chances are I will dive deeper into this matter during that conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk you will hopefully have a better grasp of what the key factors are for getting a better performing machine that has as little of those dreaded xruns as possible!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk demonstrates how to build a wireless MIDI controller using Elixir, ESP32 microcontrollers, and AtomVM, proving that functional programming can run efficiently on resource-constrained embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore how BEAM VM's lightweight processes and message-passing model naturally fit embedded systems programming, particularly for real-time applications like MIDI. The session covers practical implementation details: WiFi connectivity, UDP networking, MIDI message generation, and interfacing with physical controls like knobs and faders on ESP32-C3 hardware with just 400KB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn about AtomVM's subset of the BEAM VM designed for microcontrollers and the potential for building distributed music applications. We'll discuss how networked MIDI enables new possibilities for multi-device music systems and collaborative performance setups built on BEAM's distributed computing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is fully open source and demonstrates a compelling use case for Elixir beyond traditional web services, showing how the language's concurrency model excels in IoT and real-time embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past years we developed &lt;a href="https://cardinal.kx.studio/"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source eurorack simulation audio plugin based on &lt;a href="https://vcvrack.com/"&gt;VCV Rack&lt;/a&gt;. It integrates over 1300 modules, is available under the GPL-3.0-or-later license and comes in various plugin formats (lv2/vst2/vst3/clap/au) and configurations (synth/fx/main).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we explain the reasons for starting the project and how we think this improves the original Rack for running as an audio plugin. We will also showcase some tips and tricks for integrating with the plugin host and some advanced use cases like running it on embedded hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MBROLA and eSpeak NG are two speech synthesizers that can be used as MIDI instruments. MBROLA has been often uses for singing synthesis, because it allows you to control timing and pitch via its text interface. It became free software in 2018. Before 2018 I was already listening to a lot of VOCALOID and UTAU music, and I began researching how to implement my own singing speech synthesizer by reading "An introduction to text-to-speech synthesis" by Thierry Dutoit (author of MBROLA) and many other papers related to VOCALOID and UTAU. With a deep understanding how the MBROLA algorithm works I began to implement my own independant singing voice synthesizer, with eSpeak as an optional frontend.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Become an orchestra composer using FOSS!</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I made a presentation called "Become a rockstar using FOSS!": it was a clickbait-y title, since I'm (obviously) not a rockstar at all, but it was a nice opportunity to introduce people to the music production ecosystem in Linux, which is huge and yet not that known to most. At the time, I mostly talked about the typical workflow for creating and recording music with either real or virtual instruments, but with a focus more on rock/pop music, in order to keep things simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll address a different point of view, that is how you can have a full symphonic orchestra in your laptop, write music for it and then have it performed in ways that are hopefully realistic enough to be used within the context of your compositions (unless you know 80 people that can play your music for you, that is!). I'll present my typical workflow, and the different pieces of software I used to make it possible for me to write purely classical music (symphonic poems), but also orchestral arrangements for songs in different genres (e.g., folk, progressive rock or metal) that I published as a hobby in my free time over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a clickbait title because I'm not really an orchestra composer... but FOSS definitely helped make me feel like one, and it can help you too!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;h1&gt;How to produce music with Linux/FLOSS professionally&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real penguins do not need apples to make music...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case study on how an &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; Linux/FLOSS based production chain can be a viable alternative to the proprietary/paid one(s). I will concentrate on the production of a pop song, from the draft to the full-fledged, platform-ready master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many topics will be briefly discussed here: hardware, tools, practices, objectives, comparisons and interoperability and whatever; all you need to know to get the job done, professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some links related to this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RCGfQJ_T4aw?si=KnxGmCJsJhRoPm5K"&gt;“Oh Nena”&lt;/a&gt;, the finished song&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a great language for it’s ease and low barrier to entry, fast turnaround workflows, and trying quick experiments. It’s generally not so great for real-time tasks, such as music playback or for working with live musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, that’s what this library does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we look at how the midi-live-performer library can act as a real-time MIDI looper, echo unit, and auto-accompaniment system. There’s a slight detour to show midi-info, which provides user-friendly names for MIDI messages, both in real-time and not. Then we explain how it works, where the weaknesses in timing lay, and how it formed the basis for a solo recording of the multi-instrumentalist work “In C”&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I've been prototyping &lt;a href="https://lambein.xyz/paw-live2023/"&gt;PAW&lt;/a&gt;, a DAW based on ideas from live coding and bidirectional programming. Like with live coding, in PAW you write code to describe a piece of music incrementally. As part of this, you also build a GUI for direct manipulation of that same code, providing similar affordances to traditional DAWs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAW stems from my observations that regular DAWs tend to be limited in what they let users do, due to fundamental limitations with traditional GUIs. I believe that mixing in ideas from live coding, and programming at large, can help savvy users shed those limitations, while retaining familiar GUI affordances and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software is open source, but not yet quite usable. My goal with this talk is to share ideas with other people in the field of music production software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Music ensembles are moving from sheet music to tablets with PDFs. Many apps exists but all are focuses on individual musicians, not on bands. Rehorse is a web app with offline support that can be self-hosted by a band. The band librarian makes the music available to the band members. They can annotate the sheet music, practice with recordings with convenient section repeats.
The app lists rehearsal and concert playlists and has (optional) access management to prevent members from downloading all parts, but e.g. only those from their section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings and sheet music are stored offline so the sheet music is available even at performances where no network is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehorse has been under development and in use in several bands for years. This talk invites new users and potential contributors. It goes into the workflows that musicians expect and the high standards that they are used to from other apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will share the insights we gained while building Myrmic, our open-source Rust middleware for distributed systems, with a particular focus on our microcontroller firmware that enables running WebAssembly on resource-constrained targets such as Nordic and ESP devices. Our entire stack is Rust-based—from Embassy firmware and the embedded HAL to the Wasm toolchain and the runtimes themselves. We will outline the requirements that running Wasm in &lt;code&gt;no_std&lt;/code&gt; environments imposes on runtimes, particularly in the context of distributed systems with constrained devices. We will then share our experience with Rust-native runtimes such as wasmtime, wasmi, and tinywasm and with embedding WAMR into Rust firmware, focusing on how each runtime aligned with these requirements and the modifications or integration work needed to support our use case. We will also discuss how we structure and compile our Wasm modules, and the trade-offs we make between developer ergonomics, code portability, and the memory footprint of the resulting binaries. The goal of this talk is to provide practical lessons for Rust developers, highlight gaps in today’s embedded-Wasm tooling, and point out opportunities for new open-source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the Rust embedded-hal v1.0 now released almost two years ago, Rust is really ready for bare metal embedded deployments. This talk will look at cheap RISC-V MCUs like the CH32V003 featuring (RPi Pico or Teensy style for less than EUR 1.30) and show you hands-on how you may develop your embedded system using bare metal Rust. From zero to main, using probe-rs for flashing and debugging, IDE integration thereof and some tricks like successfully using no-std for the tiniest footprint possible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tired of the endless “search, copy, paste, test” routine, last year’s FOSDEM helped me break out of that loop thanks to two unexpected sparks: Rust and retrogaming. In this talk, I’ll share how discovering Rust and the Game Boy homebrew scene rekindled my passion for creating software bare metal, bringing back the artistic and playful side of programming. We’ll explore the current state of the Rust ecosystem for GB, GBC, and GBA development — from compilers and minimalist engines to demo ROMs and the ongoing work bridging these two worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Async Rust in Godot 4: Leveraging the engine as a runtime</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot"&gt;Godot 4&lt;/a&gt;’s built-in async support for GDScript has long been a powerful feature - but what about Rust? In February 2025, I implemented async support for Godot’s Rust bindings (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;godot-rust&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), enabling Rust developers to write async code without introducing external runtimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll walk you through the architecture: how we adapted Godot’s async execution (already designed for GDScript) to work with Rust’s &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; abstractions, and how we minimized cost by reusing the engine’s existing event loop and task scheduler. We’ll dive into the implementation details - including how Godot-specific futures are constructed, polled, and scheduled - and discuss the challenges we faced when implementing &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; while interacting with the engine's C++ code over FFI on potentially multiple threads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be especially valuable for developers interested in embedding async logic godot and other game engines or understanding how async can be made “engine-native” rather than externally bolted on.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Common Expression Language (&lt;a href="https://cel.dev"&gt;CEL&lt;/a&gt;) is an expression language that’s fast, portable, and safe to execute in performance-critical applications. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/cel-rust/cel-rust/"&gt;CEL crate&lt;/a&gt; provides a parser and interpreter for the language that emerged from Google, but never provided an implementation for Rust.
Given its traits, CEL is the perfect match for any Rust project that requires some sort of expression evaluation. We'll cover why that is the case and where these needs emerged from, then dive into the state of the Rust port of the interpreter, covering some of the challenges met along the way, like reviving the Rust runtime for &lt;a href="https://github.com/antlr4rust/antlr4"&gt;antlr4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Roto is a statically-typed and compiled scripting language for Rust applications that integrates very tightly with Rust. To achieve that integration, it needs to interface directly with Rust types and functions. Implementing that boundary turned out to be quite tricky! We had many obstacles to overcome, such as Rust providing very few mechanisms for reflection and not providing a stable ABI by default. This talk will explain how Rust-Roto boundary works and the tricks we have to pull along the way. You can expect lots of unsafe code, deep dives into the Rust Reference and coercions from slices to function pointers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Full rewrite from C++ to Rust or gradual integration with Rust libraries? For a large C++ codebase, only the latter works, but even then, there are many complications and rough edges. In my presentation, I will describe our experience integrating Rust and C++ code and some weird and unusual problems we had to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces &lt;a href="parca.dev"&gt;Parca&lt;/a&gt;, a general-purpose CPU, GPU and memory profiler for Linux. The main unique feature of Parca is the fact that unwinding happens in an eBPF program, and so is low-overhead enough to be constantly running in production: it doesn't require building with frame pointers or copying large sections of the stack between memory spaces. The primary mode of visualization in the Parca UI is the flame graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust-specific features in Parca include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) For those projects that use jemalloc, memory profiling via &lt;a href="https://github.com/polarsignals/rust-jemalloc-pprof"&gt;rust-jemalloc-pprof&lt;/a&gt;
(2) "Custom labels" feature for associating arbitrary application-relevant tags with stack traces (for example: allowing the user to filter profiles by trace ID or any other value they choose to instrument).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Python dominates web development, but they often comes with performance and
scaling issues. Recently, the Python ecosystem has seen massive performance gains
from projects written in Rust, such as &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ruff&lt;/code&gt;. But what other projects
are out there to help Python scale thanks to Rust? At Cloudsmith, we achieved 2x
throughput on our 8-year-old Django monolith by integrating Rust-based tools and
contributed features back upstream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll look at a number of projects that helped us start bringing Rust into our
stack. We'll go over our methodology: establishing performance baselines through
load testing, identifying bottlenecks, and scaling issues. We integrated existing
Rust-based tools with minimal code changes and tuned application server
configuration for maximum throughput, consolidating infrastructure and reducing
operational complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also share our experience contributing observability features upstream to
Granian, ensuring production-ready monitoring that benefits the entire
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll leave with actionable strategies for modernising legacy services using
existing Rust tools, understanding when this approach makes sense, and
maintaining production reliability throughout the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects we used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://pyo3.rs/&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/"&gt;Ty&lt;/a&gt; is a fast Python type checker and language server. Ty is built with Rust, and there are a lot of interesting technical challenges involved in making it a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a Python type checker is a hard task; however, the design of Ty provides a joyful developer experience for contributors. In this talk, we will look at how the Ty codebase is structured to make development simple, and what design choices make it pleasant to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover:
- How Ty goes from a Python program to a diagnostic, and what parts are most important if you want to contribute.
- Data layout and ownership model of structs in Rust.
- Salsa solves challenge of incremental type checking across many files.
- Tooling for tests, snapshot testing during development and type checking open source projects in CI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;From its timid introduction to the &lt;a href="https://mercurial-scm.org"&gt;Mercurial Version Control System&lt;/a&gt; back in 2017 to its more than 50k lines of code today, Rust has enabled a wide range of improvements, some of which we wager would have been impossible if not for Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how we reach far beyond the obvious point of "Rust runs faster than Python". It discusses aspects like maintainability, dependency management, API re-designs, opportunities for more advanced algorithms, on disk data-structures, safe parallelism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present our rare perspective of working on a 20 year-old codebase with half-a-million lines of Python code, in a software niche with quite extreme goals. Mercurial aims to provide instant-feeling commands with short lived processes for a local database of tens of millions of revisions for millions of files with fully distributed replication.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Git's internal design is both elegant and notoriously complex. Building reliable tooling on top of it means dealing with purpose-built data structures, performance trade-offs, and years of historical quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll explore how Rust, together with Gitoxide[0], makes it possible to create fast, correct, and ergonomic version-control tooling. We’ll look at how Rust’s ownership model and type system help avoid whole classes of errors, and how Gitoxide exposes a safe and composable interface to the raw Git data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using some real-world examples, we’ll walk through:
- How Git stores its data and why interacting with it is non-trivial
- How the Gitoxide APIs to make this tractable
- Patterns for building high-level Git workflows
- A short demo of how these pieces come together in the GitButler CLI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will come away with a deeper understanding of Git’s inner workings, practical insights into using Gitoxide, and perhaps ideas for creating next-gen developer tooling using Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu’s plan to “carefully but purposefully oxidise” the distro has given us the perfect playground to see what really happens when you swap decades-old GNU coreutils for their shiny Rust equivalents. Spoiler: everything relies on way more weird flags than you think — and significantly more than the internet’s finest armchair kernel engineers believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share the fun, the sharp edges, and the truly unexpected lessons from bringing Rust Coreutils (https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
) into Ubuntu: which obscure behaviours scripts secretly depend on, how packaging Essential tools can turn one missing corner-case into a boot failure, what benchmarks actually taught us (as opposed to what Reddit said they would), and how tools like oxidizr (https://github.com/jnsgruk/oxidizr
) let us safely flip between GNU and Rust without breaking the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we’ll look at some of the best online troll predictions — the “Rust will destroy Linux”, “this is rewriting for the sake of CVs”, and “it will be 100× slower forever” genre — and compare them with what happened in the real world. Some were wrong, some were surprisingly insightful, and some were… educational, in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious about modernizing the Linux system, if you enjoy data-driven myth-busting, or if you simply want field notes from the frontier of “C → Rust” rewrites, this session is for you.

        <title>Rethinking network services: Freedom and modularity with Rama</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern networking software often forces developers to choose between rigid, off-the-shelf frameworks and the painstaking effort of building everything from scratch. Rama takes a different path. It’s a modular Rust framework that lets you move and transform packets across the network stack, without giving up control, safety, or composability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll explore together with the audience how Rama’s philosophy of layers, services, and extensions turns network programming into a flexible and enjoyable experience. You’ll see how its building blocks span multiple layers of abstraction. From transport and TLS up to HTTP, and a lot more in between. All while you can still easily plug in your own logic or replace existing components. It also shows how you can build network stacks that aren't possible anywhere else, and all without a sweat. For example socks5 over TLS. Why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through practical examples, we’ll look at how Rama empowers developers to build everything from proxies and servers to custom network tools, while still benefiting from Rust’s performance and safety guarantees. Whether you’re curious about programmable networking, Rust’s async ecosystem, or just want to build things your own way, this talk will show you how Rama helps you do it, all with elegance and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about rama itself can be found at https://ramaproxy.org/, which is developed and maintained by https://plabayo.tech/, a FOSS, consulting and commercial technology (small family) company from Ghent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Random seeds and state machines: An approach to deterministic simulation testing in Rust</title>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deterministic simulation testing (DST) is a method that explores as many random execution paths of a system as possible, injects random failures, and lets developers reproduce the exact same execution path on failure given an initial random seed. This testing approach shakes out many difficult to find bugs before they reach production and greatly increases developer confidence in system correctness when making new changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DST was first popularized by the FoundationDB team, and is slowly finding its way into the testing arsenal of many products like TigerBeetle, Resonate, and more recently, Turso’s rewrite of SQLLite in Rust. This talk will cover how we implemented DST of our distributed storage system at Polar Signals by modelling our core components as state machines and why this was the right choice for us over other approaches that use deterministic async runtimes (e.g. https://github.com/madsim-rs/madsim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come learn more about DST and how it can help you write better and more resilient software!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Syd: Writing an application kernel in Rust</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitlab.exherbo.org/sydbox/sydbox/"&gt;Syd&lt;/a&gt; (sydbox-3) is an application kernel written in Rust. This talk is a tour of its runtime architecture and the Rust that makes it portable. We’ll walk through the threads and their roles: &lt;code&gt;syd_main&lt;/code&gt; (startup, namespaces, policy load, lock), &lt;code&gt;syd_mon&lt;/code&gt; (lifecycle, seccomp-notify plumbing), a CPU-sized pool of &lt;code&gt;syd_emu&lt;/code&gt; workers (syscall brokering), &lt;code&gt;syd_ipc&lt;/code&gt; (UNIX-socket control when &lt;a href="https://man.exherbo.org/syd.2.html#ipc"&gt;&lt;code&gt;lock:ipc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is enabled), &lt;code&gt;syd_int&lt;/code&gt; (timers/alarms), and &lt;code&gt;syd_aes&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;AF_ALG&lt;/strong&gt; crypto for &lt;a href="https://man.exherbo.org/syd.7.html#Crypt_Sandboxing"&gt;Crypt sandboxing&lt;/a&gt;, plus helpers &lt;code&gt;syd-pty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;syd-tor&lt;/code&gt;. Implementation highlights: minimal unsafe at the syscall edge; per-thread isolation with &lt;code&gt;unshare(CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES)&lt;/code&gt; and per-thread &lt;em&gt;seccomp&lt;/em&gt;(2); &lt;a href="https://man.exherbo.org/syd.7.html#Syscall_Argument_Cookies"&gt;syscall-argument cookies&lt;/a&gt;; forced &lt;strong&gt;O_CLOEXEC&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="https://man.exherbo.org/syd.7.html#Force_Randomized_File_Descriptors"&gt;randomized FDs&lt;/a&gt;; deterministic "last-match-wins" policy; and &lt;em&gt;mseal&lt;/em&gt;(2) sealing on &lt;code&gt;lock:on&lt;/code&gt;. Portability is first-class: one codebase for Linux ≥ 5.19 with proper multi-arch support (x86-64/x86/x32, arm64/armv7, ppc64{b,l}e, riscv64, s390x, loongarch64), ILP32/LP64 awareness, and MSRV 1.83+. You’ll leave with concrete patterns for building a thread-isolated, multi-arch syscall broker in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of carving tools out there, but surprisingly there's no open-source one for carving JSON objects. &lt;a href="https://www.reportersunited.gr/en/"&gt;Reporters United&lt;/a&gt;, a network of investigative reporters in Greece, wrote &lt;a href="https://github.com/reportersunited/json-carver"&gt;&lt;code&gt;json-carver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of our investigation into the &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/10/telemessage_archive_online/?td=readmore"&gt;Telemessage leaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://github.com/reportersunited/json-carver"&gt;&lt;code&gt;json-carver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a FOSS tool written in Rust, that can recover JSON objects from any binary stream, even partially-corrupted ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss the role of this tool in our investigation, compare its accuracy and speed against &lt;code&gt;strings(1)&lt;/code&gt;, and show how to use this tool in any of your future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bugbane is an open-source Android application that simplifies consensual forensics by building on Amnesty TechLab's Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT). Bugbane makes MVT's capabilities accessible to everyone through a user-friendly interface, allowing users to self-test in just a few minutes without needing a second device. It also enables periodic data acquisitions, supporting the analysis of past acquisitions with updated IoCs in an "acquire-now, detect-later" workflow. Bugbane reliably extracts and decodes key artifacts like installed apps, backups, and system logs, and allows users users to export AndroidQF-compatible age-encrypted archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to expand access and usage, helping users and supporting organizations work more efficiently, and reaching a broader audience, including less-technical individuals and communities currently outside civil-society support. In the longer term, Bugbane aims to strengthen the collection of open threat intelligence that can be shared with researchers, analysts, and civil-society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will introduce PUMA (Programmable Utility for Mobile Automation), an open-source Python tool developed by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. PUMA streamlines mobile app automation by allowing users to define high-level actions—like sending messages or searching in apps—without manual UI scripting. PUMA is designed for ease-of-use and reproducibility, making it ideal for testing, research, and workflow automation.
We’ll explore PUMA’s architecture, key features, and practical applications, from forensic purposes like generating reference datasets, educational purposes like how to validate your application, to personal use cases like automating repetitive tasks. Whether you’re a developer, tester, or automation enthusiast, discover how PUMA can save time, reduce errors, and unlock new possibilities in mobile automation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Fox-IT's Dissect has a huge collection of features and parsers, but what does it take to maintain those and, more importantly, make them easily usable and accessibly to analysts? Wondered how we made recursive hypervisor analysis a hell of a lot easier? Or why it's so ridiculously easy to build custom tools on top of Dissect? Join us as we take you on a tour of some of the features of Dissect, as well as the challenges that come with maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Activists and whistleblowers often handle sensitive documents that can incriminate both the exposed parties and themselves for acquiring or distributing the material. To move forward with their revelations, they must ensure they leave no identifiable trail. Enter &lt;a href="https://dangerzone.rocks/"&gt;Dangerzone&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source tool that sanitizes suspicious documents and removes incriminating metadata in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers metadata removal: concrete examples of how metadata has been used to de-anonymize authors and distributors, the limitations of current tools, and the challenges posed by adversaries who can apply advanced watermarking and tracing techniques to documents.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The absence of forensics data can be just as dangerous as the presence of malicious activity. While traditional digital forensics focuses on artefacts located on storage devices, containerized environments like Kubernetes introduce new challenges for collection of digital evidence from compromised applications, where malware now routinely leaves no traces. In this talk, we are going to explore how to collect, preserve, and analyse forensic snapshots with transparent checkpointing methods while maintaining a chain of custody to investigate security incidents. We will also discuss techniques for automation in real-world scenarios and best practices for capturing and analysing malicious activity in compromised containers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Someone on the internet told me I was wrong. Or, well, that my code was wrong. And a totally normal response to that is to spend over a month reverse engineering proprietary kernels and kernel modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? Well, once upon a time I was fed up with all the bugs in vmfs-tools and vmfs6-tools, so I wrote my own VMFS implementation. Except that I took a lot of shortcuts, and in doing so I inherited some of the same bugs! Fast forward to 2025, and those bugs are finally catching up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me as I go over the excruciating process of gathering decade old ESX(i) installation media, hunting for debug symbols, and trying to piece together how VMFS &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works. Oh, and fix that bug, of course.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software reverse engineering is a very useful tool in digital forensics. Not only can it tells us a lot about the inner workings of the software of interest, it can also lead us to quirks and even vulnerabilities not even available in the source (e.g. compiler quirks). With enough effort it even turns proprietary implementations into open-source, what's not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with a technique this powerful, there will always be downsides. Reverse engineering large binaries can be a monumental task. Where a few kB's of storage seem tiny, a few kB's of code can be huge if you have to reverse it all. A secondary problem to this, is that all this work is quite hard to reuse in the future. Binary code can differ, even with the same source, purely based on compiler options. SRE tools change, making your scripts obsolete. Decompilers change, making your signatures obsolete and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present an open-source machine learning model, server and Ghidra plugin for creating function signatures from aarch64 assembly. These function signatures can be stored and compared to a database of known functions to easily reuse all the blood, sweat and tears you put into reversing that library that has since been updated twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code is of course open source and available at https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/asmtransformers&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After working on a 12+ week project looking at how to express in the varied UI's of three package repositories (npm, pypi and RubyGems) we can now see more clearly what developers, across skill and knowledge levels, use in package repository pages to make a decision on the security of an OSS located on a registry. These decisions are critical for better understanding trust, value, social proof and the knowledge of secure practices across developers and helps answer the question: how much do developers know about the security of their software supply chain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover:
1. The essential user research findings from the project, 
2. How user research informed the UI style guide design build
3. What gaps and opportunities are here to continue design in the SBOM, Attestations and securing software repositories topics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We spend enormous amounts of time and money auditing code for security holes. Whole industries are built around it. But for all that effort, we rarely look at the part of the system that is actually clicking the buttons and interpreting the warnings. The person with Dorito dust on their fingers and a coffee ring permanently  branded on their desk, someone just trying to get things done in a tool that may or may not be helping them make safe decisions. A surprising number of real-world security failures happen not because the code is flawed, but because the interface leaves too much room for dangerous misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on our work at Ura with security-critical and open source projects, this talk explores how the user experience itself can introduce or amplify security risks and why these issues often slip through traditional code-focused reviews. We will look at memorable examples of user-driven failures, outline common UX surfaces where security risks emerge, and show why auditing the human side of the system is just as critical as auditing the code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source thrives on collaboration, yet many people with disabilities remain excluded from fully participating due to inaccessible communication, documentation, and community practices. “Debugging Exclusion” invites open source leaders, educators, and advocates to rethink how accessibility is built into community culture, not just code.
This talk focuses on solving the technical, social, and systemic barriers to disability inclusion in open source. Through practical frameworks and CHAOSS community success stories, participants will learn how to design inclusive contribution pathways, write accessible documentation, and measure inclusion using open metrics. Together, we’ll explore how accessible collaboration empowers creativity, broadens participation, and makes open source truly open for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Learning Outcomes:
-Recognise systemic accessibility issues in open source communities.
-Understand the accessibility barriers faced by contributors with disabilities.
-Learn to integrate accessibility testing tools and automation into open source workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gephi Lite&lt;/strong&gt; is a web-based open-source network visualization tool built by a three-person engineering team. After two years of development, we had a functional application—and a nagging feeling that our interface wasn't working for users. The problem: we lacked the skills to diagnose what was wrong, let alone fix it. So we brought in &lt;strong&gt;Arthur Desaintjan&lt;/strong&gt;, a design intern, to help us figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll share how we approached design at a pivotal moment in our project's life—first by stepping back to clarify what Gephi Lite should really be, then by running user interviews that revealed just how far our assumptions were from reality. We'll walk through the specific findings that surprised us, the design decisions that followed, and what small open-source teams can learn from our experience about investing in design when you don't have designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Resources&lt;/h5&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Design systems evolved the process by which UI graphics are made, full with automation and deep integration. However, Open Source communities were left out of this bandwagon as most of the applications providing these capabilities were for pay or very limited for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a new wave of design system applications, led by PenPot, has made an appearance with a bold strategy and Open Source at its core.
As such, KDE Plasma saw an opportunity to build something unique to develop the Plasma desktop faster and with higher fidelity to user experience standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the talk about the journey and current state of implementation at the KDE Plasma Deskop. In this talk we discuss graphics, colors, typography, graphical components and much more. How the journey took us from a limited application for pay to a fully Open Source system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source thrives on contributions from developers, testers, and community builders, but design often gets left behind. With far fewer dedicated designers in FOSS than in the commercial tech world, usability issues go unaddressed, and end users feel the friction. The good news: you don’t need a design degree or a new job title to make a difference. In this talk, I’ll show how any contributor can use simple, practical design methods to identify and solve UX issues in their favorite open source projects. I’ll try to break down “design” into simple steps anyone can try, noticing where people get stuck, asking the right questions, sketching ideas on paper, and trying them out with friends or community members. No special skills or software needed: just curiosity and a willingness to make things easier for others. If you’ve ever thought, “I see the problem, but I’m not a designer” - this talk will give you the mindset and tools to step up and become one.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Understanding your users should be an important step of software development. In recent years, many end-user facing FLOSS communities integrated at least some aspects of design into their development. Unfortunately, most developer-centric projects still haven't started to even think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk concludes two years of user research in Forgejo, a Git-backed software forge and collaboration platform. Forgejo can be self-hosted or used on a public instance like Codeberg.org to create software together, from sharing and reviewing code to tracking user problems, doing project management and doing design work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprise: False assumptions we made about our users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge: Understanding complex and technical use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad-practices: Why "Feature Requests" and the common workflow to create software might actually be a terrible idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some ideas: Scaling user research beyond the team of one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk considers usage of eye trackers to track usability issues in FLOSS. The use of consumer-grade hardware eye trackers is considered for cases when there is an SDK for Linux available, and when there is not. A webcam-based software eye tracking approach is considered as well and compared with hardware eye tracking using illustrative examples. Visualization of short-term and long-term eye tracking data series is explained with sample code for Graphviz and GNU Octave. Examples of eye tracking heatmaps and their usage scenarios are discussed, as well as using mouse heatmaps as supplementary data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Crystal focuses on developer happiness while still providing strong safety guarantees. It goes to great lengths to make complex concepts easy to use, taking away a lot of complexity. For example, static typing and compilation to native code make it intrinsically type safe and blazingly fast. Yet built-in type inference makes most type annotations unnecessary, resulting in easy to read and clean code. It feels like a dynamic language.
Crystal’s runtime allows the programmer to write I/O operations as if they were blocking, but they're actually non-blocking under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Building a minimal cross-platform terminal UI library</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Terminal UI libraries often rely on heavy dependencies (e.g., curses) or platform-specific hacks. Lua’s minimal standard library makes this even harder—how can we provide a portable, lightweight solution? In this talk we’ll explore terminal.lua (built on top of luasystem): a minimal, cross-platform terminal UI library for Lua designed to provide essential terminal primitives without external dependencies like curses. The work presented here includes developments made during its participation in GSoC 2025, as well as improvements made afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lua intentionally keeps its standard library small, so handling terminals requires defining the true minimum set of capabilities needed for Unix, macOS, and Windows — while keeping the API simple, consistent, and predictable. The talk begins by outlining the problem: how to handle terminals portably and transparently in a lightweight language by creating a level playing field. We’ll then walk through the minimal core implemented in luasystem and how terminal.lua builds a higher-level layer on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging differences between Unix/POSIX and Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTF-8/Unicode handling (including double-width characters such as emojis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-blocking async keyboard input in single-threaded Lua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Querying the terminal (e.g., retrieving cursor position)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Representing terminal state (color, cursor position/shape/visibility)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic layouting and color handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem"&gt;LuaSystem&lt;/a&gt; — a C library exposing the absolute bare minimum terminal and system primitives needed to let Lua build a UI layer on top: https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lunarmodules/terminal.lua"&gt;terminal.lua&lt;/a&gt; — the “proof of the pudding”: a pure-Lua UI library that demonstrates what can be built cleanly and portably when sticking to those minimal primitives: https://github.com/lunarmodules/terminal.lua&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLUE&lt;/strong&gt; is an acronym for &lt;strong&gt;Build Language User Extensible&lt;/strong&gt;.  It is a functional declarative build-system fully written in Guile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to other build-systems, BLUE works as a library that can be used by projects to manage their builds.  It is entirely self-contained and &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be embedded into existing projects.  It provides an optional clean and extensible CLI and extension points for external tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLUE aims to reduce frictions from the build-system by providing a rich extensible API with clear error messages and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what is so special about Lisp's REPLs? Curious how to debug your Guile project or write tests? Lost in all the tools and libraries and not sure which to use or how? We've got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we will go through the fundamental tools needed for efficient Guile development. This will work for your personal Guix config, Guix itself, a new fancy Guile library, or Your Next Big Thing. We will go step by step from a simple project stub to a fully functional application covered with tests, and along the way we will learn about:
- REPLs and highly interactive development environments
- Ares/Arei Guile IDE
- How to deal with exceptions and stack traces
- Testing in the Scheme ecosystem and a new testing library, suitbl
- Whether tests and TDD work with the REPL
- Whether you need a debugger and how to use it&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Those looking to get started with Scheme often find that they need to first learn Emacs. This is for good reason: pretty much all other editors have lacked the basic features to make Scheme a comfortable language to use. Over the past year, I've been developing my own VS Code extension to make programming Scheme without Emacs a reality. This talk explores what exists today, covering both my own extension, other tooling, and what's left for us to do as a community to make Scheme a first-class citizen in all editors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/andywingo/wastrel"&gt;Wastrel&lt;/a&gt; is a new ahead-of-time compiler from WebAssembly to native binaries.  It has all the features, tail calls, garbage collection (via &lt;a href="https://github.com/wingo/whippet"&gt;Whippet&lt;/a&gt;), and exception handling included.  In this talk we show how Wastrel can run on vanilla C programs compiled using the &lt;a href="https://wasi.dev/"&gt;WASI&lt;/a&gt; toolchain with best-in-class performance, as well as running Scheme programs compiled using &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/spritely/hoot"&gt;Hoot&lt;/a&gt;.  We discuss how Wastrel build on Hoot's WebAssembly support library and compare the speed of Scheme programs in the browser versus Wastrel versus native Guile.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"&gt;Lisp&lt;/a&gt; is often decried for being hard to read and having too little syntax. This talk argues that the parentheses are not the point, but the uniform structure is! Lisp is like clay: a medium which is versatile for building many shapes and sculpting beautiful new technical visions. Christine Lemmer-Webber makes an argument that lisp's power comes from composable DSLs, and that this power is what gives projects like &lt;a href="https://guix.gnu.org/"&gt;Guix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://spritely.institute/"&gt;Spritely&lt;/a&gt; much of their strength.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm that is most commonly used in interactive applications where imperative, event-driven, callback-laden code quickly becomes overwhelming and difficult to reason about. The reduction in cognitive overhead comes at a price, however. Popular reactive systems are limited to one-way data flow (a directed acyclic graph) which limits the types of problems these systems can solve elegantly. Fortunately, a way to remove this limitation has been known for over 15 years! Alexey Radul's 2009 PhD thesis "Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation" tells us how. In this talk, I'll use Guile Scheme to demonstrate how an FRP system built on the propagator model allows for cyclic dependencies without user-visible glitches whilst keeping implementation complexity low.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe work on creating and publishing Guix container images, and what you can do with them.  Images are bootstrapped from Debian images and built on GitLab shared runners for amd64 and arm64, with ppc64el and riscv64 work in progress. The images are tested for regression, and automatically uploaded to the GitLab container registry and to Docker Hub.  We will also talk about what these images can be used for, with examples of long-term reproducible tarball artifacts for official releases of GNU Libtasn1, InetUtils, Libidn2 and SASL. We will also go into limitations involving security trade-offs for reducing guix-daemon privileges, and the interaction between GitLab shared runners, user namespaces and other security complications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Implementing Block-Max Pruning in Rust: Faster Learned Sparse Retrieval for Modern Search</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learned sparse retrieval models such as SPLADE, uniCOIL, and other transformer-based sparse encoders have become popular for delivering neural-level relevance while preserving the efficiency of inverted indexes. But these models also produce indexes with statistical properties radically different from classic BM25: longer queries, compressed vocabularies, and posting lists with unusual score distributions. As a result, traditional dynamic pruning algorithms like WAND and Block-Max WAND often fail to exploit their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents Block-Max Pruning (BMP) from a systems and Rust-engineering perspective. We will walk through how BMP restructures query processing by partitioning document space into small, contiguous blocks and maintaining lightweight, on-the-fly score upper bounds that guide safe or approximate early termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is aimed at developers building retrieval engines, Rust-based data systems, or ML-powered search pipelines who want to push sparse retrieval performance further.
Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how BMP works, why learned sparse models require new pruning strategies, and how to integrate these ideas into modern, high-performance Rust codebases.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What are multi-vector embeddings? How do they differ from regular embeddings? And how can you build an AI-powered OCR system in under 5 minutes without paying a fortune for infrastructure? If you're curious for answers, join me! I'll break down ColBERT embeddings, explore how MUVERA compression is revolutionizing the way we work with multi-vectors, and show you how to leverage it all to build an AI-powered OCR system on resource constrained devices such as Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Traditional QA pipelines—even those using baseline RAG—struggle with complex reasoning tasks such as multi-hop inference, contradiction detection, entity linking, temporal consistency, and large-scale cross-document understanding. These limitations become critical in domains like investigative journalism, scientific research, and legal analysis, where answers depend on relationships spread across many documents rather than isolated text chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will demonstrate how open-source knowledge-graph–based approaches can overcome these challenges by enabling structured retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, richer context assembly, and corpus-level summarization. We will explore several open-source frameworks used today to build graph-enhanced RAG systems and compare them across practical criteria: extraction quality, response latency, hardware requirements, maintenance complexity, and suitability for different problem types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with a clear, practical understanding of how to select and apply graph-based RAG techniques to extract deeper insight from large unstructured datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks we're going to consider:

- LlamaIndex KG (MIT license) - https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index
- KAG/OpenSPG (Apache-2.0 license) - https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Search in Elasticsearch keeps evolving, from traditional BM25 keyword retrieval to multi-stage search that combine lexical, vector, and language-model-driven intelligence. In this talk, we’ll explore how Elasticsearch APIs enable developers to build hybrid search systems that mix classical scoring, dense vector search and semantic reranking in a single coherent workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use ES|QL, Elasticsearch’s new query language, and show how constructs like FORK, FUSE, RERANK, COMPLETION, and full-text functions let you build multi-stage pipelines in a simple query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll discuss where ML models and LLMs fit into the retrieval stack, from embedding generation to on-the-fly augmentation and semantic rerankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll look at future directions for search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a practical and forward-looking view of how search is evolving in Elasticsearch—and how to put multi-stage retrieval to work—this session is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Meilisearch (https://www.meilisearch.com/) is a popular Open-Source search engine written in Rust that boasts more than 50k stars on GitHub, focusing on performance and ease-of-use.
Meilisearch is designed to be available worldwide, which requires supporting multiple languages through word tokenization. But, how difficult is it to segment and normalize words? And, how different this process can be depending on the Language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meilisearch core maintainers share how they handled language support, the difficulties they faced, and the solution they found.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenSearch v3 major release that was introduced in the past year represents a significant leap forward in open source search technology, delivering breakthrough innovations across neural search, AI-driven search experiences and performance optimization. This talk explores the major features that define the 3.x releases and their impact on modern search applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll dive into differentiating capabilities like scalable Neural Sparse ANN Search using the SEISMIC algorithm, and the new Search Relevance Workbench for metric-driven relevance evaluation. Discover how system-generated Search Pipelines eliminate configuration overhead, automatically building Vector Search pipelines at query runtime and UI editor for AI Search workflow set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release brings industry-standard search features including MMR, ColBERT’s late interaction, RRF, radial search, and one of the most popular pre-trained spare encoder model in HuggingFace positioning OpenSearch alongside leading search platforms. Performance innovations deliver dramatic improvements: Memory-Optimized and Disk-based Vector Search with efficient FAISS execution, star-tree indexes for multi-field aggregations, 2x storage savings through derived source, and reader/writer separation for independent index/search scaling and resiliency. Real-time data processing enables continuous query execution for streaming results, and ability to build vector indices remotely using GPUs, while QueryInsights helps monitor cluster’s search query performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll showcase Agentic Search capabilities—from Natural Language Agent Search to native AI agents with persistent memory, workflow UI editors for non-technical users to set up AI Search flows, and OpenSearch MCP integration with Claude code, Gemini CLI and other AI assistants to interact with OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your opportunity to hear from the OpenSearch maintainers and ambassadors about the latest and greatest in the project. Attendees will leave understanding how OpenSearch v3 addresses the full spectrum of modern search challenges: Neural and Vector Search, Search quality measurement, performance at scale, and the future of AI-powered Search experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) in Go: current state and challenges</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) is a well-known compiler optimization technique that brings runtime statistics about how an application is executed to the Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation model, which is quite recently added to the Go compiler. However, this technique is not widely used nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I want to discuss the current PGO state in the Go ecosystem. During my work on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/zamazan4ik/awesome-pgo"&gt;Awesome PGO&lt;/a&gt; project, I gathered a lot of interesting data points and insights about various PGO issues and discussed many related quirks with different stakeholders like end-users, maintainers, and application developers. We will talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PGO state across Go compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PGO awareness across the Go industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PGO tooling issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengths and weaknesses of PGO modes for different use cases in real-world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top blockers for PGO adoption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And many other things!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that after the talk more people will be aware of PGO, aware of usual PGO blockers, and know more about how to avoid these limitations in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Go’s runtime has always prided itself on efficient, low-latency garbage collection. But modern hardware brings new challenges. More cores, bigger caches, and heavier workloads. In this talk, we’ll start by exploring how Go’s current garbage collector and memory allocator work together to manage memory. Then we’ll dive into the new GreenTea GC, an experimental redesign that cleans memory in groups (“spans”) instead of object-by-object. You’ll learn how it works, why it matters, and what this “span-based” approach could mean for your Go programs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be exploring the Go source code: https://go.dev&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reflection is a form of metaprogramming that often feels like magic — letting you inspect and manipulate your code at runtime. But there's no magic here at all — just clever engineering that makes your programs simpler and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll take a look at how reflection actually works under the hood in Go. We'll explore how types and values are represented at runtime, what really happens when you call &lt;code&gt;reflect.ValueOf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;reflect.TypeOf&lt;/code&gt;, and how the compiler keeps this dynamic capability simple, yet powerful in its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, reflection will look a little less mysterious — and a lot more elegant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Understanding Why Your CPU is Slow: Hardware Performance Insights with perf-go</title>

        <abstract>&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go's pprof tells you &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; your CPU time is spent, but not &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the CPU is slow. Is it cache misses? Branch mispredictions? These hardware-level performance characteristics are invisible to pprof but critical for optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perf-go bridges this gap by leveraging Linux's &lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt; tool and CPU Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs) to expose hardware performance counters for Go programs. It translates perf's low-level observations into pprof's familiar format, giving Go developers hardware insights without leaving their existing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What You'll Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll:
- Demonstrate the limitations of pprof for understanding performance bottlenecks
- Show how perf-go exposes CPU cache behaviour, branch prediction, and memory access patterns
- Walk through real benchmarks where we identify and fix cache-line contention issues
- Explore how hardware counters can guide improvements that pprof alone wouldn't reveal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go developers who want to optimise performance-critical code and understand the "why" behind their bottlenecks. Basic familiarity with profiling concepts helpful but not required.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Go 1.25 introduced &lt;code&gt;testing/synctest&lt;/code&gt;, a package that brings deterministic scheduling and control over concurrency during tests. For developers who struggle with flaky tests, hidden data races, or hard-to-reproduce timing issues, synctest offers a powerful solution: it lets you run concurrent code in a bubble, so you can efficiently explore interleavings, force edge cases, and prove correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll explore the motivation behind synctest, and dive into the testing patterns it enables. We’ll walk through practical examples of converting existing tests to use synctest. The session includes a demo illustrating how synctest can turn an intermittently failing test into a deterministic one, and surface bugs that traditional tests might miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you build concurrent systems, maintain production Go services, or simply want more reliable tests, this talk will give you a solid understanding of what synctest brings to Go—and how you can start using it today.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source is under attack.
Most notably the xz/liblzma backdoor incident (CVE-2024-3094) has shown how even trusted and widely adopted libraries can be compromised.
Also, since February 2025, the Go language community has been observing an enormous amount of malicious Go modules being published with fake GitHub stars and very plausible contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session introduces gomodjail, an experimental tool that “jails” Go modules by applying syscall restrictions using seccomp and symbol tables, so as to mitigate potential supply chain attacks and other vulnerabilities.
In other words, gomodjail provides a "container" engine for Go modules but in finer granularity than Docker containers, FreeBSD jails, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gomodjail focuses on simplicity; a security policy for gomodjail can be applied just by adding &lt;code&gt;// gomodjail:confined&lt;/code&gt; comment to the &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file of the target program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session will discuss its design, implementation details, limitations (e.g., support for modules that use "unsafe" pointers or reflections), and the plan to improve its robustness and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;File uploads are a ubiquitous and fundamental part of modern applications. While simple at first, they become increasingly challenging as file sizes grow. Users expect reliable data transfers, even when uploading multi-gigabyte files over unreliable mobile networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional file uploads over HTTP fail unrecoverably when the underlying connection is interrupted. Resumable uploads, on the other hand, allow an application to continue uploading a file exactly where it left off. This preserves previously transferred data and greatly improves the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd"&gt;Tusd&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source file-upload server written in Go that makes it easy to add resumable uploads to any application - even those written in languages other than Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores why Go is a natural fit for such use cases. In particular, we dive into how contexts help coordinate concurrent, long-running HTTP requests, how the net/http package provides fine-grained control over request handling, and how Go’s tooling assists in testing various failure scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk explores how to bridge sqlc’s type-safe database layer with a clean, domain-driven service architecture using Crush/OpenCode — an open source code generator written in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sqlc generates strongly typed database access, but using its structs directly can couple business logic to schema details. Crush/OpenCode automates the creation of repository layers that work with domain entities instead, orchestrating transactions while preserving compile-time safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built entirely in Go, Crush/OpenCode uses Ollama and the gpt-oss model for “augmented generation,” guided by reference implementations to keep the produced code consistent and idiomatic. It also generates tests first, using testify/suite, Testcontainers-Go, gofakeit, and go-cmp, then refines repositories until tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a practical Go-based workflow that reduces boilerplate, ensures consistency across repositories, and demonstrates how open source LLM tooling can enhance real-world Go development — without sacrificing simplicity or type safety.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Zero-touch observability for Go is finally becoming real. In this talk, we’ll walk through the different strategies you can use to instrument Go applications &lt;strong&gt;without changing a single line of code&lt;/strong&gt;, and what they cost you in terms of overhead, stability, and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll compare several concrete approaches and projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBPF-based auto-instrumentation&lt;/strong&gt;, using OpenTelemetry’s Go auto-instrumentation agent:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation"&gt;https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/"&gt;https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compile-time manipulation&lt;/strong&gt;, using tools that rewrite or augment Go binaries at build time, such as:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/alibaba/opentelemetry-go-auto-instrumentation"&gt;https://github.com/alibaba/opentelemetry-go-auto-instrumentation&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime techniques&lt;/strong&gt;, including agents, shared-library injection, and binary trampolines, as used in OpenTelemetry’s Go “Autosdk” work:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/go/autosdk/"&gt;https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/go/autosdk/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USDT (User Statically-Defined Tracing) probes&lt;/strong&gt;, exploring how to add or generate USDT probe points for Go services (at build time or via injection) so that external tooling (eBPF, DTrace-style tools, etc.) can consume high-level events without source changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond what exists today, we’ll look at how ongoing work in the Go runtime and diagnostics ecosystem could unlock cleaner, safer hooks for future auto-instrumentation, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;runtime/trace&lt;/code&gt; and diagnostics primitives:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/trace"&gt;https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/trace&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Proposals such as Go “flight recording” (Issue #63185):  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the talk, we’ll use &lt;strong&gt;benchmark results and small, realistic services&lt;/strong&gt; to compare these strategies along three axes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance overhead (latency, allocations, CPU impact)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robustness and upgradeability across Go versions and container images  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operational friction: rollout complexity, debugging, and failure modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with a clear mental model of &lt;strong&gt;when to choose eBPF, compile-time rewriting, runtime injection, or USDT-based approaches&lt;/strong&gt;, how OpenTelemetry’s Go auto-instrumentation fits into that picture, and where upcoming runtime features might take us next. The focus is strongly practical and open-source: everything shown will be reproducible using publicly available tooling in the Go and OpenTelemetry ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This session will explore the development of GoDoctor, a Model Context Protocol server designed to improve the experience of coding with AI agents. This is not a product presentation, GoDoctor is actually a playground to test different types of tools applied to coding with LLMs, and in this talk I will focus on the different experiments I made and reporting on both successes and failures. The ultimate goal is to understand what works and what doesn’t for improving code generation for Go projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Developing Go for micocontrollers with 32kB of RAM requires a big shift in thinking, moreso if you are trying to get a complete networking stack with Ethernet, TCP/IP, HTTP to run on said device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past years we've learned how to minimize memory usage and make programs run performantly on these small devices by adopting patterns common in the embedded industry, some of which make working with Go a even better experience than the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the tried and tested "Embedded Go" programming patterns we've found to work and make developing in Go a pleasure, no matter the hardware context:
- Avoiding pointers to structs within structs: rethinking the Configure() method
- Zero-value programming
- Eliminating heap allocations during runtime
- Reusing slice capacity
    - Bounded memory growth on your program
    - Safe pointer-to-slice with generational index handles&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Modularizing a 10-Year Monolith: The Architecture, The People, and the Pain</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="go">Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most Go codebases begin as straightforward layered monoliths, but years of growth often turn those layers into a web of hidden coupling and hard-to-predict side effects. Rewrites promise a clean slate but rarely succeed in practice. What the Go community lacks are real examples of large open source Go projects that have completed a transition to a modular monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the first major open source Go project undergoing this evolution. It covers how we are moving from a decade-old layered architecture to a modular design while continuing to ship features to hundreds of production environments. This is not theory. This is architectural change in a live system with real contributors, long CI pipelines, and legacy assumptions embedded throughout the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see practical strategies for decoupling features, aligning code boundaries with product teams, introducing modular service packages, and modifying database schemas without slowing ongoing development. We walk through the familiar pain points in large Go monoliths, including tight coupling, long test cycles, and frequent merge conflicts, and show how steady incremental refactoring creates a stronger and more adaptable architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are working on a fast-growing Go project or maintaining a mature production system, you will leave with clear and concrete techniques to modernize your architecture safely and sustainably, all without stopping feature work or risking a disruptive rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, model trains were a popular hobby. Thanks to low production costs, anyone could afford a small HO gauge layout. The system was simple: a train, a motor, 12V DC in the track, and off you go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years later, we took our trains out of the attic with a big idea in mind: to convert them to digital. With some Seeed Studio, Bluetooth, and TinyGo, we managed to get a functional railway network, were we can manage speed, direction, and lights of each train individually.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>There are No Adults in the Room: Learning how to Grow Up as a Team</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happens when your project grows up faster than you do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of the FOSS world allow for young and passionate developers to make real, lasting contributions; sometimes in places where they would otherwise never be taken seriously. As &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/26/rolling_rhino_reboot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; put it&lt;/a&gt;, Rhino Linux was started by a "&lt;em&gt;teen dream team&lt;/em&gt;". We had a bold, fast-paced start that threw us headfirst into the world of Linux maintainership. But while we shared the common goal of 'growing and improving' the distribution, our individual visions often diverged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being taken seriously has its burdens, too. It's easy to get in over your head - to lose direction, burn out, or stop communicating altogether - especially when there are no adults in the room to offer guidance. We banded together by chance, and had to discover our own limits through trial and error. Saying '&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;' isn't easy, especially under the internal pressure to keep delivering at a steady pace, when everyone is deeply passionate about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSS is no stranger to ever-shifting team dynamics, or to developers biting off more than they can chew; challenges that are only accentuated when all involved are still growing up. It's easy to lose sight of when to step back, and when to recognize the need to scale. As we have come to learn, if you want to be a systems maintainer, you need to maintain your own systems, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us as we retrace the human side of &lt;a href="https://rhinolinux.org"&gt;Rhino Linux&lt;/a&gt; - how we learned to build a team as young developers, what this project taught us about maturity, communication, and sustainability, and the lessons we hope others like us can take from our journey.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Accessible Sovereignty: Why the Four Freedoms Depend on Inclusion</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The four essential freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation — freedom 0: the freedom to run the software; freedom 1: the freedom to study and change it; freedom 2: the freedom to redistribute; freedom 3: the freedom to distribute modified versions — are widely cited as the foundation of free software.  ￼https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does “freedom” mean when people with disabilities cannot meaningfully use, extend, and share software? Digital sovereignty is hollow unless the tools and communities respect accessibility. If a user interface or workflow excludes a segment of users, then the right to “run” or “modify” the software is in practice restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk argues that accessibility (in code, UI, documentation, communities) is not an optional add-on — it is essential for the exercise of the four freedoms, and thus for true digital sovereignty. We will explore how CMS projects can embed accessibility into their governance, workflows and contributions so that every user can exercise the freedoms of use, study, share and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is great to see GitHub making significant efforts to improve their accessibility, and that of the tools that they give to the community. https://accessibility.github.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/our-pledge-to-help-improve-the-accessibility-of-open-source-software-at-scale/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover:
    •   How exclusion of users with disabilities limits freedom of software use and modification.
    •   The link between accessibility and community inclusivity: if you cannot participate fully, you cannot help shape the software.
    •   Practical steps for CMS ecosystems (Drupal, WordPress, etc) to make accessibility a governance norm rather than a compliance afterthought.
    •   A call to action: build tools, policies and default workflows so that accessibility becomes part of the infrastructure of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source communities thrive when every contributors can participate fully and safely. Neurodivergent contributors bring unique strengths such as pattern detection, hyperfocus, creativity, and non-linear problem-solving. But they also face invisible barriers that can limit their access and growth.
This talk explores practical scenarios for fostering neuroinclusive communities from onboarding and mentorship to culture-building and leadership. Attendees will leave with lessons they can apply in their teams, projects, and meetups and welcome every mind within their communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, a number of open source companies have attracted significant attention after announcing license changes. Not surprisingly, these shifts sparked backlash from open source enthusiasts, prompting some to create community-driven forks under open source foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is growing skepticism toward (single) company backed open source projects, with many arguing that open source projects should be run by neutral foundations to prevent future bait-and-switch tactics. But is foundation backing really the answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on over a decade of experience in both open source foundations and companies, Fatih and Ray will compare foundation-backed and company-backed projects across key areas such as governance, roadmap planning, community, and funding. They’ll explore real-world examples of successful—and not-so-successful—projects in both models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Fatih and Ray will discuss why funding models should be just one of several factors in assessing the long-term viability of open source projects. They’ll offer a holistic approach for evaluating open source projects, helping developers and decision-makers make informed choices about which projects to adopt, support, or contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ten years, 1,600 release votes, and a clear lesson: open collaboration works. Discover how Apache Incubator projects turned release reviews from rule-checking into mentoring, and what this decade of data reveals about building healthier open source communities.
Description: What can we learn from a decade of release votes in open source communities? From 2015 to 2025, over 1,600 Apache Incubator release vote threads showed how project collaboration and growth have changed.
In this talk, I’ll share practical lessons from analysing votes across more than 160 projects. You’ll see how better documentation, mentoring, and automation changed a stressful compliance process into a positive learning experience.
You’ll learn about the changes: fewer rejections, quicker reviews, and a shift from a strict to a more collaborative tone. I’ll also discuss how release cadence reflects community health and what early warning signs to watch for before a project slows down.
Whether you’re a maintainer, mentor, or contributor, you’ll come away with ideas to improve release workflows and help build stronger, more confident communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As open source became mainstream, companies started to allow or even encourage their employees to get involved upstream and even started to open source their projects. Having more people being paid to work on open source software sounds great at first. However, when people don’t get the education and support to integrate upstream work and mindset into their daily work the open source projects, and eventually the boarder ecosystem, suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon affects everyone from single-vendor projects to diverse communities, and from small projects to large communities, and eventually contributes to maintainer shortage and burnout. Addressing this is the responsibility of both individuals and corporations. So, where should they start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will outline the different ways how corporate mindset and priorities harm open source projects today, including tasks and responsibilities in open source projects that fall short and obstacles that maintainers face on a daily basis. Attendees will learn what individuals can do to improve their own and their communities’ experience. Last, but not least, the talk will provide tools to educate employers about why and how maintaining key open source dependencies is strategic for a successful business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The CRA isn't coming for your open source community</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many open source contributors, maintainers, and communities are anxious about the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its potential impact on open source. It’s easy to feel that these obligations aimed at commercial vendors will somehow end up falling on volunteer maintainers, community projects, and the broader open source ecosystem. But that's not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to strong, coordinated advocacy from the community, the European Commission actually understands the open source ecosystem far better than many believe. The CRA not only clarifies where responsibility lies—squarely on the vendors who profit from open-source components, as it should—but also introduces meaningful tools to improve sustainability, including the new attestation program, which has real potential to channel support back into the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-designed law, however, doesn’t mean there will be no impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on direct involvement in the CRA implementation process through the ORC WG and the CRA Expert Group, Tobie will walk through how these changes will affect open source communities in practice, why the underlying structure of the CRA makes sense, and how the open source communities can position themselves to benefit from it if they so wish to deliver more secure software more sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Synthetic Senior: Rethinking Free Software Mentorship in the AI Era</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AI-assisted contributors can now produce patches that appear senior at first glance: fast, polished, and surprisingly complex. But many of these contributions arrive without the context, intent, or architectural understanding that maintainers rely on during review. This emerging pattern — the rise of the “Synthetic Senior” — is reshaping expectations around mentorship, review culture, and long-term project sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintainers face a growing dilemma: welcoming new contributors while navigating an influx of high-volume, low-context PRs that demand deep review time. Traditional mentorship doesn't scale to this volume, and without new guardrails, it’s a recipe for burnout. While platforms, including GitHub, iterate on systemic solutions to filter this noise, communities need immediate, practical strategies to protect their maintainers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on discussions with seasoned maintainers and data from AI tooling pilots across open source foundations, this talk offers community-centered strategies for adapting to the AI era without losing what makes FOSS resilient. We’ll explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstrating comprehension:&lt;/strong&gt; Contribution workflows that encourage understanding rather than pure generation, helping contributors show they can maintain what they propose.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful friction:&lt;/strong&gt; How small, intentional barriers can surface genuine contributors and reduce maintainer fatigue.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-serve onboarding:&lt;/strong&gt; Using automation and pre-flight checks to move the first-pass review back to contributors.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy boundaries:&lt;/strong&gt; Re-establishing norms around closing contributions that lack necessary context, while keeping the door open for genuine contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session isn’t about banning AI. It is about building the guardrails that protect human mentorship and keep free software communities healthy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;No community grows in isolation. This talk explores how intentional partnerships can amplify the reach, visibility, and sustainability of open-source and developer communities. Drawing from experience building collaborations for community-driven tech initiatives and contributing to Mautic, I’ll share how to design partnership models that are mutually beneficial, helping communities gain resources, new contributors, and event support while offering partners authentic engagement aligned with FOSS principles. Attendees will walk away with a framework for identifying, pitching, and maintaining partnerships that strengthen both community and corporate allies without compromising values.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Has the once vibrant and much-loved cloud-native community lost its spark?
What was once an ecosystem fueled by collaboration and curiosity now feels increasingly defined by Slack channels, swag drops, and conference booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an explosion of meetups, and events, audiences are thinning. Community fatigue is real and vendor influence often overshadows genuine grassroots participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribution activity has slowed, and several once-thriving open-source projects are experiencing a contributor drought. End-user organizations and sponsors that once championed community contributions are now scaling back, leaving critical projects struggling to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk takes a candid look at the past, present, and possible future of the open source community. Through data and insights from a few popular OSS projects we’ll explore the patterns behind this shift and what it means for the sustainability of open collaboration in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Headscale &amp; Tailscale: The complementary open source clone</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Headscale began as a learning project to work out “what was needed” to re-implement a Tailscale control server and unexpectedly exploded in popularity in the self-hosted and open source community as a home-labbers alternative to Tailscale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headscale has a vibrant community, about 6000 members in our Discord community and our Github repo has more stars than Tailscale’s open source client, but who's counting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I was hired as a member of technical staff at Tailscale, spending half of my time contributing and driving Headscale, ensuring the future of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headscale is a clone of Tailscale’s closed-source SaaS control plane, and it would be easy to consider it a competitor. Tailscale supporting Headscale this way is an unusual arrangement and sometimes raises eyebrows with "the internet". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that letting Headscale be autonomous and trusting it to run its own community complements Tailscale in a variety of ways. It helps people stay in the ecosystem. Homelabbers and self-hosted will use it at home, but bring Tailscale to work. Sometimes it even solves problems Tailscale can not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it has not only been smooth sailing, and being a paid contributor has caused a lot of skepticism with some users fearing an “embrace, extend, extinguish” strategy, fueling conspiracy theories about our roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share how the projects exist in symbiosis, the challenges of being a paid contributor, and how the stability of a corporate payroll has enabled Headscale to reach its current scale.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Before April 2014, &lt;a href="https://openssl-library.org/"&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; was a backwater open source project with fewer than 10 regular contributors and 1 1/2 maintainers. Meanwhile its code had become a pillar of secure communication and data privacy in the industry. This was an unstable situation that was exposed when the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed"&gt;Heartbleed bug&lt;/a&gt; became global news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the OpenSSL project responded to this crisis was informed by the principles of open source. Jon Ericson, the Community Manager for the &lt;a href="https://openssl-foundation.org/"&gt;OpenSSL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, explains how a security bug ignited community growth and how the open source community provides ongoing stability to the OpenSSL project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nearly every tech event has a Code of Conduct these days, but too often it’s treated as boilerplate, or as a box to tick. But what happens when someone breaks it? Like incident response, success depends on rehearsal, not documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll share practical lessons from over a decade of experience running events like DevOpsDays, Cloud Native Days and PostgreSQL conferences. How to set the stage for a safe event, talk through potential incidents, and what conversations will need to be had with different stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it’s hard to build trust, but easy to lose trust. We will cover how to openly and iteratively develop your community’s Code of Conduct.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://allcontributors.org/"&gt;All Contributors&lt;/a&gt; is a project which helps us recognise all the types of contributions that build our open source communities and make them flourish. It defines a specification for acknowledging community members' work, whatever they contribute, as well as tools for easy management and presentation of this information. All Contributors is used by a wide range of communities, particularly those where key contributors are not well recognised by metrics more easily extracted from version control history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently these communities noticed signs of poor health in All Contributors. When the website went offline, a group of users were &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4245"&gt;catalysed in to action&lt;/a&gt;. Coordinated by &lt;a href="https://www.leahwasser.com/"&gt;Leah Wasser&lt;/a&gt; (pyOpenSci Executive Director &amp;amp; Founder, PSF Fellow) they committed to adopting the project and forming a new, sustainable team of maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the context of All Contributors, I will tell a story of the decline and rise of an open source project. There will be a scattering of challenges maintainers face such as, burnout, technical debt, and lottery factor. However, it is also a hopeful story about how open source software can play critical roles, cultivate deep affection from its users, and, with community support, rise again.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source is suffering from its own success. Our community solved problems with minimal attention from the rest of the world for almost 30 years, slowly becoming the foundation of nearly every piece of software critical to everyday life. Now with increasing regulation around the world, evolving cybersecurity requirements, and changing corporate participation and funding, how do we ensure the ecosystem's continued success? The things that have worked for the first decades will not be the things that keep us going. We will look at sustainability not only as a funding problem, but also from the perspectives of global policy movement, security, and other intertwined issues that face open source in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I'm a psychology researcher that has been moved by the extent of burnout in Open Source, and I've written what I believe to be the most comprehensive report to date on burnout among OSS developers. I reviewed the academic literature, conducted a qualitative analysis of online discussion in the OSS community, and interviewed OSS developers. I identified 6 factors that contribute to developer burnout: difficulty getting paid, workload and time commitment, maintenance work as unrewarding, toxic community behaviour, hyper-responsibility and pressure to prove oneself. I recommend 4 structural changes to address developer burnout: pay OSS developers, foster a culture of recognition and respect, grow the community and advocate for maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source communities depend on a steady influx of newcomers who ask questions, seek help, and build relationships. Future heroes have to start somewhere as newbies. But across the ecosystem, those early engagement signals are dropping—sometimes sharply. Generative AI is changing how people learn, troubleshoot, and participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk synthesizes new research and real-world data to explore how AI is reshaping contributor pipelines—and what open source projects can do to adapt before downstream participation suffers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When a Python program crashes, a backtrace is printed — often enough to pinpoint and fix the issue.
When a C or C++ program crashes on an embedded Linux system, however, nothing appears by default — except perhaps the dreaded “Segmentation fault” message. Unfortunately, there’s no simple --enable-backtrace option to enable human-readable backtraces at build time. Even worse, generating useful backtraces involves many subtle factors, and there’s no comprehensive resource that explains how to get them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of clear information arises because backtraces depend on numerous variables: your hardware architecture, operating system, distribution, compiler, build configuration, and the specific tools used to unwind the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll demystify how backtraces actually work and explore the key concepts behind them. I’ll also show how to leverage libunwind and minidebuginfo to obtain reliable backtraces on ARMv7 and ARMv8 systems, within the context of a Yocto-based embedded Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rust is rapidly reshaping how we build reliable software — including in areas once dominated by C. But what does it really look like to bring Rust into an existing embedded codebase? This talk shares the hands-on experience of migrating a working ESP32 firmware from C to no_std Rust, highlighting what Rust changes, what it improves, and where the bumps in the road are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from a hobby project — a wireless arcade button used in a multiplayer blind test game (https://github.com/neon-beat) — we will explore the practical steps of developing Rust firmware on the ESP32, from toolchain setup and hardware abstraction to system architecture and debugging strategies. Along the way, we’ll discuss the key differences from traditional Rust development, the challenges faced in a no_std environment, and how the embedded Rust ecosystem and community helped the project move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re an embedded developer curious about Rust, someone evaluating the risks and benefits of adopting it in production, or simply interested in real-world migration stories, this talk aims to provide actionable insights, lessons learned, and a realistic view of what transitioning from C to Rust on micro controllers really looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ariel OS is a new RTOS for microcontrollers written fully in Rust. It supports popular hardware architectures (Cortex-M, ESP, RISC-V) and popular boards from vendors such as Espressif, Nordic, Raspberry Pi and ST. Ariel OS is built on top of Embassy and the embedded-hal traits, adding various OS functionalities and a multi-core capable scheduler. Ariel OS further aims to integrate the best of the available embedded Rust ecosystem to provide a seamless, batteries-included experience for microcontroller firmware development. Ariel OS is open source with dual Apache 2.0 / MIT license, available on GitHub&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we demonstrate how easy it is to use Ariel OS on microcontroller-based hardware and how the different features help to quickly get a project up and running. We overview the OS and walk through creating a firmware for a common board, thus showcasing the features that make Ariel OS development unique and appealing&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What happens when you mix German luxury engineering with a bit of DIY spirit? You get the world’s most over-engineered office chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk dives inside a BMW comfort seat — so when you get home in your 7-series, you can feel right at home in the same seat at your desk. Packed with ECUs, motors, pumps, heaters, ambient lighting and airbags, we’ll explore how it all works, how the seat communicates over CAN, j1850 CRCs, some quirks, and how an ESP32 can take control of everything from massage and lumbar support to heating and cooling, obviously all hooked up to homeassistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this talk will inspire others to reuse car parts in interesting and wonderful ways. We'll also discuss slightly easier things like integrating an idrive controller or gearshifter which are much more common but rarely explained in detail how and why they work the way they do compared to a more complex device like a seat.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Secure-boot projects often end up with a zoo of nearly-identical bootloader images for development, factory, and field use with each variant adding more risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This showcase illustrates how to avoid this entirely: one bootloader image that adapts securely to each lifecycle stage using fuse-based state transitions, device-bound unlock tokens, and policy-driven access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With barebox and OP-TEE, we’ll show how these mechanisms enforce secure operation while still allowing controlled debugging and recovery, without ever maintaining multiple images.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Contemporary embedded SoCs increasingly act as a network of specialized CPU cores, some dedicated to user applications, other dedicated to real time tasks, others to security. All those cores still share one set of critical peripherals, which require resource access coordination. This is increasingly implemented by making all cores talk to a dedicated core called SCP, the System Control Processor, using SCMI protocol. The SCP is responsible for coordinating access to critical resources, clock, reset, power domain, and so on. An open source firmware, SCP-firmware, can be used on the SCP to offer the SCMI services. This talk explains how to implement a port of SCP-firmware to an SCP core, what is the architecture of SCP-firmware, its initialization process, its driver or module model, how the ordering of module start up is achieved, how to implement UART and mailbox driver modules, and finally how SCMI server services are bound to modules and exposed to other cores. This is illustrated by an example code from existing SCP-firmware port to contemporary SoC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Secure-boot chains in embedded systems have largely converged on common building blocks like FIT, dm-verity or UKIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootloader is anchored in hardware trust, then verifies an operating system image, and the chain continues, eventually covering the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a gap when it comes to adding unit-specific bits of information, such as per-device configuration, hardware calibration, or MAC addresses needed early in boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this segment, I present the TLV framework recently added to the barebox bootloader, to which I contributed signature support. It allows device-specific key-value pairs to become part of the secure-boot chain from early on, providing the system with authenticated, replay-protected per-unit data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short presentation discusses
 - factory data and its relevance to a secure-boot chain
 - the barebox implementation using a signed Tag-Length-Value format
 - when and how to prevent interchange of TLV blobs across units
 - integration of the new feature&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most modern embedded SoCs provide a ROM-based recovery mechanism to bootstrap an unflashed device or revive a system whose bootloader has failed. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are typically vendor-specific, poorly documented, and supported only non-standard, sometimes closed, tools. Engineers end up juggling different utilities for each SoC family, with varying user interfaces and commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snagboot addresses this fragmentation. It is a vendor-agnostic, fully open-source recovery and reflashing tool written in Python, with support for TI, NXP, Microchip, ST, Broadcom, Amlogic, and Xilinx platforms (and Rockchip on the way). Through its components snagrecover, snagflash, and snagfactory, Snagboot offers a unified workflow for recovery, reflashing, and factory programming. This talk will give a concise introduction to how Snagboot works and where it fits in the bring-up and manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With embedded devices now everywhere, from home appliances to industrial systems, it is vital to regularly check them for CVEs so that any known vulnerabilities in software components can be identified and addressed before they lead to security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly monitoring these CVEs will be mandatory in various cases to comply with the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), which pushes the industry toward more accountable and proactive security in embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present &lt;strong&gt;sbom-cve-check&lt;/strong&gt;: a new automated vulnerability-analysis tool based on an SBOM, without requiring access to the original build systems. The SBOM is initially obtained from build systems such as Yocto or Buildroot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sbom-cve-check&lt;/strong&gt; supports SBOMs in SPDX2 or SPDX3 formats, and CycloneDX compatibility is planned. The tool aims to be an efficient replacement for the cve-check logic currently available in Yocto. It pulls from several databases, including NVD and the CVE List, and supports multiple annotation formats such as OpenVEX and Yocto’s custom format.
&lt;strong&gt;sbom-cve-check&lt;/strong&gt; currently supports the following export formats: SPDX3, CSV, and Yocto’s cve-check output format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is provided under the GPLv2 license, and contributions are of course welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year, Buildroot, the embedded Linux image build system, extended its Long-Term Support (LTS) release channel to three years, up from one year previously. This has been made possible through the Buildroot LTS Sponsorship program, which funds developer time for ongoing open-source maintenance rather than relying solely on maintainers' free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will walk through the Buildroot contribution and release process, and explain how LTS branches are maintained. We will discuss:
- When and why should you use a Buildroot LTS release ?
- What can you expect from LTS releases ?
- How the “LTS stewards” coordinate, analyze security issues and collaborate with upstream Buildroot maintainers
- The challenges and lessons learned during the first year of the program
- How to submit your contributions so they can be easily integrated in LTS releases
- Why should you or your company sponsor the LTS program ?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Beyond mobile use cases, flash control is increasingly important in industrial imaging applications. Precise timing is essential for tasks such as barcode scanning and machine vision. However, controlling camera flashes in embedded Linux systems has long been (and still is) a hardware-specific challenge that is often only supported by the downstream drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the current efforts to improve flash and strobe control in the Linux kernel, with a focus on the V4L2 subsystem. It begins with an overview of flash timing concepts and their key components, followed by an introduction to the existing V4L2 controls and the latest extensions under development. These enhancements aim to standardize flash behavior across platforms and pave the way for a clean and robust user-space integration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many recent Windows (on ARM and x86) laptops have replaced the standard UVC USB camera module with a raw MIPI camera-sensor using a CSI receiver and ISP in the CPU to process the raw data into an image (and on smartphones this has been the norm for ages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting these cameras under Linux is an ongoing challenge. At FOSDEM 2024 a solution using a software ISP running on the CPU was presented as a solution to get these cameras to work with a fully opensource stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at where we are at now, 2 years later, highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPU acceleration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOSS sensor calibration setup and color correction using CCMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lens shade correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux distributions shipping softISP MIPI camera support OOTB&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Raw to Real and Green to Great: Open Source Camera Tuning for Linux Devices with libcamera</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When you first power up a new camera sensor, the images often look green, noisy, and far from realistic. Getting from that raw output to a natural, high-quality image is a complex process known as camera tuning, and until recently, it’s been an opaque and proprietary part of the imaging pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the fundamentals of open source camera bring-up and tuning, using tooling provided by the libcamera project to illustrate the process. Through real examples, we’ll look at what early images from a new sensor look like, and how they improve through calibration and tuning steps. We’ll cover the basic equipment and workflow needed to get started, and highlight community efforts to create an open repository of tuning data for phones, laptops, tablets, and embedded libcamera powered Linux devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>No Line Like Mainline: Update On The Fully Mainline Software Stack For Rockchip SoCs</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Users wanting to run mainline Linux on ARM64 often face a familiar set of
trade-offs: the hardware is too expensive, hard to find, outdated, or doesn’t
support mainline at all. But this is starting to change, and Rockchip is one
of the SoC vendors hitting the sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out why Rockchip hardware, and Rockchip as a company, has been doing
particularly well when it comes to mainline Linux support. This talk provides
an overview of the available Rockchip hardware and the current state of the
mainline software landscape around them. We will then highlight what the
community has sucessfully upstreamed in 2025, and look at what's still
baking in the developers' ovens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk assumes the audience is already convinced that using the mainline 
kernel rather than vendor BSPs is the way to go. Beyond that, both veteran 
kernel hackers who are curious about hardware they're unfamiliar with, as well 
as people looking to get their feet wet in Linux kernel development, are welcome 
to attend.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the course of the past months, Michael has added or expanded support for new ARM and RISC-V boards to the Linux kernel (6.19+), to Yocto BSP layers and hopefully before FOSDEM 2026, to the U-Boot bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be much easier than expected, thanks to the availability of device drivers for most hardware blocks, and thanks to the possibility to reuse code (especially Device Tree) for already supported boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have hardware sitting idle or working suboptimally because of quick and dirty vendor kernels and BSPs, join this talk and learn how to let the mainline Linux kernel, U-Boot and appropriate Yocto Project layer fully support your board. This should enable other contributors to get involved, and  make it much easier for community projects to adopt such hardware too.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The embedded ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and keeping track of the most important developments has become increasingly difficult, especially outside of our current main interests. Over the past year,there have been important changes in the state of regulation, cryptography, tooling and software supply chain practices. In this talk, Marta will present a curated overview of the key trends that marked the year across both Linux and RTOS-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session will highlight the impact of the EU Cyber Resilience Act on embedded development, recent progress in post-quantum cryptography, the growing influence of AI-assisted tooling, and notable changes in compilers and hardening features. It will also cover the state of vulnerability reporting, examples of high-impact security issues affecting embedded systems, and the maintainership challenges that arise as long-standing maintainers get closer to reaching retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All topics will be supported with concrete references to articles, software releases and conference talks, giving attendees a clear and actionable picture of where embedded security is heading and what to pay attention to in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For those who care about software upgrades, Android phones have long been sold with two to three years of software support at best. This situation left a lot of devices running an out-of-date system, with the consequence of exposing users to security issues and premature obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation takes the case of the Google Pixel 4a (and a couple of other old Pixel phones) to discuss the issue and to show how it has been updated from Android 13 to Android 16 successfully, using Evolution X custom ROM project, thus extending the device lifetime beyond what was commercially offered by the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MicroPythonOS is the first modern graphical operating system that's addressing the need for a complete, out-of-the-box OS for resource-constrained hardware such as microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes heavy inspiration from Android and iOS, with an easy to use appstore, a beautiful LVGL-based touchscreen and button UI with lots of widgets, gestures, theme support, wifi manager and over-the-air updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software stack is fully open-source. This openness stands in contrast to the increasingly restrictive policies of traditional mobile ecosystems, which are increasingly becoming a walled-garden with tight controls on app distribution, content, and monetization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OS currently targets the ESP32 family, but it can run on anything that supports MicroPython, including the RP2350. It can also run as a regular desktop application, fullscreen or windowed, which makes app development super short cycle, and debugging much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware support currently includes WiFi, Bluetooth, many Intertial Measurement Units, Camera's, Touch Screens, IO Expanders, Displays, as well as low-level ADC pins, GPIO pins, I2C chips etc.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Bringing Decentralization to Your Doorstep: 5 Years in Browsers</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Can we make the web more decentralized and more private without asking users to switch browsers? For the past five years, the IPFS ecosystem has pioneered multiple approaches to this challenge. This talk shares hard-won lessons about what works—and what doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover three parallel strategies: (1) pushing for native protocol support in major browsers, (2) driving adoption of critical cryptographic building blocks (such as Ed25519 into WebCrypto API, a three-year standards journey led by Igalia that just succeeded in Chrome 137), and (3) using existing browser capabilities in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work emerged from IPFS's needs, but the benefits extend far beyond one protocol. Ed25519 in browsers now helps decentralized identity systems, local-first apps, and any protocol needing trustless verification — all without developers bundling their own cryptography libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be practical and honest: What takes three years versus three months? How do you fund unglamorous infrastructure work? When should you work around browser limitations versus push for standards changes? Attendees will leave with actionable insights for pushing privacy and decentralization into mainstream web infrastructure, plus a preview of what's coming next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The massive size of browser engines has concentrated power over the web platform into a few large corporations. Creating a new browser engine that is sufficiently featureful to be an alternative to the Big Three is practically impossible. But what if we could shrink the footprint of a browser's core? What if a browser was little more than a WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime and nearly everything else was an extension? By breaking up the monolith we would have a chance to re-decentralize control over the web. This talk will explore what a modular web platform might look like with Wasm at its core, with a focus on how Wasm GC enables the mission-critical feature of safely sharing resources amongst components.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>In defence of GnuPG: Key Sovereignty in an Age of Digital Feudalism</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="decentralized-internet-and-privacy">Decentralized Internet and Privacy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, critiques of OpenPGP and GnuPG have resurfaced in cycles: too complex, too fragile, too old, unfriendly, too “cryptonerd.” Modern messaging apps, "forward-secrecy-by-default" protocols, and crypto tools are frequently presented as decisive reasons to abandon GPG altogether. Yet these arguments often rely on a deeper and more troubling assumption: that ordinary users cannot and should not be expected to understand or control their own cryptographic identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk challenges that premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GnuPG is not merely another encryption tool; it is one of the few remaining technologies that give individuals total sovereign control over their cryptographic keys and consequently, over their digital identity. In an era increasingly shaped by "digital feudalism", where platforms dictate the limits of user agency under the guise of convenience, GPG represents a radically different model: federation instead of walled gardens, user-owned keys instead of opaque key escrow, and a trust model that distributes power horizontally rather than concentrating it in corporate or governmental authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation revisits the popular criticisms such as complexity, usability, lack of forward secrecy, the Web of Trust, aging cryptographic primitives and examines which reflect genuine limitations and which reflect a shift in cultural expectations shaped by centralized, app-centric design. It also highlights the unique strengths of GPG: asymmetric communication without a central provider, universal applicability far beyond email, a single identity usable across code-signing, backup encryption, SSH, authentication, and fully offline communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it explores the broader political and social context: why long term key ownership matters, why revocability and inspectability are essential freedoms, and why privacy cannot be sustainably outsourced to corporations whose incentives are misaligned with user autonomy. While modern protocols like Signal and Matrix bring important innovations, none yet replace the core promise of OpenPGP that cryptographic self determination remains possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk argues that dismissing GPG as "too hard" risks conceding our digital agency to systems designed to keep users passive. In a world where ideas outlive the apps that package them, GPG’s foundational idea (users should own their keys) remains not only relevant, but indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Public certificate authorities in TLS are a security liability from both a censorship and MITM perspective. Conceptually, DNSSEC's idea of tying PKI to domain names should be a better replacement -- except that in the DNS, relying on the names means trusting the registrars, registries, and ICANN. But what if we had &lt;em&gt;self-authenticating&lt;/em&gt; domain names? Could we build a PKI on top of those? Could such a PKI work with unmodified mainstream web browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and Tor Browser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done exactly that. Namecoin (a blockchain naming system providing the .bit TLD) and Tor (an anonymity network providing the .onion TLD) provide the self-authenticating domain names. This talk covers how we made the PKI. Topics to be discussed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why public certificate authorities are dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior work on using DNS as a PKI (and why it's less useful for us than you might think).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we creatively used API's to get mainstream TLS implementations to use Namecoin to validate TLS certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you might want to use TLS with Tor onion services (and why onion service encryption might not be as secure as you think).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we generalized Namecoin TLS to work with Tor onion services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we made TLS implementations that don't support Ed25519 work anyway with Tor onion services (which rely on Ed25519).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we can use TLS with Namecoin without putting a TLSA record on the blockchain (for better scalability).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Namecoin's smart contract functionality (allowing multisig and timelocks to control updating a name) interacts with PKI use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we generalized Namecoin and Tor PKI to work with non-TLS protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How revocations can be handled securely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we ensured anonymity (including Tor stream isolation) despite TLS implementations not providing API's for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Peergos: Capability-Based Access Control for an Encrypted Web</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Peergos, a peer-to-peer protocol for end-to-end encrypted storage, social networking, and application hosting built on top of libp2p. Peergos combines cryptographic identity, content addressing, and decentralized access control into a unified protocol where users fully control their data, identity, and applications without relying on trusted servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of treating encryption as an add-on, Peergos integrates cryptographic capabilities directly into its data model: files, directories, social data, and application state are all encrypted and access-controlled by default. We will explain the design of Peergos’ capability-based access control, how key rotation and sharing work in practice, and how identity portability is achieved without central authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also introduce the Peergos application sandbox, which allows untrusted applications to operate over private user data without exposing plaintext or keys. This enables privacy-preserving apps such as social feeds, collaborative editing, and backups to run directly on encrypted storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will include live demos and a discussion of performance trade-offs, limitations, and open problems in decentralized encrypted systems, including search, discovery, and offline access.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ocapn.org"&gt;OCapN&lt;/a&gt; (Object Capability Network) is a secure messaging protocol designed for the next generation of distributed applications. It leverages the capability security model (if you don't have it, you can't use it) to provide secure, peer-to-peer functionality with ergonomics that resemble ordinary programming. It has a rich set of features including promise pipelining, network transport agnosticism, error handling across networks, distributed acyclic garbage collection, and third-party handoffs providing powerful ways to share references with any peer. This talk will provide a tour of the protocol and show how it makes distributed, peer-to-peer development easier.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;iroh is a library to establish direct connections between two peers, wherever they are on the internet. It takes care of using different transports and holepunching as needed, to reliably establish connectivity. To the application a normal QUIC connection is presented. The aim is to be a connection layer for p2p, providing greater user agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there is a QUIC connection between two peers other network protocols can be run on top. iroh encouranges mixing and matching custom protocols as the application needs them. Two such building blocks maintained by the same team are iroh-gossip and iroh-blobs, implementations of gossip and verified streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After explaining how the core iroh system works and what applications need to understand the idea of how iroh encourages modular protocols will be described and iroh-gossip and iroh-blobs building blocks will be presented briefly as part of this.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NextGraph is a protocol, a framework, and a platform that supports development of Local-First, decentralized, secure and private apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining the best of the local first world (Yjs, Automerge CRDT libraries), a graph database, DID (decentralized identifiers) for users and documents, and end-to-end encryption plus encryption at rest, we provide an SDK that offers all the requirements of portability, interoperability and security needed today for a true alternative to Big Tech platforms and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we would like to dive into details of implementation of the E2EE sync protocol, the specifics of an encrypted sync protocol for CRDTs, the cryptographic capabilities that enable decentralized access control, and our 2-tier overlay network based on a pub/sub. Our philosophy is "zero single point of failure". With that in mind, we completely got rid of dependencies on DNS, and only rely on IP. Our broker can be and should be self-hosted, and forms a federation of decentralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol and SDK can be used to develop any kind of app, including messenger, productivity tools, editors, and social networks. All apps developed with our SDK can be built to webapp, Linux, Android, iOS, macOS and Win, thanks to the use of Tauri. All our codebase is in Rust, and MIT/Apache 2.0 of course. We recently released a new ORM mechanism that does all the heavy lifting of managing the database. Developers just need to declare the schema they want to use, and then objects are directly mapped to reactive components in React, Svelte, VueJS, via proxies and signals.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Walkaway-Stack describes a peer-to-peer system where applications remain functional even if the underlying "event delivery" infrastructure changes. This enables seamless transitions between different network types—whether moving from a "connected" Internet stack to a "connectionless" mesh network, or from radio protocols to sneakernets, and vice versa. In this way, applications are decoupled from the underlying network, giving users the autonomy to choose their preferred infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll explore the space more broadly—examining why it's so exciting, why it's not fully solved yet, and where things currently stand. Hopefully, this will also reveal a theoretical overlap between "mesh protocols" and "overlay networks," which may actually be more closely related than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lecture will be a compressed version of the "p2p lecture series" I've been then running bi-weekly in our community space "offline" in Berlin: https://pads.offline.place/p/r.06dda241c03ad92f2a55c47f4bbdd419&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reticulum is a cryptography-based networking stack designed for resilient, decentralised mesh communication without central coordination, source addresses, or trusted infrastructure. While the reference implementation in Python demonstrates the architecture’s strengths, running it on mobile and embedded systems revealed major performance bottlenecks: high latency, limited throughput, and heavy CPU overhead, especially on Android devices. This led us to re-implement Reticulum in Rust, a language whose safety guarantees and mature cryptographic ecosystem enable a fundamental architectural redesign rather than a direct port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents Reticulum-rs, a modern async Rust implementation that eliminates circular dependencies, clarifies module boundaries, and enables components such as links, channels, and transport to be reasoned about and tested independently. We will discuss the concurrency model required for a fully distributed mesh, the challenges in rewriting a large cross-linked system in a type-safe language, and the roadmap toward embedded Rust and no_std targets for future low-power hardware. Finally, we introduce early applications built on the new stack, including a peer-to-peer VPN and MAVLink bridge operating over Reticulum, outlining how a high-performance Rust core unlocks new use cases across mobile mesh, and distributed robotics domains.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;qaul is a P2P mesh communication app, with a strong focus on privacy and usability. Every user is identified via their self-sovereign cryptographic identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It not only communicates P2P, but builds a mesh network, interconnecting multiple communication such as BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), Local Area Networks, and Internet overlay links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messaging app has an automated user discovery, end-to-end encrypted direct messaging and group chats for text, voice-messages and files, as well as public communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During the past year, Delta Chat has been working on multi-transport chat messaging - you are no longer restricted to one server hosting your identity and transmitting your messages. Instead, the decentralized chatmail relay network transmits your messages, while your identity remains on your devices only, through the cryptographic key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we go into the technical details of multi-transport. We show how we migrate the ecosystem to this new approach, and how it can be introduced without taking away the seamless messaging experience from users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The growing use of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) has introduced a new challenge with six different types exist (Design, Source, Build, Analysed, Deployed, and Runtime). As each type captures component information at a unique point in the development lifecycle, it is no longer sufficient to say that you want an SBOM' ypu mered the right one which meets your use case. So how do you determine which SBOM type is the right fit for your specific use case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session attempts to provide the answer through the use of the creation of a sample application moving through the entire development pipeline, demonstrating precisely how the SBOM's content evolves from an initial Design SBOM to a final Runtime SBOM captured within a runtime environment. It will demonstrate the critical information that can be gained at each stage, the specific use cases that each SBOM type enables, and the practical challenges that still need to be overcome to create reliable, high-quality SBOMs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern embedded products are no longer single-processor devices. A typical architecture combines a Linux-based main system, one or more microcontrollers running RTOS workloads, and cloud-side processing also running on Linux. Each of these components produces its own SBOM - often using different formats, tooling, and levels of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you need to use all of them together for vulnerability management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares a real-world journey of attempting to aggregate and analyse SBOMs across heterogeneous parts of an embedded product. We will walk through the practical challenges encountered: incompatible SBOM formats, ambiguous identifiers, conversion tools that fail in unexpected ways, and friction between ecosystem assumptions and embedded reality. The goal is to highlight what currently works, what does not, and what the community could improve to make multi-SBOM workflows feasible for embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with concrete insights, pitfalls to avoid, and a clearer picture of the current limits of SBOM-based vulnerability management in complex (but totally common) embedded architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Contextual SBOMs and impact on vulnerability management</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Various tools producing SBOMs for pre-built artifacts, such as container images, usually provide only a flat list of components - packages, libraries, RPMs, and binaries - without explaining where any of them originated. But why does this origin information matter, and how can we obtain it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simply introduce the concept, imagine your build ecosystem as a bakery: the built container is the loaf of bread, and your SBOM is the ingredient label on the package. While customers only see a flat list of ingredients, bakers actually care about where each one came from, because they are responsible for the quality and safety of the final product. The same applies to components in a Containerfile. As the "building factory", we need to know the provenance of every package, library, and binary - not just that it exists, but whether it came from a base image, a builder stage, or was installed directly in the final Containerfile. This provenance information, captured in a Contextual SBOM, is essential for effective vulnerability management. Once an issue appears, understanding vulnerability origin determines whether we must update a base or builder images, update a Containerfile-installed package, or rethink the build process entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will show how we transform a plain, flat SBOM into a structured, layered Contextual SBOM, and what benefits this brings. We will demonstrate how contextual provenance helps us identify vulnerabilities faster and more reliably, and how it improves our overall vulnerability-management workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Topics:
- Limitations of traditional SBOMs: Why flat, non-contextual SBOMs fall short in containerized build environments where content origin is unclear
- Introducing Contextual SBOM: An overview of contextual SBOMs and how they enrich component data with provenance
- Differentiation base image vs. installed content: distinguishing inherited base-image content from software added directly in the Containerfile
- Tracing builder-stage content: Identification and attributing content copied from builder stages in multistage builds to final image
- Using Contextual SBOMs in vulnerability management: How provenance-aware SBOMs accelerate triage, clarify responsibility, and improve remediation decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is ideal for security professionals, compliance officers, compliance auditors, developers and anyone involved in the supply chain aspects of software.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When a new CVE surfaces in an open-source dependency, teams face an immediate question: Do we really need to update? Is the vulnerability &lt;strong&gt;eploitable&lt;/strong&gt;? In practice, nearly 90% of reported issues never affect the consuming application, but identifying the critical 10% is far from trivial. Reachability analysis offers a path forward by tracing vulnerable functions from the upstream component through multi-hop call graphs to determine whether the affected code is ever invoked downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its value, reachability analysis is notoriously difficult to automate. Most organizations still rely on manual investigation, while existing SCA tools frequently fall short, leaving teams uncertain and prompting unnecessary upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a concrete case study from Apache Hadoop and Solr, illustrating how accurate reachability analysis can prevent wasted effort, reduce noise, and focus attention on the vulnerabilities that truly matter. The reachability of vulnerabilities will be analyzed using the Open Source VEX Generation Toolset project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>From Passive Data to Active Defense: Supply Chain Policy-as-Code with Conforma</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The modern software supply chain is no longer suffering from a lack of data. Between SBOMs, SLSA provenance, and vulnerability scans, DevOps teams are drowning in attestations. However, a critical gap remains: the ability to aggregate this diverse evidence and enforce consistent, automated security decisions. Simply having an SBOM does not secure your pipeline; verifying its content against a trusted policy does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce &lt;strong&gt;Conforma&lt;/strong&gt;, an open-source tool designed to address the enforcement gap in supply chain security. We will move beyond static documentation and demonstrate how to implement an automated, blocking Policy Gate that enforces integrity before deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn how to transition from passive observation to active enforcement using &lt;strong&gt;Policy-as-Code&lt;/strong&gt;. We will demonstrate how Conforma acts as a central engine that ingests various security artifacts, including SBOMs, in-toto attestations, and vulnerability reports, to evaluate them against strict policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a detailed look at the tool's capabilities, we will showcase two concrete policy checks: &lt;strong&gt;SBOM Content Hygiene&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SLSA Provenance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with a clear understanding that supply chain data is only as valuable as the policies that enforce it. They will learn how Conforma automates this verification, turning a passive collection of attestations into an active, enforceable defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CRA-Ready SBOMs: A Practical Blueprint for High-Quality Generation</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="sboms-and-supply-chains">SBOMS and supply chains</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As one of the co-leaders of the CISA working group on &lt;a href="https://github.com/SBOM-Community/SBOM-Generation"&gt;SBOM Generation&lt;/a&gt; and a contributor to its accompanying &lt;a href="https://github.com/SBOM-Community/SBOM-Generation/blob/main/whitepaper/Draft-SBOM-Generation-White-Paper-Feb-25-2025.pdf"&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve spent the last few years deep in the trenches of SBOM creation. With the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) raising the bar for software transparency and lifecycle security, the need for &lt;em&gt;reliable, high-quality&lt;/em&gt; SBOMs has never been more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll present a practical blueprint for SBOM generation that goes beyond minimal compliance and helps projects prepare for the expectations emerging from the CRA and similar regulatory frameworks. The model breaks SBOM creation into four clear phases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authoring&lt;/strong&gt; – producing the initial SBOM from a lockfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augmenting&lt;/strong&gt; – resolving gaps and adding metadata to meet increasingly strict transparency requirements that SBOM generation tools can't do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enriching&lt;/strong&gt; – improve the quality of the SBOM using open data sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signing&lt;/strong&gt; – provide attestation to ensure the SBOM can be trusted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll discuss the technical considerations behind each phase, common pitfalls, and how these practices help projects avoid the compliance gaps many teams are now discovering as the CRA timeline approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ground everything in reality, I’ll also demo an open-source implementation of this entire workflow that runs directly inside &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; (or any CI environment), enabling maintainers to adopt a CRA-ready SBOM pipeline without proprietary tools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;500,000 SBOMs -- that's the scale of Deutsche Bahn's software supply chain. We will show how we extend our automated collection of Source, Build, Artifact, and Runtime SBOMs from both internal systems and external suppliers, and how we make this data usable. Doing this, we understand that SBOMs are not a tool by themselves but a supporting method for various use-cases. To facilitate them, we heavily rely on FOSS tools, enriched with own logic to fit into our enterprise architecture. You love diagrams? We have them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tools and clever ideas aren't enough. We need people to integrate them into pipelines and continuously monitor the quality of the resulting SBOMs and derived findings. We depend on cooperation from operators of related internal services. And we also need support from our governance stakeholders. Join this session to hear about our journey, where we stand today, and what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SBOMs have become the poster child of supply chain security. Everyone's generating them, regulators are demanding them, and compliance tools are built around them. But, the same package gets identified differently across tools, ecosystems, and standards. You end up with multiple SBOMs for the same software that can't be correlated, cross-referenced, or meaningfully compared - or actionable for vulnerability exploitability and remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Package-URLs (PURLs: https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) solve the identification problem to make SBOMs actually useful. A PURL provides a universal, standardized identifier for any package across any ecosystem. This simple spec makes supply chain tooling interoperable, enabling vulnerability databases, compliance tools, and SBOM generators to speak the same language about packages, regardless of source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the latest PURL developments that are making it essential infrastructure: validation tools, expanded ecosystem support including AI/ML model identifiers, growing adoption in major security tools and databases, integration into SBOM standards like SPDX and CycloneDX, and community-driven efforts to standardize package identification across the entire supply chain landscape. We'll show real examples where PURLs enable cross-ecosystem vulnerability tracking, make SBOM validation actually possible, and simplify compliance workflows by providing a common identifier system everyone can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title is provocative, but the reality is complementary: SBOMs describe your software's composition, PURLs make those descriptions machine-readable and universally meaningful. You'll leave understanding how PURLs are becoming critical infrastructure for supply chain security, why major projects and ecosystems are adopting PURL, and how to integrate PURLs into your own tooling and compliance automation workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SPDX 3.1  is transforming from a flat bill of material scheme to a knowledge graph” that now covers hardware, supply-chain security and  safety tests, and the 130+ crypto algorithms that are used on your data.   The AI/Dataset profile added three must-have lines for every smart assistant—AI Agent, Prompt, and RAG so you can see exactly how your AI system (Basiic AI, GenAI and Agentic AI) was  created &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPDX has also added a SPDX crypto lalgorithm list  which is similar to the methodology and process that was used for the SPDX License list.    There are over 130 algorithms that have been reviewed by the SPDX  Working group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrate some newly  available SPDX SBOM tools   that can automate creating SBOM for  existing AI system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will:
1. Show the ontology and  how a single spdx:Element can simultaneously be:
 hw:Chip (Hardware  )
da:Requirement (Design-Assurance)
crypto:Algorithm (Cryptology)
sc:TransportEvent (Supply-Chain)
2. Show  how to query the knowledge graph to: 
“Return every AI model that was trained on dataset x deployed on a hardware y whose root-of-trust implements one of the 130 curated cryptographic algorithms, and that passed a functional-safety test required by CRA.” 
3. Show how the new classes in AI/Dataset profile and relationship can document an Agentic AI system&lt;br /&gt;
4. Demonstrate how for CRA, ISO 42001, and FDA  : where each regulation asks a different question, but all questions can be seen as graph walk(s).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will present a multi-layered semantic structure for modelling and examining software supply chains using Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), and a case study of its application to analyse CERN's computing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary software ecosystems depend significantly on FOSS components, but SBOMs only offer standalone snapshots of elements, missing integrated perspectives on organisational context, vulnerability propagation, and internal software behaviour. This study integrates Semantic Web technologies, graph-based dependency modelling, and function-level structural analysis to overcome these limitations. At the organisational level, diverse SBOMs, survey data, licensing details, and vulnerability records are integrated into an ontology-based knowledge graph, facilitating expressive queries and automated reasoning throughout varied software landscapes. At the project level, the Vulnerability-Dependency Graph (VDGraph) model integrates SBOM dependency details with vulnerability information from Software Composition Analysis(SCA) tools, aiding the analysis of how vulnerabilities spread through dependency chains. Ultimately, at the code level, function-call graphs described by node centrality metrics and Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeddings reflect the structural significance of functions within an application, providing insights on how updates in dependencies might influence internal behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created during an internship at CERN’s Open Source Program Office, this framework offers a complete, scalable method for understanding, managing, and safeguarding intricate software supply chains within large and heterogeneous organisations. The framework has been put in practice to perform an analysis of CERN's computing ecosystem during 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Build-time SBOMs for traditional C/C++ applications have historically been difficult to generate.  To improve this situation, we have been extending &lt;a href="https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf"&gt;pkgconf&lt;/a&gt; to support generating high-quality build-time SBOMs, as the pkg-config database already understands all of the build dependency relationships needed for a build-time SBOM.  This talk is intended to be a walk through using the new pkgconf 3.x SBOM tools to generate a high quality build-time SBOM for a project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Enhancing Swift’s Supply Chain Security: Build-time SBOM Generation in Swift Package Manager</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides a detailed inventory of software components in an artifact. SBOMs allow developers to improve the supply chain security of their Swift projects by analyzing direct and transitive dependencies for vulnerabilities. Currently, Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) lacks built-in SBOM support, and developers must rely on third-party tools that can under- or over-represent package dependencies in a project, leading to a lack of critical information or too much noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses on an in-development feature to integrate SBOM generation directly into the Swift toolchain. As a result of this upcoming integration, developers will be able to create industry-standard CycloneDX or SPDX SBOMs as part of their build, without additional configuration. We will delve into the design in which SwiftPM employs the resolved modules graph to generate accurate SBOMs that capture both package and product dependencies, and optionally incorporates SwiftBuild build system’s build graph to align the SBOM with build-time conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listeners will be introduced to the basics of SwiftPM, learn more about the upcoming SBOM generation design that leverages SwiftPM’s existing graph structures, and have the opportunity to provide feedback before the feature is released.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://buildstream.apache.org/"&gt;BuildStream&lt;/a&gt; is a software integration tool that allows building software aggregated from multiple sources in a single pipeline to produce a final output. This final output could be a container image, an operating system image or anything that you can write a plugin for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I present &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream-sbom/"&gt;buildstream-sbom&lt;/a&gt;. It's a tool that extracts information from a BuildStream project and uses it to generate an SPDX-formatted SBoM. I also discuss the issues that I had translating from BuildStream concepts to SPDX.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hardware extensions for confidential computing establish a strict trust boundary between a virtual machine and the host hypervisor. From the guest’s perspective, any interaction crossing this boundary must be treated as untrusted and potentially malicious. This places significant hardening demands on guest operating systems, especially around firmware interfaces, device drivers, and boot components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores how COCONUT-SVSM can act as a trusted proxy between the hypervisor and the Linux guest, restoring trust in key firmware and memory-integrity interfaces. By offloading sensitive interactions to the SVSM, we can simplify guest OS hardening and provide a more secure boot process for confidential VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Restartable confidential guests on QEMU hypervisor - where is the challenge?</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Currently QEMU hypervisor based confidential guests on SEV-SNP, SEV-ES and TDX are not at-par with other non-confidential guests in terms of restartability. For confidential guests, once their initial state is locked-in and its private memory pages are encrypted, its state is finalized and it cannot be changed. This means, in order to restart a confidential guest, a new confidential guest context must be created in KVM and private memory pages re-encrypted with a different key. Today, this means that upon restart, the old QEMU process terminates and the only way to achieve a reset is to instantiate a new guest with a new QEMU process on these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resettable confidential guests are important for reasons beyond  bringing them at par with non-confidential guests. For example, they are a key requirement for implementation of the F-UKI idea [1][2]. This talk will describe some of the challenges we have faced and our experiences in implementing SEV-SNP and TDX guest reset on QEMU. A demo will be shown that reflects the current state of progress of this work. A link for the demo video will also be shared.
This will be mostly a QEMU centric presentation so we will also describe some fundamental concepts of confidential guest implementation in QEMU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIP patches based on which the demo will be shown are here [3]. These patches are posted in the qemu-devel mailing list for review and inclusion into QEMU [4].&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first introduce Intellectual Property Encapsulation, the confidential computing feature of Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontrollers, and multiple vulnerabilities we have found in it. Then, I will propose two methods of mitigating these vulnerabilities: first, a software-only solution that can be deployed on existing devices; second, a standard-compliant reimplementation of the hardware on an open-source CPU with more advanced security features and an extensive testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OpenCCA: An Open Framework to Enable Arm CCA Research</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="confidential-computing">Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Confidential computing is rapidly evolving with Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. However, unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, Arm CCA lacks publicly available hardware, making performance evaluation difficult. While Arm's hardware simulation provides functional correctness, it lacks cycle accuracy, forcing researchers to build best-effort performance prototypes by transplanting their CCA-bound implementations onto non-CCA Arm boards and estimating CCA overheads in software. This leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent comparisons, and high barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present OpenCCA, our open research framework that enables CCA-bound code execution on commodity Arm hardware. OpenCCA systematically adapts the software stack—from bootloader to hypervisor—to emulate CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. Our approach allows researchers to lift-and-shift implementations from Arm’s simulation to real hardware, providing a framework for performance analysis, even without publicly available Arm CPUs with CCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss the key challenges in OpenCCA's design, implementation, and evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness through life-cycle measurements and case studies inspired by prior CCA research. OpenCCA runs on an affordable Armv8.2 Rockchip RK3588 board ($250), making it a practical and accessible platform for Arm CCA research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Challenges of Remote Attestation for Confidential Computing Workloads</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Confidential Computing poses a unique challenge of Attestation Verification.
The reason is, Attester in Confidential Computing is infact a collection of Attesters, what we call as Composite Attester.
One Attester is a Workload which runs in a CC Environment, while the other Attester is the actual platform on which the Workload is executed. The two Attesters have separate Supply Chains (one been the Workload Owner deploying the Workload) while the Platform is a different Supplier, say Intel TDX or Arm CC.
Another deployment could be a Workload been trained on a GPU (via means of Integrated TEE) attached to a CPU, to create an end-to-end secure environment. How can one trust such a Workload, along with the CPU which is feeding the training data to it?? 
To trust a Composite Attester, through remote attestation one needs multiple Remote Attestation Verifiers, for example one coming from CPU Vendor the other from a GPU Vendor. 
How do the Verifiers coordinate?  Are there topological patterns of coordination that can be standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will highlight the Work done in IETF Standards &amp;amp; Open Source Project Veraison to highlight:
1.  Composite Attesters
2.  Remote Attestation though Multiple Verifiers
3.  Open-Source Work done in Project Veraison to highlight how Composition of Attesters can be constructed  in a standardized manner
4.  Open Source Work done in Project Veraison to highlight how Multiple Verifiers can coordinate to produce a Combined Attestation Verdict for a Composite Attester.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We have released the sample codes for remote attestation on cloud confidential computing services. I report the lessons learned from them.
https://github.com/iisec-suzaki/cloud-ra-sample
The samples cover multiple types of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): (1) Confidential VMs, including AMD SEV-SNP on Azure, AWS, and GCP, and Intel TDX on Azure and GCP; (2) TEE enclaves using Intel SGX on Azure; and (3) hypervisor-based enclaves using AWS Nitro Enclaves. As verifiers, the samples make use of both open-source attestation tools and commercial services such as Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA).
This talk aims to share these observations to support developers and researchers working with heterogeneous TEE environments and to help avoid common pitfalls when implementing remote attestation on cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>bare-sgx: A Bare-Metal C Runtime for Intel SGX Development with Minimal Trust</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A decade after Intel SGX’s public release, a rich ecosystem of shielding runtimes has emerged, but research on API and ABI sanitization attacks shows that their growing complexity introduces new vulnerabilities. What is still missing is a truly minimal and portable way to develop enclaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will introduce our recent work on "bare-sgx", a lightweight, fully customizable framework for building SGX enclaves directly on bare-metal Linux using only C and assembly. The initial code was forked from the Linux kernel's selftests framework and explicitly encouraged by prominent kernel developers. By interfacing directly with the upstream SGX driver, bare-sgx removes the complexity and overhead of existing SGX SDKs and library OSs. The result is extremely small enclaves, often just a few pages, tailored to a specific purpose and excluding all other unnecessary code and features. Therefore, bare-sgx provides a truly minimal trusted computing base while avoiding fragile dependencies that could hinder portability or long-term reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although still young, bare-sgx aims to provide a long-term stable foundation for minimal-trust enclave development, reproducible research artifacts, and rapid prototyping of SGX attacks and defenses.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Standardization and Open-source Implementation of Attested TLS for Confidential Computing</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track slug="confidential-computing">Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attested TLS is a fundamental building block of confidential computing. We have defended our position (cf. &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-fossati-tls-exported-attestation-expat/"&gt;expat BoF&lt;/a&gt;) to standardize the attested TLS protocols for confidential computing in the IETF, and a new Working Group named &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/seat/about/"&gt;Secure Evidence and Attestation Transport (SEAT)&lt;/a&gt; has been formed to exclusively tackle this specific problem. We would like to present the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fossati-seat-expat/"&gt;candidate draft&lt;/a&gt; for standardization and gather feedback from the community, so that it can be accommodated in the standardization. We demonstrate that the alternative standard candidate &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fossati-tls-attestation/"&gt;draft-fossati-tls-attestation&lt;/a&gt; is vulnerable to diversion and relay attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a specification that defines a method for two parties in a communication interaction to exchange Evidence and Attestation Results using exported authenticators, as defined in &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9261"&gt;RFC9261&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, we introduce the cmw_attestation extension, which allows attestation credentials to be included directly in the Certificate message sent during the Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake authentication. The approach supports both the passport and background check models from the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9334/"&gt;RATS architecture&lt;/a&gt; while ensuring that attestation remains bound to the underlying communication channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WiP Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tls-attestation/attestation-exported-authenticators"&gt;WiP Implementation&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;a href="https://github.com/veraison/rust-cmw"&gt;veraison/rust-cmw&lt;/a&gt; implementation of &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap/"&gt;RATS conceptual messages wrapper&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a test which demonstrates using it with QUIC (for transport) and Intel TDX (as confidential compute platform): &lt;a href="https://github.com/tls-attestation/attestation-exported-authenticators/blob/main/tests/quic_tdx.rs"&gt;tests/quic_tdx.rs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a practical approach to building a high‑assurance core
infrastructure for home and small business environments, using modern open
firmware on commodity server hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AI workloads move from cloud to on‑premise, the need for trustworthy and
attestable hardware platforms for running models and handling sensitive data
becomes critical. But what does "trustworthy" actually mean at the
hardware/firmware level, and can we realistically achieve it with today’s
platforms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through how to build a system based on a modern AMD server board
combined with open‑source firmware (coreboot[1] and OpenSIL[2]) to gain more
control and transparency across the boot chain. We will discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How open firmware and silicon initialization enable a stronger supply chain
  transparency and verifiability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to establish, measure, and attest a minimal and understandable firmware
  and software stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to combine this with AMD’s security and confidential computing features
  to protect workloads and keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical pitfalls when deploying such systems at home or in small
  organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to show how open firmware can complement security and confidentiality
computing features to create a platform you can actually inspect, reason
about, and attest from top to bottom - rather than treating the hardware and
firmware as opaque, trusted black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
