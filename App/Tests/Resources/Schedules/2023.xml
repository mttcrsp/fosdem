        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;February 2023 marks the 25th Anniversary of Open Source. This is a huge milestone for the whole community to celebrate! In this session, we'll travel back in time to understand our rich journey so far, and look forward towards the future to reimagine a new world where openness and collaboration prevail. Come along and celebrate with us this very special moment!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The open source software label was coined at a strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California. That same month, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded as a general educational and advocacy organization to raise awareness and adoption for the superiority of an open development process. One of the first tasks undertaken by OSI was to draft the Open Source Definition (OSD). To this day, the OSD is considered a gold standard of open-source licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we'll cover the rich and interconnected history of the Free Software and Open Source movements, and demonstrate how, against all odds, open source has come to "win" the world. But have we really won? Open source has always faced an extraordinary uphill battle: from misinformation and FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) constantly being spread by the most powerful corporations, to issues around sustainability and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll navigate this rich history of open source and dive right into its future, exploring the several challenges and opportunities ahead, including its key role on fostering collaboration and innovation in emerging areas such as ML/AI and cybersecurity. We'll share an interactive timeline during the presentation and throughout the year, inviting the audience and the community at-large to share their open source stories and dreams with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;h3&gt;The abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NLnet Labs and Red Hat are closely following two legislative proposals from the European Commission applicable to almost all hardware and software on the European market;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), intends to cover products including digital elements, like software, with cybersecurity conformity requirements and obligations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new Product Liability Directive (PLD) is looking to extend liability for defective products to the world of software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The audience will learn about the CRA and PLD from different angles: from their respective authors at the European Commission, from a small, public benefit organisation producing and supporting upstream open source software, and from organisations promoting, using and distributing open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session will be divided in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series of lightning talks from representatives of the European Commission and NLnet Labs to introduce the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A panel, moderated by Red Hat, with participation from Digital Europe, the EC Open Source Program Office, Red Hat and NLnet Labs to share views and opinions about the future of open source software within the current and future legal framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The session will be split into two parts as follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lightning Talks (~45min)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to the Cyber Resilience Act by Benjamin Boegel from DG-CNECT at the European Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cyber Resilience Act from a NGO involved in open source by Maarten Aertsen, NLnet Labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to the new Product Liability Directive by Omar Ennaji from DG-GROW at the European Commision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Panel (~45min)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel theme is: How to proceed as a community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maarten Aertsen, Sr Internet Technologist, NLnet Labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gijs Hillenius, IT Project Officer, EC DIGIT Open Source Program Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoey Stambolliu, Sr Policy Manager, Digital Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romuald Vandepoel, Chief Digital Advisor for Public Sector, Red Hat Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;supporting the panel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benjamin Bögel, Policy Officer, EC DG-CNECT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omar Ennija, Legal and Policy Officer, EC DG-GROW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The ELISA Project - Enabling Linux in Safety Applications </title>
        <subtitle>Projects insights and overview</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The ELISA project aims to make it easier to build and certify Linux-based safety-critical applications. This lecture will give an overview of the goals and technical strategy of the ELISA project. It provides information about the different work groups, their interaction, and contributions. Attendees will leave the talk with an understanding where the ELISA project stands today and what comes next. They get insights which methodologies and tools are used, which challenges exist, and why the different puzzle pieces are all needed for enabling Linux in safety-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Safety-critical systems as addressed by the ELISA project are those, where failure could result in loss of human life, significant property damage or environmental damage.
ELISA members are working together to define and maintain a common set of tools and processes that can help companies demonstrate that a specific Linux-based system meets the necessary safety requirements for certification.
These existing working groups focus on Linux Features for Safety-Critical Systems, Software Architecture, Open Source Engineering Process, Tool Investigation and Code Improvement. They are complemented by vertical use case working groups dealing with Automotive, Medical, and Aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Linux Inlaws</title>
        <subtitle>A how-to on world domination by accident</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - Janson</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in early 2020 our podcast named Linux Inlaws has gathered an average audience of just short of 8,000 listeners per episode and continues to grow in this fashion. What started out as a hobby project (and to a certain degree still is) covers - peppered with a dash of humour - a wide variety of topics ranging from political and social to technology subjects; attracting key industry figures and projects including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation Europe, Mozilla's CTO, Nextcloud and BSD core devs to name but a few guests on the show so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk gives an overview of the history of the podcast since its creation followed by a discussion of the general approach, the philosophy behind the format and its organisation. A section on the technology stack that drives the highly automated workflow behind the scenes will be of interest not only for buddying fellow podcasters but anybody concerned with media production and distribution in general. In addition, the hosts will shed some light on the challenges we have faced over the years and how these were overcome. The talk concludes with a discussion of the road ahead for the Inlaws and their next twenty years (if not more :-) of making a difference in the community and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How Meta manages to take offline millions of pictures, videos and text that violate its community standards, all of them adversarially engineered, in a catalog that counts in the trillions. We'll talk about open source technologies that embrace vector search, state of the art in neural and non-neural embeddings, as well as turnkey solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Content moderation is a problem that affects every service that hosts user uploaded media. From the avatars to a personal collection of pictures, the platform holds the responsibility of removing the violating content.
The problem can be tackled with clssifiers, human moderators and by comparing media signatures; this presentation will be about the latter.
Similarity Detection is an approach that tries to detect media based on an archive of "definitions" (yes, like the antiviruses) of things that have already been classified as violating.
But how do we measure similarity between images from the perspective of a machine (not to mention video/audio clips of different lenghts)? The answer is not MD5...
We'll talk how we do it, what technologies you can use too and how we can leverage a public, crowdsourced archive of signatures to defeat various threats, from terrorism to misinformation to Child Exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FOSS powers the digital world we live in, but ensuring the long-term sustainability of the software and community can be challenging. In this talk, we will explore sustainable open source from three key perspectives: community, financial, and engineering practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three perspectives — community, financial and engineering practices — are vital for long-term sustainability of free and open source software projects. Abby will share insights and case studies on how well-crafted processes in each area can create a strong foundation for future success. She will draw on her experience as a maintainer of key open science projects, as well as a mentor and supporter to over 700 open source projects in GitHub's Top Maintainer program, UNICEF Venture Funds, and Mozilla Open Leaders. She will also discuss practical strategies for building effective open-source ecosystems, and ways to ensure the longevity of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience will leave with a better understanding of the importance of investing in sustainable open source practices, with tangible strategies for creating and sustaining successful projects. Join us for an engaging discussion on how to build a strong foundation for the future of free and open source software!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LF Research was founded on a track record of excellence in research led by the Linux Foundation, on topics such as exploring the Kernel at 30, or the FOSS Contributor Survey in partnership with the Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard. Since its launch in April, 2021, Linux Foundation Research has published two dozen reports based on empirical methodologies that describe open source as a paradigm for mass collaboration at scale. LF Research projects fall into four frameworks: industry vertical analysis, technology horizontal analysis, geographic/regional analysis, and ecosystem analysis, for research projects that span all industries, technologies, and regions. It has become a mechanism through which the open source community can share feedback and perspectives in an open and transparent way. Among the early reports published was Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Source: Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities to Create Agency and Equity Across Open Source Ecosystems. This report and others in financial services, film and entertainment, SBOMs, and cybersecurity, identify developer and contributor experiences, motivations, and priorities among other trends and key findings, specifically when it comes to securing software supply chains. This talk will identify what developers and contributors have said they experience, need, and want most across numerous LF Research studies, identify opportunities for the audience to access open datasets, and how to become further involved in the research process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Modern systems have come a long way from waking up every 16 milliseconds to peek and poke into a framebuffer which was directly displayed to the user. A single image frame may begin in a camera, be pushed through an image signal processor, be sent through several layers of web browser for processing and using the GPU to add funny hats, then be sent simultaneously to a media codec to send to your friends, as well as onwards through the window system to your display controller, possibly with colour correction, alpha blending, and more, along the way. These systems are every bit as complex as they are poorly understood. In this talk, Daniel will attempt to answer all the questions you never knew you had, such as: is GBM really the Generic Buffer Manager? What's wrong with fbdev? How do I even allocate buffers? Why won't Wayland give me 1000fps on glxgears? If GPUs are so very fast, why does everyone tell me I can't use them because they're slow? And what do these window system people even do all day, anyway? The talk is aimed at anyone who wishes they understood the complexity of modern display pipelines, plans for future development, and how to develop applications &amp;amp; products that use the full capability of modern hardware at maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Can we do an open source chip design in 45 minutes?</title>
        <subtitle>The state of free and open source silicon</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free and open source silicon, the art and craft of making computer chips with (only) free tools, has come a long way -- and has now reached the magic threshold where it can't be ignored any more. In this talk, we'll do a fast-paced journey through what's needed to go from an idea for a silicon chip to actually producing a real physical one using free and open source tools and building blocks. And since talk is cheap, we'll actually build a chip design during the talk in a live demo. Join to learn more about what's possible today, how free and open source is permeating the established industry, and how you can get involved as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, producing a "real" silicon chip was an effort that required a large-ish team, a fair amount of money, and inside knowledge that only a small, selected group of individuals and companies had. That has changed: free and open source silicon is here, and it democratizes access to chip design for anyone. Free tools in all areas of chip design, from simulation to synthesis and physical design, have attracted renewed attention and are at a point where they are powerful enough to be used for actual chip tapeouts. The last barrier of entry for prospective chip designers fell with the announcement of the SkyWater PDK two years ago: real-world design rules, required to manufacture chips, are now freely available as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll look at the open source silicon ecosystem: which tools do we have available, how are they working together in a toolflow, and can all of that be combined to produce a working chip?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source software has irrevocably changed the way software is developed. Open source silicon is set to do the same: inject new life into the traditionally closed chip development ecosystem, combining ideas from the open source software world with the accumulated wisdom of seasoned hardware engineers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce one of the latest Fedora Remixes, the Asahi Fedora Remix! Asahi Fedora Remix exists to assist the Asahi community with Apple Silicon upstreaming and to provide a nifty ARM-based Fedora Workstation for those that own Apple Silicon hardware. We will discuss packages we have forked: kernel, kernel-edge, mesa. Some of the new characteristics of this distro include, 16k page size, a kernel built with rust drivers and hence a kernel built with clang/LLVM. We will show some performance results against some other x86 and aarch64 machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the community side, we will discuss some core values we try our best to abide by, such as our "upstream everything" attitude.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>DNF5: the new era in RPM software management</title>
        <subtitle>How we rewrote the codebase and started loving the community</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Package managers are essential tools in any Linux system, designed to install, upgrade, remove, and manage software. For several years, Fedora had YUM, which became DNF eleven years ago. Now, DNF5 will replace DNF and be the new Fedora standard.
In this talk, we will give an introduction to DNF5. We aim to address our new design principles and how our choices fix some of DNF's design flaws. We will present a live demo of the new product to showcase some features of DNF5 and make comparisons with DNF. Lastly, we will cover our plan to improve communication, inclusion, and openness with the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is public knowledge that the DNF codebase became cluttered and, at times, substandard, cutting off a large slice of the open-source community from participating in the development process and decision-making process. Likewise, historical design decisions held DNF back from evolving into a modern and sustainable package manager.
We want to answer how certain design issues were addressed, and why the structure of DNF5 impacts environments such as the desktop, containers, and CI.
Moreover, we will go over the user experience of our command-line interface in the live demonstration, with some examples of common use cases and a speed comparison of processing commands between DNF and DNF5.
Lastly, we will discuss how DNF5 enables us to work closer with the community. A thoroughly documented codebase, transparent upstream issue tracking, and open feature planning and delivery are all requirements that we intend to fulfill.
Our target audience is people with some degree of expertise in package management or who are proficient using DNF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Maker Tools in the Browser</title>
        <subtitle>CAM to 3D Printing: Zero Install, Always Up to Date</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The tools necessary for 3D printing, CAM and CNC, and other maker-based activities are available to run instantly in the browser with no software to install. This is ideal for STEAM education, online coursework, maker spaces, or anywhere you either can't install software or can't keep it up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern browsers expose substantial computational power with access to multiple cores, shared memory, GPUs, and near-native code execution with Web Assembly. It is possible to present complete browser-based replacements for applications that were previously only the domain of desktop-installed software. Add in the capabilities of Progressive Web Apps, we get always-on, always up-to-date applications that start instantly and have a fraction of the footprint of their desktop counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The focus of this talk, Kiri:Moto, was started in late 2013 as a 3D printing slicer when the cohort of available tools was very limited. It has since evolved to handle 4-axis CAM, laser cutters, and mSLA output targets. Kiri:Moto was one of the first slicers to support belt 3D printers. And this cutting-edge work will soon extend to 5 axis FDM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiri:Moto runs both online and offline (as a progressive web app) in standard browsers as well as mobile devices and tablets. It pushes the boundaries of what's possible inside the browser sandbox using web workers for distributed computing, WASM for accelerated computation, and ThreeJS for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The active base of users skews toward college and high-school classrooms, maker-spaces, and individual creators. It is available (also free) inside of Onshape's web-based CAD, helping to make a complete in-browsers stack requiring no software installation to go from design to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Passwordless Linux -- where are we?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Passwordless authentication is making a lot noise. Use of FIDO2/WebAuthn tokens and other passwordless means to login to web services is all the rage but there isn't that much available to make the technology usable without troubles for 'traditional' Linux systems, locally and remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For past several years FreeIPA and SSSD teams have been working on enabling end to end passwordless access in centralized and local environment, be it corporate or home deployment. This talk will go into details of our progress in passwordless access implementation for Linux systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022 FreeIPA project introduced ability to authenticate users against OAuth2 identity providers (IdPs). This functionality allows to obtain Kerberos credentials after authentication and authorization has been done by the external IdP. As many OAuth2 IdPs allow passwordless authentication with WebAuthn tokens, a true passwordless transition across Linux systems is now available, from login to console, raising privileges within PAM services (e.g. sudo access), to accessing remote systems over SSH. We hope to expand this support with native FIDO2/WebAuthn integration as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is not complete yet and needs a lot of collaboration across multiple open source projects. Come to this talk to see a demo and discuss how we can improve our passwordless experience together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Winners and Losers in FOSS</title>
        <subtitle>Open Source Has "Won" - Have We?</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free and Open Source Software not only permeates nearly all of our digital technology systems, but we see increasing amounts of institutions actively contributing to its creation and maintenance. From technology monoliths to universities to governments, the number of “open source developers” has increased, and with it, open source software. It is no secret that Open Source has “won,” according to many. However, despite the sheer scale of FOSS development today, has the form much of our FOSS infrastructure has taken benefited all in the ways that we expect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will take participants on a journey through the history of labor in FOSS development to better understand the political economy of FOSS development and what it means for individual FOSS contributors. This talk will use economic analysis to bring up many inspiring steps forward we have taken and also raise many worrying questions about the software we are building.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The contents of this talk will be based on the 2021 research paper “The Evolution of Open Source: Winners and losers in volunteer production,” which can be found at the following DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/4CHFN. This paper discusses the material history of FOSS and provides an economic analysis of how labor is the primary means of control of FOSS rather than copyright. Therefore institutions that control significant amounts of labor through the hiring and coercion of workers can dictate the primary benefits of FOSS infrastructure in many of the same ways one could through utilizing copyright.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fair threaded task scheduler verified in TLA+</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Algorithm for fair multithreaded task scheduler for languages like C, C++, C#, Rust, Java. C++ version is open-sourced. Features: (1) formally verified in TLA+, (2) even CPU usage across worker threads, (3) coroutine-like functionality, (4) almost entirely lock-free, (5) up to 10 million RPS per thread.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;"Task scheduling" essentially means asynchronous execution of callbacks, functions. Some kind of a "scheduler" is omnipresent in most services - an event loop; a thread-pool for blocking requests; a coroutine engine - you name it. Scheduler is an important basis on top of which the service’s logic can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamedev is no exception. I work at Ubisoft - we have miles of code used in thousands of servers, mostly C++. There is a vast deal of task types to execute: download a save, send a chat message, join a clan, etc. Often they compose one multi-step task: (1) take a profile lock, (2) download a save, (3) free the lock, (4) respond to the player. Between each step there is a waiting time until the operation is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the game engines’ backend code had a simple scheduler generic enough to be used for every async job in all servers. It juggled tasks across several internal worker threads. But it had the following typical issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfairness. Tasks were distributed to worker threads in a round-robin. If tasks differ in duration, some threads can appear choking while others are idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polling. In a naive scheduler multi-step task execution works via periodic wakeup of the task. When awake, the task checks if the current step is done and if it can go to the next one. With many thousands of tasks this polling eats notably more CPU than the actual workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The talk presents a new highly efficient general purpose threaded task scheduler algorithm, which solves these problems and achieves even more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete fairness - even CPU usage across worker threads and no task pinning;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coroutine-like - API to wake a task up on a deadline and for immediate wakeup;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No contention - operation is mostly built on lock-free algorithms;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal correctness - the scheduler is formally verified in TLA+;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the scheduler was implemented in C++ and embedded into several highly loaded servers, it gave N-fold improvement of both RPS and latency (more than x10 speed up for one server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time the talk is not C++-specific. It is rather a presentation of several algorithms combined in the scheduler. They can be implemented in many languages: at least C, C++, Rust, Java, C#. Only need support of atomics and threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is completely open source - https://github.com/ubisoft/task-scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tools for linking Wikidata and OpenStreetMap</title>
        <subtitle>Software for adding links between open data projects</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wikidata and OpenStreetMap are collaborative open data projects that contain structured data for real world places and things. Adding links between the projects makes the data more useful, but doing this by hand is laborious. I've written a software tool that automates much of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Editors of OpenStreetMap can use my software to search for a place or region, generating a list of candidate matches from Wikidata, which can then be checked and saved to OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking the two projects isn't without controversy. They use different licenses which raises questions about what information from one project can be copied to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presentation I will give details of a new version of the editing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will talk about the benefits of linking, the process of finding matches, the community response - including the controversy - and how people can get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Helios is a simple microkernel written in part to demonstrate the applicability of the Hare programming language to kernels. This talk briefly explains why Helios is interesting and is a teaser for a more in-depth talk in the microkernel room tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks. Helios uses Hare to implement a microkernel, largely inspired by seL4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you need to step away from your current focus to invest in the future. One of the most effective ways to approach community building is through the lens of pathways to leadership. A path that invests in new maintainers is the backbone of creating a welcoming, diverse, and sustainable open source community. In this talk, we’ll use the Mountain of Engagement framework to break down how open source projects can level up their community and invest in new maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways how FOSS projects coordinate and inform about their localization effort. Wiki pages, forums, READMEs, etc. And there are different platforms and servers. Should there be something unified to ease the orientation for translators? Something like TRANSLATE.md?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you really know what your users think about you? If you’re not doing user interviews, you probably don’t. In this talk, Emily Omier will help attendees understand why user interviews are so important, how to run an interview that provides good information and what to do with the information you get. Spoiler: often the best interviews are also the most awkward.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While the Wikimedia Foundation is best known for its flagship project, Wikipedia, and the MediaWiki software that powers it, the Foundation's open-source ecosystem extends far beyond these well-known projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore the fascinating world of Wikimedia's open-source tools ecosystem and the cloud infrastructure that makes it possible. We will showcase some of the coolest tools and projects, and we will highlight the unique opportunity that the Foundation offers for contributing to its cloud infrastructure – a rare chance to work on infrastructure for a cause that does good in the world, supporting the Foundation's mission of providing free and open knowledge to the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a seasoned open-source developer or a newcomer to the field, this talk will provide valuable insights and inspiration for getting involved in Wikimedia's vibrant community of contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;using a mountain metaphor instead of choropleth or cartogram visualisations has some use in showing similarities and differences between places. data mountains are a bit like bar charts on a map, but their mountainous shape makes the bars resemble topographic features!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;using #nbdev to publish the package was fun because it makes it much easier for python teams to collaborate on jupyter notebooks in git as it cleans json metadata with a pre-commit hook that prevents merge conflicts, and it also makes it very convenient to document, test, and share code and packages on the web, pypi, and conda.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CoffeOSM is a tool that helps users improve OpenStreetMap by scanning the text on receipts from shops and checking if the place is already listed in OpenStreetMap. If the place does not exist, CoffeOSM suggests ways to insert it. This talk will discuss how CoffeOSM works and the benefits it brings to the OpenStreetMap community. We will also showcase examples of how CoffeOSM has been used to add new locations to OpenStreetMap and demonstrate its user-friendly interface. Attendees will learn how they can use CoffeOSM to contribute to the OpenStreetMap project and help make it even more comprehensive and accurate. I'll also ask for help to gather receipt example from different countries.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Breaking the Code of Inclusion: Designing Micro Materials Based on PRIMM Principles for Accessible Programming Education.</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Setting your first steps in the world of programming can be a daunting task. The tools used are unforgiving, and learning materials are too often based on rote learning and writing code from scratch.  Many learners feel excluded and like they do not belong, this is especially true for learners that are from groups underrepresented in programming education. In recent years the Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make (PRIMM) approach has been proposed to help students by focusing on learning how to read code before moving on to learning how to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk we will discuss how open source micromaterials can be created as small side or hobby projects, taking into consideration these concepts. We will do so by discussing some open source micro-materials we made, but we will also take a look on how to ensure that your contributions provide educational value.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Open Source Good Governance – GGI Framework presentation &amp; deployment</title>
        <subtitle>A quick introduction to the OSPO Alliance handbook and resources</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Good Governance Initiative (GGI) proposes a management framework to help shape, build and develop an OSPO, from the roadmap definition to the actual implementation of best practices, and further down the road to a full strategy that will actually deliver the greater benefits of the community and ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will briefly present the method and content of the Good Governance Initiative Handbook, and demonstrate how to put it in action through the automatic deployment of a personalized dashboard to implement the method in a local context. We will also review how you can participate and contribute to the initiative and help translate it into your own language.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every organization nowadays heavily relies on open source software and ecosystem; therefore, enabling a solid and resilient software supply chain and innovation has become a key topic for many. Open Source Program Offices are an essential enabler for this change, yet many organizations still lack the proper understanding and vision to actually define and organize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GGI methodology is a community-built framework, part of the OSPO Alliance launched in 2021 by European non-profit organizations (OW2, Eclipse Foundation, OpenForum Europe and Foundation for Public Code) and developed as an OW2 Initiative. It is entirely managed as an open source project, collaboratively developed on GitLab, and is progressively enriched and fueled by end-users feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Eurorack is the leading standard for building modular music hardware, arguably cause for some of the wierdest sounds in the electronic music industry. Despite the existence of development platforms for Eurorack focused on using commodity microcontrollers and the availability of (closed source) FPGA-based synthesizer modules, there is currently no easy way to get started in creating your own FPGA-based music synthesizer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk Sebastian will present his 'eurorack-pmod' project, a collection of open-source hardware, gateware and software that makes it easy to get started in the world of FPGA-based audio synthesis using only open-source tools (such as Yosys + KiCAD). This talk begins with an overview of music synthesis in the context of Eurorack and illustrates how the 'eurorack-pmod' hardware and gateware makes it easy for you to get started making your own high performance music hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>FabAccess</title>
        <subtitle>a machine access system for fablabs and makerspaces</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We are developing an open source federatable management system for FabLabs, Makerspaces and Hackerspaces. FabAccess aims to manage access to machines in order to avoid accidents.
FabAccess has three main functionalities:
- Machine management
- Authorization system
- User management&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Machine management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to combine Neil Gershenfeld's idea of users learning to operate machines independently with the requirements of open workshops that users do not injure themselves in the process. Thus, users need instruction for dangerous machines, and this principle is then reflected in the authorization system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle of FabAcces is to switch machines on and off via the power connection or via internal firmware. This way, machines are normally de-energized and therefore harmless. Only when users are at the machine who are competent and instructed for safe operation, the machine gets connected to the power supply by FabAccess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The management of machines that require cleaning after use is supported, either. This ensures the usability of machines for the next user and reduces wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also support the reservation of machines, but we do not want to take over scheduling for the users. Therefore, as a compromise we implement that users can reserve machine only for half an hour (as a modifiable parameter). So they don't have to worry about someone else using the machine while they commute to the FabLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Authorization system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorization system makes it possible to allow access to machines only for certain users. Thus, it can be used to map instructions for dangerous machines, but more complex mappings are possible due to the high configurability of the RBAC system (role-based access system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to map simple machines that do not require instruction but need to be used in a somehow structured way (workplaces, tools, lockers, ..).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;User management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user administration should make it possible not to lose track of the users in the space. FabAccess is intended to be used as a SmartCard system, so each user receives an NXP Mifare DESFire (FabCard) card to authenticate himself at the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the administrative effort, users can register on their own and can then be activated after the operator has checked their data. The user contract is mapped in the process and may be integrated into other systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wildfires, flood, severe windstorms and heatwaves are just a few of the “new” emergencies that have become more frequent in the European Union. While we’re used to preparing for major disasters - earthquakes, cyclones - it’s time to start thinking about how good maps can save lives and help us navigate better these increasingly common events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a view to preparedness and disaster reduction, we’ll take a look at features worth mapping in OpenStreetMap -- parking lots, vacant businesses, gas stations, ad hoc "cooling centers" -- that you might otherwise overlook and give a short overview of tools like Mapillary and StreetComplete.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At Scaleway, we built a large-scale PXE-based imaging infrastructure to manage the fleet of machines that power our various storage services. Using this infrastructure, we can reliably deploy new machines—and reconfigure existing ones—in predictable ways. In this talk, we will explain the problems we had to solve, how we reasoned through these issues, and what we built to solve the problems. Improved reliability, decreased time to production, increased stability, and all of this without sacrificing usability or end-user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the project, the existing fleet deployment and management systems—which had grown organically over the previous years—were in need of an upgrade. We embarked on a new initiative with an aim to reduce the time to deployment, increase the reliability of those deployments, and improve the maintainability of the management infrastructure as a whole. Leveraging PXE, Ansible, chroot, DHCP, and a clean monorepo backend, we were ultimately able to scale the number of managed machines by orders of magnitude—without linearly scaling the time or resource commitments for the sysadmins. In this talk, we’ll look at architectures, code examples, decision trees, challenges, and solutions. At the end of the session, the audience will have a better understanding of not only the technologies involved, but also the business cases behind those choices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you nowadays work with and on the cloud or simply *-as-Code, chances are you came into proximity of ‘Yet Another Markup Language’ (YAML). Deceptively simple in appearance, YAML provides you with a plethora of ways to shoot yourself in the foot. This talk discusses a number of common pitfalls. In a nutshell: Why YAML is not as easy as you may think.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CNI 2.0 is coming. And we all rely on CNI for setting up our networking in Kubernetes. But what do YOU want to see in it? Doug wants to let you know what he’s been thinking about for CNI 2.0 – and invite you to join the revolution. Did you know CNI is container orchestration agnostic? It’s not Kubernetes specific. Should it stay that way? People are looking for translation layers between Kubernetes and CNI itself. Have you engaged in the war between JSON and YAML? If you’re a Kubernetes user, and a CNI user, maybe you have. We need a way to make sure these disparate worlds meet, peacefully. Let’s make sure CNI is here to stay to give the community the flexibility in Kubernetes networking that we all deserve, and fight the good fight for our sysadmins so we keep the CNI API alive to promote a healthy open source ecosystem and avoid vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Staging of Artifacts in a Build System</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At a time where make was developed, a simple and computationally cheap solution
to the problem of how to handle the relation between artifacts and files was
needed. Each artifact is associated with a file in the filesystem and the
timestamp of the file was used to determine which actions (recipes) need to be
executed. Traditionally, to be backwards compatible with make, subsequent build
systems also implemented this concept. However, there is no technical reason to
do it like this. Instead, it even has a couple of advantages if this concept is
abandoned and no association of artifacts with the filesystem is done. Nowadays,
where content-addressable storage is a widely applied concept and actions are
anyway executed in an isolated environment may it be in a separate directory or
in a sandbox, this problem can be tackled by a complete separation between
physical and logical paths, which is also called staging. Input and output paths
of an individual action are abstracted away. Thus, each target has its own view
of the world and can place generated artifacts at any logical path they like.
Consuming targets may place these generated artifacts at a different logical
location. This allows to define build targets independently of their actual
location and in particular allows to refer to targets from other repositories.
This simplifies the handling of different repositories. All what matters is how
the target is defined and not where. This concept is implemented in an
open-source build system, which is publicly available under the following link:

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A journey from single documentation files to a meaningful information architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sovereign Cloud Stack combines the best of Cloud Computing in one unified standard. SCS is built, backed, and operated by an active open-source community worldwide. As only the sum of different repositories complete the SCS Stack, it is important to have an easy and accessible documentation of the SCS Project in one place. In this talk you will be taken on our journey on how we have developed a low invasive workflow to bring together all individual docs to a unified collection that is being generated to single page application using docusaurus. A journey that takes us from a mere collection of markdown documents to a meaningful information architecture. With this talk we not only want to convey our story but invite you to feedback your experiences with such endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cloud and Open Source have a very intricate relationship! In this talk we will look at the history of how the impact of Cloud on Open Source changed through the years, examine the current state as well as make a case for a particular way to use Cloud and Open Source Together. If you cherish the values of Open Source - you will do well by using Cloud as Commodity Infrastructure Provider and run Open Source Software on top of it. Consider Kubernetes in particular as your API of choice with its ubiquitous availability among all major public cloud providers and private cloud software vendors. We will show what while this ecosystem may not be as mature as proprietary solution from cloud vendors it is moving rapidly and becoming a great fit for more and more situations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>We can and should learn from legacy on-premise data centers and the migration to the cloud to ensure the computing platform's future is bright</subtitle>
        <track>Sovereign Cloud</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There has been a significant shift from on-premise data centers to the cloud in the last fifteen years. This process was due to the perceived cost difference between the legacy on-premise data centers and the newer and shinier cloud. Due to a renewed interest in privacy and data sovereignty, many organizations
are returning to the on-premise. For the success of such initiatives, it is fundamental to learn from the past and understand how a modern on-premise data center would be structured.
I started working in 2004 when almost everything was on-premise, and I had a front-row seat to the migrations that occurred in this period thanks to my roles as a Systems and Solutions Architect.
In this talk, we will recap the last twenty years of migrations to learn some key lessons, and then we will analyze what a modern on-premise data center would look like, which technologies might help and which could be risky bets.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cloud brought many innovations - one of them is inexpensive, scalable and sometimes secure Distributed Storage options. In this presentation we will talk about distributed storage Options modern clouds offers ranging from elastic block devices and object storage to sophisticated transactional data stores. We will discuss the benefits and new architecture options such distributed storage systems enable as well as the challenges pitfalls you need to be aware about.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Solid is a protocol powered by W3C standards and the Semantic Web that intends to change the way the Web works by letting users bring their own storage to applications. It was introduced here at FOSDEM &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/solid_web_decentralization/"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and many new developments have happened ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been making Solid Apps for 4 years now, and in this talk I will go through my journey starting from having no idea about the Semantic Web. I'll share the lessons I learned along the way, and some of the challenges that are still ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Solid is a protocol, so even though I've got my stack of choice this talk will be framework agnostic. I will focus on the challenges and learnings that can be useful to any developer. If you've heard about the Solid Protocol before and are wondering what developing apps is like, this is the talk for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source has become the defining way of developing software. But how do we open-source the operation of software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Operate First Community Cloud is a peer-to-peer mentoring environment for running software in production, as well as a community for Cloud Native SREs to share knowledge about production practices. Using the same community-building process of open source projects, but extended to ops procedures and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experienced SRE’s find an outlet for sharing their knowledge and new talent get’s a chance to grow into an SRE role and get their hands on cloud-native projects in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this be a blueprint for a sovereign cloud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll discuss how opening operations can free up a cloud deployment and lead to the same independence that open source brought to software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How to make the climate case for a diverse cloud ecosystem</subtitle>
        <track>Sovereign Cloud</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this short talk, we'll present a way to see the discourse around digital sovereignty through a climate lens - understanding how the concepts that support having a vibrant diverse set of cloud providers can result in a healthy ecosystem climate wise , and also in terms of values alignment too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll introduce a useful model, known as the Green Web Triangle, for talking about the trade-offs we currently make when choosing digital services that can help technologists have productive conversations with budget holders and policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll explore how competing on transparency with open source is a valid strategy where existing incumbent cloud providers cannot do the same - organisations with legally binding carbon reductions are now required by investors and policy to report on efficiency and sustainability in ways that are currently impossible with most incumbent providers, but doing so will be a legal necessity, as new laws around sustainability reporting come into effect in 2024. We'll end with Q and A to explore these new developments and how to make the most of the changing policy landscape to move towards a more open, diverse ecosystem of companies building the cloud platforms we need for a sustainable, pluralistic diverse internet.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Co-op Cloud is a software stack that aims to make hosting libre software applications simple for small service providers such as tech co-ops who are looking to standardise around an open, transparent and scalable infrastructure. It uses the latest container technologies and configurations are shared into the commons for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project launched public beta in May 2022 and has seen a lot of interest from hosters, hackers and end-users. We are currently in the process of forming our organisational model which help us make decisions collectively and work towards financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll give a status update on the Co-op Cloud ecosystem and where we're going. The thinking and principles of the project closely overlap with the ideas of the Sovereign Cloud and the intersection of the needs of end-users and infrastructure providers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I would like to present the importance of the core Collaborative Softwares using by individuals and companies in this stack and the progress and challenges of the Open Source communities providing alternative solutions and the importance of all European countries to collectively support the actors in the Open Source communities providing solution in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the latest years, the subject of European Digital Sovereignty is gaining ground. Clearly the dominant position of the BigTechs is making both European companies, Countries but also individual increasingly dependent on the product and services of the BigTechs. In order to regain our sovereignty we need to look at the full stack, from hardware, to cloud and to the software running on those hardware and clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I would like to present the importance of the core Collaborative Softwares using by individuals and companies in this stack and the progress and challenges of the Open Source communities providing alternative solutions and the importance of all European countries to collectively support the actors in the Open Source communities providing solution in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will show the progress made in the last years by different providers of Open Source solutions (NextCloud, Matrix, BigBlueButton, Jitsi, XWiki, CryptPad and many others), describe the challenges and difficulties when building Open Source products and competing with the extremely powerful actors that we are facing (including monopoly abuses), but also make proposals on how we could make them work better together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Pandemics and wars have woken up countries and companies to the strategic vulnerabilities in their infrastructure dependencies, with digital sovereignty now being a top concern, especially in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short talk, Thierry Carrez, the General Manager for the Open Infrastructure Foundation, will explore the critical role that open source has to play in general in enabling digital sovereignty. In particular, he will explore how Open Infrastructure (open source solutions for providing infrastructure), with its interoperability, transparency and independence properties, is essential to to reach data and computing sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Launched by the European Commission in December 2021, under the sponsorship of Commissioner Thierry Breton, the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud has the objectives of strengthening the position of the EU industry on cloud and edge technologies, and meeting the needs of EU businesses and public administrations that process sensitive categories of data. The Alliance brings together relevant stakeholders from the private and public sector to jointly define strategic investment roadmaps to enable the next generation of highly-secure, distributed, interoperable, and resource-efficient sovereign cloud and edge technologies. This talk will provide a summary of the role that open source plays in the EU technological roadmap that the Alliance will be publishing by the end of January 2023, and will explore the different ways in which collaboration around open source technologies can contribute to building a future European sovereign cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sovereignty is more than having control over data and complying to data protection legislation.
We'll dive into some important aspects and link it to the Open Source movement.
The presenter will share how the Sovereign Cloud Stack translates these aspects into its project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital Sovereignty and Sovereign Clouds are becoming hot topics in the public discussion. However, we observe the terms being used in inflationary manners -- which reminds us of greenwashing marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's discuss what aspects there are of digital sovereignty. What options, possibilities, powers could operators and consumers of digital technology have and what balance can be stricken between them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can technology change the balance? In particular how do modern cloud/container platforms play into this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology does make a difference.
The Sovereign Cloud Stack has identified three areas where it wants to contribute in support of the consumers: Standards, Fully Open
Implementation, and Open Operations. These topics will be introduced and filled with real-world experience from the SCS project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned from managing Kubernetes cluster resources in an open-source community in a transparent git-ops way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the design patterns for Kubernetes resource management in cluster fleets in order to achieve uniformity, auditability, transparency, and effectiveness. In particular, we will talk about cluster policies, and effective repository structures promoting manifest reuse and collaboration through Kustomize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kustomize is a first-party tool for manifest composition allowing cluster admins to create simple yet powerful and context-aware file structures for resources that require centralized management. This lightning talk aims to share our personal experience in Operate First Community Cloud in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Quickwit is an opensource distributed search engine.
The most challenging component of a search engine is its indexing pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a stream of JSON documents, processes them in batches, and emits index artefacts we call splits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed our implementation to be robust, testable, observable, and efficient...
But even more importantly, our code had to be easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will explain why we chose to develop our own actor framework and discuss the unique
features of our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How lnx is solving the challenges of builing a distributed search engine in Rust</subtitle>
        <track>Rust</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Follow me as I walk through my journey of building lnx, a distributed search engine written in Rust akin to Elasticsearch or Algolia that aims to be faster and more efficient using tantivy.
I cover the challenges and solutions I encountered while developing lnx over the last year, the tradeoffs made and how you can build your own search engine using the tools the Rust ecosystem provides.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk we'll look at what a search engine like Algolia or Elasticsearch does, how tantivy works, what things we need to do in order to make it suitable for user-facing search and how we implement it into our code to build our own application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the talk I talk about the biggest issue you run into when building a search engine or any other system designed to store data... Fault tolerance and replication, together we'll go through the challenges of implementing this for a search engine using tantivy, keeping the performance competitive, reliable and the tradeoffs that are made to make it work. We'll look at some existing implementations like Raft and take a dive into the world of eventual consistency!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any luck, you'll have a better understanding of how we can build services like search engine using libraries like tantivy along with solving technical challenges like consensus and replication for distributed systems in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Aurae: Distributed Runtime</title>
        <subtitle>A new node init system written in Rust</subtitle>
        <track>Rust</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I share the motivation, goals, and architecture of my new project Aurae. Informed by my experience of operating large production platforms I discuss my thesis of how bringing deliberate runtime controls to a node will unlock a new generation of higher order distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience walks away with an in-depth understanding of the current state of affairs Rust and the Aurae runtime project. We learn about my journey to Rust from working with Go in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an accomplished Go engineer who has made the jump into Rust and I believe my story is worth compiling and sharing with FOSDEM. I believe there will be many like me in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aurae is on a mission to be the most loved and effective way of managing workloads on a single piece of hardware. My hope is that by bringing a better set of controls to a node, I can unlock brilliant higher order distributed systems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurae takes ownership of all runtime processes on a single piece of hardware like systemd, and provides mTLS encrypted gRPC APIs (Aurae Standard Library) to manage the processes. Aurae has a new style of isolation called "Aurae Cells" that manage cgroups and namespaces directly from pid1. With Aurae Cells the project offers a way to slice up a system using various isolation strategies for enterprise workloads including MicroVMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn about 3 specific parts of the project and how they influenced the decision to move to Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing cgroups (v1/v2) directly with Rust, and how kata containers and systemd influenced the container runtime module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mTLS encrypted gRPC with tonic and rustls. Learn why I have given up on OpenSSL and where rustls is working well and not so well for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving ephemeral short lived microVMs with Aurae, and how we "spawn" a new host and kernel into a microVM that shares properties with the parent instance of Aurae.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I talk about my journey to Rust from Go and why I believe it is necessary to reimagine parts of Kubernetes in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Presentation of BastionLab, a Rust open-source privacy framework for confidential data science collaboration</title>
        <subtitle>The reason of why Rust is the most appropriate language for our project</subtitle>
        <track>Rust</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present BastionLab, a Rust open-source privacy framework for confidential data science collaboration.
We aim to help data owners open access to their datasets to outside data scientists. The current approaches, such as opening Jupyter notebooks, provide no elaborate control over what is shared. Datasets can easily be extracted from them, which means they offer little privacy guarantees and make data collaboration difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BastionLab provides an interactive interface for data scientists to explore remote datasets, yet answers the privacy concerns of data owners, as only results compliant with the privacy policy defined by the data owners can be communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data exposure is limited as data scientists never have direct access to the data, they can only use a limited set of operators which preclude arbitrary code execution to exfiltrate data, and a strict access control policy is put in place. Differential Privacy and Trusted Execution Environments are supported as well to ensure maximum privacy.
We will provide an example to show how a COVID dataset could be shared to a remote data scientist to perform data exploration, cleaning and visualization, while making sure only anonymized results are communicated.
The server side of BastionLab is developed in Rust for its memory safety, performance and community. It allows the use of cutting-edge libraries like polars, an open source DataFrame library in Rust several times faster than pandas, the go-to solution in Python.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In programming we use editors and IDEs all the time. Previously if one use Vi/Vim like text editor it typically means you just edit soruce code as simple text, but nowadays things have been changed.
Especially after releasing support of the Language Server Protocol(LSP), which works as a client to LSP servers for example rust-analyzer.
This talk gives deep dive of Language server Protocol implementation for Rust
and how to build friendly relationships between rust-analyzer and Neovim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk i’ll start from brief of what’s LSP and rust-analayzer, some missing features you probably didn’t know about? E.g. go-to-definition, find-references, hover,
completion, rename, format, refactor, etc., using semantic whole-project analysis.
Also i’ll show you how to write you first plugin using Rust and interact with some LSP primitives. to turn you editor in God mode surf trough it like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>A Rusty CHERI - The path to hardware capabilities in Rust</title>
        <subtitle>A status report on ongoing efforts to support CHERI architectures in Rust</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CHERI defines hardware extensions to encode access constraints on pointers, enabling hardware enforcement of such restructions based on metadata stored alongside pointers. There is an ongoing drive to support compiling Rust code in a way that can make use of these extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this provides another layer of protection. We can encode knowledge about provenance validity, bounds and other access restrictions that the compiler (and OS/etc.) knows about in a way the hardware can enforce at runtime. The Rust memory model is famous for being able to enforce these types of restrictions at compile time, but not for unsafe Rust code. Unsafe Rust code needs to be written sometimes, which presents situations which can only be verified at run time. Some other nice benefits could come from this work. For example, runtime bounds checking can now be done by hardware rather than software, and since provenance information is necessary for operations on capabilities, closing gaps where it is not currently preserved forms a part of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is a discussion on what is required for this support, and gives an overview of the state of the various attempts to implement this support.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Slint is an Open Source GUI toolkit for Desktop and Embedded. It is written in Rust, and comes with a declarative UI description language that compiles into native Rust code.
We will present Slint and show how you can build an reactive GUI in Rust&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the question that often comes out is "Are We GUI Yet?". i.e. can you use Rust to create user interfaces?
Our answer to that question is "Yes, with Slint"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slint is an Open Source GUI toolkit. It scales from desktop platforms all the way down to micro controllers with only a couple of hundred of KB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the great tooling around Rust, it is also really easy to build a UI that can run on multiple different platform: Desktop native UI, wasm in the browser, or MCUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will be a presentation of Slint, demonstrating what you can do with it and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'm going over some lessons learned from building internal APIs in Rust as well as some public APIs such as the Redis rust crate, the insta snapshot testing library, the MiniJinja template engine and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It covers lessons learned from making mistakes, more crafty abstractions with generics and more of building libraries in Rust for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Started in 2014, the gccrs project is working toward creating an alternative
compiler implementation for the Rust programming language. At the moment, the
project targets the 1.49 version of the language and hopes to catch up once
that milestone is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that talk, we will explore some of the components inside gccrs, as well as
dive into some of the hurdles encountered during the project's lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will explore ways to cross-pollinate with the Rust community, in
order to help and benefit both projects. Specifically, we will dive into some
ways we plan to share components with rustc, and how to achieve that: namely,
we will look at how we plan on integrating the Polonius project to perform
borrow-checking inside gccrs, what our efforts with running the &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt; 1.49
testsuite are, and what we need to achieve to start being useful to the Rust-
for-Linux project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Efficient In-Memory Adaptive Stable Sorting on Modern Hardware</subtitle>
        <track>Rust</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sorting is one of the most common algorithms used in programming, and virtually every standard library contains a routine for it. Despite also being one of the oldest problems out there, surprisingly large improvements are still being found. Some of these are fundamental novelties, and others are optimizations matching the changing performance landscape in modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present Glidesort, a general purpose in-memory stable comparison sort. It is fully adaptive to both pre-sorted runs in the data similar to Timsort, and low-cardinality inputs similar to Pattern-defeating Quicksort, making it to our knowledge the first practical stable sorting algorithm fully adaptive in both measures. Glidesort achieves a 3x speedup over a Rust’s standard library Timsort routine on sorting random 32-bit integers, with the speedup breaking the order of magnitude barrier for realistic low-cardinality distributions. It achieves this without the use of SIMD, processor-specific intrinsics or assumptions about the type being sorted: it is a fully generic sort taking an arbitrary comparison operator.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Glidesort as the motivating example we discuss the principles of efficient stable in-memory partitioning and merging on modern hardware. In particular attention is paid to eliminating branches and interleaving independent parallel loops to efficiently use our modern deeply-pipelined superscalar processors. The lessons learned here are widely applicable to efficient data processing outside of sorting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also go into more detail on the various intricacies that Glidesort has to overcome in our Rust implementation. In particular how to deal with splitting and concatenating slices in a safe manner using GhostCell-style branding, the problems faced when dealing with panics in the comparison operator, and potential issues with interior mutability in comparison operators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/"&gt;Pydantic&lt;/a&gt; is a data validation library for Python that has seen massive adoption over the last few years - it is estimated that Pydantic is now used by about 10% of professional web developers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I've been working full time to rebuild Pydantic from the ground up, using Rust for virtually all the validation and serialization logic. Pydantic V2, with these changes included, will be released early in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Pydantic V2 before diving into how the use of Rust has allowed us to completely change the architecture of Pydantic to make it easier to extend and maintain while also improving performance significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the talk will be devoted to using examples from the pydantic V2 code base (rust and python) to demonstrate the advantages (and disadvantages) of writing libraries like Pydantic in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk should be interesting to any Rust or Python developer who's interested in combining the two languages - no knowledge of Python or Pydantic is required. However if you'd like to get some context or learn more about the topics discussed, here are some useful resources:&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Graphs are used in many different applications as they are an intuitive way for representing complex relationships between entities, as for example in social, communication, financial or geographical networks. Graphs in these domains can be very large, potentially spanning multiple millions and even billions of nodes and edges. In order to get analytical insights out of these structures, scalable implementations of graph algorithms are necessary. Rust is the ideal language for implementing such algorithms, due to its well-known aspects, such as "fearless concurrency" and memory safety as well as its great out-of-the-box performance and its expressive type system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our presentation, we will talk about the "graph" project, a collection of open source crates that we are working on. The project includes an in-memory graph representation, APIs for building in-memory graphs from various data sources, and a small collection of high-performance graph algorithms. In addition to these building blocks, we started developing a Python wrapper called graph-mate for a NetworkX-like experience and an Apache Arrow endpoint for integrating the project in distributed applications. The presentation will include a project overview, a walk through the Rust API, and a demo for using the project via Python.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When creating a script or a tool to manage your network configuration it is hard to decide which language should you use. In Nmstate we noticed we could get plenty of benefits from Rust. Nmstate is a library with an accompanying command line tool that manages host networking settings in a declarative manner written in Rust. In this talk, we are going to see how we combined several existing libraries and also created our own ones to create a powerful networking tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we will share our lessons learned from rewriting a project from Python to Rust. Of course, the talk will be full of crabs, so don't miss it!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Application developers working and testing with a specific kernel version should be able to easily control their application compatibility behavior with previous (and future) kernel versions as well. We developed a Landlock library (for security sandboxing purpose) that protects users as much as possible while making the work of application developers easier and safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk gives feedback about the development of a security library that needs to deal with backward and forward compatibility, because of security features tied to specific kernel versions, handling different use cases in a safe and secure way. We explain patterns that we used to make it possible to fine tune the requested (optional) features while providing a safe default behavior. For simple use cases, the idea is to provide a best-effort security approach for potentially unsupported kernel features: use available features and ignore others. However, in more complex use cases, we may want to make some features depend on others. We may also want to handle errors differently based on unsupported features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Atuin aims to make your experience with your shell history delightful. It stores every command and the context around it (eg, directory it ran in, duration, etc) in a SQLite database, and then provides fuzzy search on top of that. Along with the Atuin sync server, this history can be made available on every machine the user has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be walking the audience through how the project works, what problems it solves, as well as how it was implemented. I will assume the audience has some working familiarity with the shell, but the talk will be friendly for Rust beginners or anyone curious about the language.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Confused about all these new acronyms? Look no further: we will introduce and decode common terminology and concepts that are needed to follow the development of image-based Linux, especially covering other topics that will be presented and discussed as part of the devroom.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The UAPI Group introduced a set of acronyms, terms and concepts within the scope of image-based Linux. We will introduce topics such as UKI (Unified Kernel Image), DDI (Discoverable Disk Image), sysext (system extension), syscfg (system configuration), portables (portable services), and more.
We will discuss where these concepts apply, what they can be used for, how they integrate and form the basis of our vision for image-based Linux, and where they are implemented and how today.
Other talks in this devroom will make heavy use of these acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let's look at what Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) chips can do for you, and how they can help protecting your systems from online and offline attacks. We'll specifically focus on Linux image-based OSes, and how to secure them properly with a TPM and related technologies. We'll look at possible avenues for generic Linux distributions to make use of the now ubiquitous TPMs and how to catch up with ChromeOS, Windows and other OSes on this front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss concepts such as TPMs, UKIs, SecureBoot, DDIs, dm-verity, LUKS and more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The mkosi-initrd project builds initrds directly from system packages.
This means that there is no separate dependency and packaging system.
Normal system packages and services are used in the initrd.
This means that we don't need to build a duplicate set of scripts.
Systemd is used to the maximum extent — it sets up the environment and manages jobs in the initrd.
Requirements and dependencies for startup tasks must be expressed as unit properties.
Systemd's functionality is used to manage secrets, measure state,
and load system extensions to extend the initrd.
In this talk I'll cover the current state of the project (what works) and the plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ultrablue (User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth) is a solution to allow individual users to perform boot state attestation with their phone. It consists in a server, running on a computer, acting as the attester, and a graphical client application, running on a trusted phone, acting as the verifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical use-case is to verify the integrity of your bootchain before unlocking your computer, to prevent offline attacks on an unattended laptop. It can also serve as a debugging tool for secure boot issues after firmware upgrades or as a second factor for disk encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the boot of a PC, it is now common to have each stage store measurements of the next one into a TPM, in order to keep a tamper-proof log of the boot chain. Those measurements are then leveraged to seal secrets, eg. a disk encryption key, or to report the state of the device to a remote server in cryptographically secure way, using a procedure known as remote attestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote attestation has slowly gained traction over the last few years, most notably among cloud providers such as Azure, to guard access to online resources. It is also a key element in validating dynamic root-of-trust measurements (DRTM), which reduce the trusted computing base compared to traditional UEFI-based boot chains, but require a trusted third-party to validate the final state of the system. Unfortunately, little progress has been made recently to enable individual users without access to server resources to reap the benefits of remote attestation. This is particularly frustrating considering that almost everybody carries a small trusted server with them all the time: smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building upon an idea by Matthew Garrett (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FobfM9S9xSI"&gt;Linux Conference Australia, 2020&lt;/a&gt;), we introduce Ultrablue (User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth), a solution to securely inspect and validate a TPM event log from a phone. Ultrablue consists of a command-line attester, running on a computer, and an Android graphical application, running on a trusted phone, communicating over encrypted Bluetooth low-energy (BLE). Pairing the phone and computer is made easier and more secure through the use of a QR Code. After a trust-on-first-use provisioning phase to enroll the computer on the phone, the phone can check that the boot chain has not been compromised in later boots. Sample scripts and a self-contained virtual machine are also provided as a reference of how to integrate Ultrablue in the boot process to guard disk encryption by a secret delivered by the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future work includes improving the user interface to inspect and validate unexpected event logs, adding support for more versatile verification policies, and integrating Ultrablue into existing hardened systems such as Safeboot (safeboot.net).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ultrablue project has been developped at ANSSI (https://ssi.gouv.fr) by Loïc Falkau--Buckwell, under the supervision of Nicolas Bouchinet and Gabriel Kerneis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Imaged based systems are considered safer to update as a new image will only be activated via reboot as a whole. Images are rather static though as the OS image is typically delivered by the OS vendor. Package based systems on the other hand are very flexible wrt installed software. However, since packages are typically updated individually at run time, there are non-atomic, intermediate states states that may lead to undefined behavior. This talk presents a hybrid model that behaves similar to an image based system while retaining flexibility of package based systems, building on ideas from SUSE's MicroOS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Ubuntu Core: a technical overview</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Image-based Linux and Secure Measured Boot</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu Core is a different kind of linux. It offers image-based updates and secure boot with disk encryption. This presentation is a technical explanation on how this is achieved. We will focus on what makes Ubuntu Core different from other distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu Core is based on “snaps” which are readonly squashfs images with signed metadata. Everything on the system is a snap. This includes applications and the kernel. Snaps run in a lightweight container like environment with apparmor confinement and are isolated from each other and can only communicate via well defined security boundaries (“interfaces”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the main system is composed of a kernel snap, a bootloader snap, a base (rootfs) snap, and a snapd daemon snap. This granularity is useful to handle IoT hardware since much of the hardware needs custom kernels or bootloaders. Here a new initrd was developed and is presented in the talk. Some hurdles (like how to deal with /etc in a readonly image world) are also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>MachineOS: a Trusted, SecureBoot Image-based Container OS</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Image-based Linux and Secure Measured Boot</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Machine OS, designed for appliances used in lights-out/hands-off
environments, is an environment for Secure and Trusted booting of an
image-based Linux OS leveraging TPM 2.0 security chips to guard unique
platform secrets only made available if the chain of trust from the
platform, through the kernel and into user-space is verified.  The platform
secret is used to attest, at runtime, device and software veracity for
creating clusters of systems with a common root of trust extended from the
platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The secured (PCR7) initial environment of Machine OS checks a signed (Machine
OS CA) manifest of images present. It then verifies (dm-verity) the images
before handing over execution control.  Machine OS leverages opensource tools
for building (project-stacker), signing (notary/cosign) and hosting
(project-zot) such images.  The design of Machine OS has some similarities
with the UAPI proposal for Trusted/SecureBoot, making for an interesting
comparison on design goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our design is focused around the goal not of preventing alternative boot
images, but denying all images which are not verified access to a set of
TPM-protected secrets.  Furthermore, to support re-use of a single signed UKI
by multiple unrelated projects, image manifests are signed by product
certificates which are all signed by one company-wide CA, whose certificate is
shipped as part of the (protected) UKI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A migration to LibreOffice Technology is in a professional deployment a complex technical and non-technical task. Over time both worlds - the proprietary and the open - evolve further, so new or changing technical challenges for a migration appear and motivations for doing it are changing since the beginning of such projects over 20 years ago. May it be e.g. technical new devices like mobile/tablets or online apps or may it be motivations changing from cost arguments to a gain on digital sovereignty for example, all these new developments should be covered by state of the art migrations. A short journey through old but still present and new aspects are presented in this talk and how The Document Foundation proof quality of migration consultants for this with its certification program.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What motivates a potential code contributor? And a full-time free-software developer? A fun project.
LibreOffice development is fun, but also a real challenge, so we must consciously find the flow in it (not quite an oxymoron). While I present my recent LibreOffice, Numbertext, LibreLogo and Hunspell developments, partially sponsored by FSF.hu Foundation, Hungary, I collect the ten funniest moments of them, that were left out of the release notes (i.e. https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/7.5#Default&lt;em&gt;.E2.80.9Cspell&lt;/em&gt;out.E2.80.9D&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;currency&lt;/em&gt;formats, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/7.4#New&lt;em&gt;typographic&lt;/em&gt;settings, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/7.4#New&lt;em&gt;numbering&lt;/em&gt;in&lt;em&gt;Show&lt;/em&gt;Changes_mode etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Processing the wealth of Bugzilla data the LibreOffice generates can be done in R, and presenting it in Shiny is a good fit for it. Making a useful dashboard for the community is not only about pretty graphs and an avalanche of stats, it's also about directing potential QA contributors to relevant information and specific tasks, and prioritising some of the most pressing onces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Having your Office suite crashing is rather annoying, but crashing while opening or saving files is unsolvable for end users.
The upstream LibreOffice project regularly runs testing against this on master - but is it possible to do it on stable branches maintained for customers?
In this talk I'll introduce the set of test files and upstream scripts, and show how we use them to deliver added stability of LibreOffice for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice now supports dark mode on its major ports. Apple and Microsoft effectively omitted to support dark mode in the various APIs LibreOffice was using to render its widgets, making this surprisingly difficult to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice was capable of handling form filling in Writer for a while
already. In the meantime, the competition introduced Structured Document Tags,
which is their default since 2007, and our fields and form shapes model them
poorly. Writer Content Controls are meant to perform a great handling of this
third type of form filling. Some recent developments also happened in this are
in the past half year: PDF export, combo boxes, titles and aliases. Come and
see how this now starts to work in Writer, what still needs doing and how you
can help.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I held a presentation at LibreOffice Conference 2022 with the Title "LibreOffice graphics subsystems - History &amp;amp; Visions - From Win3.1 GDI to scene graphs". There I explained in detail the past, common and possible future graphics subsystems for LibreOffice. One aspect of this is the transition/escape path to get to new shores and allow to let old stuff completely behind, so reaching new shores.
When I prepared that talk I started to implement a complete and working example how to do system-specific PrimitiveRenderers. I promised to continue and finish that in my private time, so I managed to get a working version. In this talk/presentation I want to talk about the process, what experiences I made to create the example, about upstream stuff that had to be done in master to prepare the ground for others and about the state of affairs.
I will also make a short presentation/comparison with a version of the office that uses that new technic with the current one to present made achievements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Some proprietary graphic formats from the 90s like WMF are device dependent and hard to support. The standard is hard to navigate and implement and a lot of bugs can show up. Creating files for unit testing is not necessarily easy either. Come and find out how WMF bugs are debugged, fixed and tested.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Come hear about a new approach to enabling browser deployment of rich Office functionality - built on top of allotropia's investment in enabling the core LibreOffice technology to compile to Web Assembly (WASM) - combined with the Collabora Online front-end.
Hear about how this can be used to provide a fall-back (non-collaborative) editing mode for when you loose your network
connection for a while, and about the plans to re-synchronize documents on the return from such a tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;New technologies such as Kubernetes and methodologies such as microservices are changing how software is developed, delivered, and deployed. Additionally, bringing new products to the hands of users is happening much faster than before, making Continuous Delivery a critical aspect of doing business. The way we do business is evolving at a tremendous pace and keeping up with the technology and tooling can often put strains on companies regardless of size or number of employees. Knowing where to start is one issue but then once you’ve started how do you scale. Do you need more tools, which tools do you need, what resources do you have to help you pick the right path to keep your company running efficiently, how do you train your developers while they continue to do their day jobs? The CD Foundation was formed and incubates projects that address these challenges in an open-source, vendor-neutral manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using best practices from graduated projects like Jenkins and Tekton as well as incubating projects like CDEvents and Spinnaker, the CD Foundation is working on the CD Reference Architecture to help take the guesswork out of tooling and scaling and creating a blueprint on how to establish, structure or modernise your CI/CD infrastructure. This talk will go over some examples of the CD Reference Architecture and resources available to help make CD accessible for your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many teams want to have quality documentation, but often fail to keep their docs up-to-date. Maintaining docs can be a frustrating and tedious for smaller teams. In this talk, we are going to explore how we can use a CI/CD workflow to encourage teams to write and maintain documentation. I will demonstrate how tools such as Github actions and Vale can improve the quality and readability of documentation in the fraction of the time needed teams usually need to produce docs. In this talk I will discuss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the importance of quality docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to ensure that your docs maintain a consistent writing style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to maintain you docs using Vale and Github actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Platform APIs are usually tough to test. They hide complexity from users and abstract a wide range of backend services, ranging from heavy infrastructure over to simple SaaS APIs. Sometimes these processes can take up to hours to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will share our experience testing the platform API and introduce you to the tools we have written along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The actual platform API is provided through crossplane. Writing crossplane compositions is not always easy and testing them with all possible combinations and outcomes is even harder. It requires a lot of effort to make sure all components are deployed correctly and work as expected – especially if you have a lot of them. Since everything is written in YAML and crossplane is a relatively new technology, there is no standard set of tools to test everything yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test our compositions automatically, we have set up a CI pipeline that consists of two test stages: A static code analysis using our self-written linter for Crossplane that runs various checks, like ensuring that all patches are pointing to an existing resource property. The second stage consists of end-to-end tests built with Kuttl and compares the status of real provisioned infrastructure with the expected outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a continuously changing IT world, not being able to adapt is the difference between yesterday's and tomorrow’s projects. Everybody wants the benefits of changes but nobody wants to endorse its associated risk. I’ll share why we created Updatecli, an open-source declarative dependency manager. How automation helps us to anticipate, and fix early, our day-to-day challenges, and where the traps lie.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Moving to Kubernetes opens the door to a world of possibilities, but as the number of resources, clusters and namespaces grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will show how at Adobe Experience Manager we continuously deliver changes to cluster resources and have implemented a way of doing feature flags and progressive rollouts with Kubernetes yaml definitions, across multiple clusters and regions using Jenkins, ArgoCD, and other open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Running a cloud service in multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions, forced us to have high levels of automation, tied with monitoring and alerting across the globe.  The typical release train model (dev-stage-production) had shortcomings that soon became evident. Adopting Progressive Delivery allows us to move faster, safer, and reduce the mean time to recovery in case there are any issues. Both canary deployments and feature flags are typically used to implement Progressive Delivery at both application and operational service levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams collaborate with a DevOps philosophy and a "you build it, you run it" approach, with freedom, but also requiring tooling to help teams deliver value with the least interference as possible. We are continuously improving this tooling to make it as easy as possible to safely deploy changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CI/CD the GitOps way, involves automatically shipping your code from your local machine to the intended server, it could be a UAT or production environment. This is usually achieved through toolsets like source control provider  (Gitlab/GitHub), CI tool (Jenkins/Github Action),  Kubernetes Orchestrators among others. FluxCD is an Open-source tool that recently joined CNCF  family. FluxCD treats Git as the source of truth and ensures desired synchronisation is done with the intended cluster. These is achieved through a set of cluster Operators that ensures git commits are automatically deployed to the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitOps using flux not only automate the deployments but also integrates with a vast set of Open-source tools to ensure, cluster-wide and deployment Policies, enhanced Security, Visibility, and notification among others. It's architecture caters for velocity and Multi - Environment/teams and application deployments without compromising Privacy through Isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FluxCD also facilitates cluster infrastructure management the GitOps way, infrastructure like service meshes, CNI, and any other Kubernetes CRDs can be managed using FluxCD.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Giskard is an open source project that implements automatic tests for Machine Learning models. In this conference talk, we'll explain
(1) why testing ML models is an open problem,
(2) why testing ML models requires different tools compared with traditional software systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll then explain, using concrete examples, how our Giskard project helps ML Engineers deploy their AI systems into production safely by (1) designing fairness &amp;amp; robustness tests and (2) integrating them in a CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs pipelines in containers allowing developers to build
and debug pipelines locally and then run them anywhere avoiding vendor lock-in to a particular CI/CD
solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the portable pipeline concept may not be new, by combining that with the ability to write pipelines
as code (Go, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, CUE supported at the moment) instead of YAML, Dagger revolutionizes how CI/CD
pipelines are built and ran.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We all know that observability is a must-have for operating systems in production. But we often neglect our own backyard - our software release process. That was our mistake, which led us to wasting time and energy in handling failures in the CI/CD pipeline, and made our Developer-on-Duty (DoD) shifts tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this talk I’d like to share how we built effective observability into our CI/CD pipeline using intelligent data collection, dashboarding and alerting, to boost our response to failures and improve our quality of life on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give practical guidance on how to improve observability into your CI/CD pipeline. Whether you use Jenkins like we do, or other CI/CD tools, you’ll learn how to augment them and reach higher productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We manage a 200TB glusterfs cluster in production. While we were managing this, we learnt some key points. In this session, we will share with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the minimal health checks that are needed for a glusterfs volume, to ensure high availability and consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the problems with the current cluster expansion steps(rebalance) in glusterfs we experienced? How did we manage to avoid the need for a rebalancing of data, for our use-case. Proof of concept for new rebalance algo for future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are we scheduling our maintenance activities such that we never have downtime even if the things go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did we reduce the time to replace a node from weeks to a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the number of clients increased we had to scale the system to handle the increasing load, here are our learnings scaling glusterfs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to profile glusterfs to find performance bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why client-io-threads feature didn't work for us? How we improved applications to achieve 4x throughput by scaling mounts instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to Improve the incremental heal speed and patches contributed to upstream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Road map for glusterfs based on these findings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenStack and Ceph have a long integration story that changed over the time to make the two technologies coexist in the same context as basic building blocks of Cloud infrastructures.
ceph-ansible has been one of the most popular orchestrators for Ceph, but cephadm and the Ceph orchestrator have been a game changing in the way how operators interact with Ceph.
To streamline the deployment process, OpenStack services need to be configured to interact with Ceph but there is also a  need to bootstrap, configure and tune the Ceph cluster to meet the OpenStack workload.
An example is Manila, where the new ceph mgr interface enabled new drivers and simplified the existing use cases.
This talk will give an overview of the current state of the integration, and how projects in the OpenStack ecosystem changed and updated the reference architecture as a result of the introduction of cephadm and the Ceph orchestrator but also look towards at the Kubernetes integration, when a single Ceph cluster can be shared by OpenStack (rbd interface) and the Kubernetes workloads via pvc.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>SQL on Ceph</title>
        <subtitle>An introduction to the new libcephsqlite library.</subtitle>
        <track>Software Defined Storage</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ceph was originally designed to fill a need for a distributed file system
within scientific computing environments but has since grown to become a
dominant &lt;strong&gt;unified&lt;/strong&gt; software-defined distribute storage system. Today, it is
also notably used as an enterprise-quality block device and object store
provider. This talk will cover the new development of an SQLite Virtual File
System (VFS) on top of Ceph's distributed object store (RADOS). I will show how
SQL can now be run on Ceph for both its internal use and for new application
storage requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing storage abstractions on Ceph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very brief introduction to RADOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very brief introduction to SQLite and its VFS abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The libcephsqlite library and how it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use libcephsqlite in an application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Ceph uses libcephsqlite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Dynamic load change in SDS systems</title>
        <subtitle>How to make well behaved SDS systems in an ever changing cluster</subtitle>
        <track>Software Defined Storage</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation describes the new read (aka primary) balancer that is added to Ceph next version (Reef) and explains how the framework developed as part of this balancer for more sophisticated use cases. Specifically, it shows how you can use this framework and creates a policy that changes the SDS load dynamically so it can mitigate effects such as noisy neighbors and faulty network devices (NICs or ToR switch) without moving data around. This can be very useful when the effects described are temporary (for example noisy neighbor in hyper-converged environment)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The new balancer is based on a policy that defines the desired primary configuration and the engine that changes the configuration to meet the desired configuration (or at least be as close to it as possible). The engine is fast and involves no data movement (only metadata changes). As a result, it can be executed periodically over relatively short periods. Given this feature, anyone can write policies that react to changes in the cluster behavior in near real time. We will show some use cases and the logic to build policies that maximize the cluster performance for these use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will present SUSE's storage team's latest passion project, s3gw (https://s3gw.io), an easy-to-use S3-compatible service for kubernetes environments. Although focused to work on top of Longhorn (https://longhorn.io), s3gw can leverage any local filesystem or Persistent Volume provided to it. The project is divided in two main components: the s3gw service, a Ceph RADOS Gateway with a custom, filesystem based backend, leveraging RGW's SAL implementation; and the s3gw UI, not only for management tasks but also providing a bucket and object explorer.
During our time together we will discuss s3gw's backend implementation, and present the UI, with a small demonstration of how to deploy the project on a small kubernetes cluster. With this talk we would love to also gather feedback from the attendees, so we can feed back into project development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ceph RGW (RADOS Gateway) is an interface to Ceph, providing access to Ceph object storage using the industry standard S3 and Swift protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zipper is a project currently underway to provide a plug-in framework to utilize other storage solutions, e.g. an SQLite database, in addition to or instead of Ceph RADOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other related activities include adding LUA scripting, an Apache Arrow Flight front end, and pluggable, stackable filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will provide a high level overview of the overall Ceph architecture, and then drill in to the RGW architecture with the Zipper enhancements. We will do a deeper dive into the source and review the Zipper API that developers use to write a Zipper plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we are going to introduce you to the Rook Ceph Operator, which can be used to run Ceph clusters with ease on top of Kubernetes clusters. In helping make it easy to run a Rook Ceph cluster we will also be talking about the current state of the project development, the kubectl krew plugin and some more advanced features.
There will be a demo about the rook-ceph krew plugin on how it is used to automate common management tasks and can make the troubleshooting process easier.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AMENDMENT Autoscaling with KEDA - Object Store Case Study</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Software Defined Storage</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scaling your object store is complex and payloads vary in size - objects can be as large as virtual machine images or
as small as emails. In behaviour - some are mostly reading, writing, and listing objects. Other payloads delete
objects, and some keep them forever. Using CPU and RAM to autoscale the pods horizontally or vertically is limited
and may adversely affect the system. Treating our object store as a queueing system: converting HTTP
requests to actions on disks may be the solution!
Please note that this session was originally scheduled for 18:30.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we would show how we use KEDA and Prometheus to track the backlog of work in an object store system
orchestrated by Rook and to autoscale the object store pods based on different metrics. We show how autoscaling is
impacting the performance and resource utilization in the environment by taking Ceph’s object store frontend (the
RADOS Gateway daemon) as a use case.
We will demonstrate how to use KEDA and Prometheus to solve a scaling problem that cannot be quickly resolved by
the traditional HPA (horizontal pod autoscaling). We will show how the Rook operator orchestrates the different
parts of the system. Attendees will learn how to use cloud-native tools to perform autoscaling, better utilize
resources like CPU and I/O and increase the performance of their solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk has been cancelled.
A natural consequence of Software Defined Storage is that your software must operate on a wide variety of platforms that you, as a developer, have little control over. Therefore a big challenge can be to perform system inspection to help identify software and hardware bottlenecks and issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are dealing with customers who expect a large amount of confidentiality, how can you get detailed information on a system level? How do you provide system diagnosis that goes beyond “regular” Prometheus style monitoring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show the tools we have developed that allow our customers to validate and get instant status of their clusters. I will demonstrate how I and our other engineers can rapidly generate information about system setups and detailed metrics for assisting in setup and other support questions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>BSD Driver Harmony</title>
        <subtitle>Improving collaboration between the major BSDs on driver development</subtitle>
        <track>BSD</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The major BSD Operating Systems, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, tend to evolve independently from each other. However, they still share large parts of their respective vision and idioms - in other words, they have way more similarities than differences to each other. An important common requirement is to support a wide range of computer devices and equipment. Unfortunately, device drivers from a BSD system are usually not directly suitable for the others. The differences vary in different amounts depending on each subsystem, bus, kernel API, etc.
This presentation will illustrate the situation with a few examples, and work as a call for volunteers from every BSD project. The goal is to explore areas where more code can be shared among the different BSDs, with a focus on device drivers. Generally, good ideas deserve a chance to be visible across the different systems!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this presentation is to attempt to create a common effort, in any shape or form, in order to foster cooperation between the major BSD systems in terms of driver development in particular.
The ideal outcome of this presentation could be the creation of a committee and/or of a mailing-list - formal or informal - which could convene regularly and share the state of the development for each BSD, and identify areas where designs could converge towards easier code sharing of device drivers for instance.
I am myself involved with the NetBSD project (khorben@), member of the Board of the NetBSD Foundation, and would happily coordinate on that side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes ease of use and simplicity over flexibility.
Got uses Git repositories to store versioned data.
Got is being developed on OpenBSD and its main target audience are OpenBSD developers.
The -portable version of Got provides support for FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonflyBSD, Linux, and MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent addition to Got's tool suite is a daemon called gotd(8), which serves Git repositories over SSH connections.
This talks provides a short general introduction to Got and then presents the design of gotd(8), its usage, and details about its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reggae is built upon CBSD and uses it as a layer to create and configure jails and virtual machines, configure network and to some degree interact with firewall. Reggae also makes creating of development environment fast and easy. It enables developers to use jails or virtual machines for development so that the host system is not polluted with project dependencies. It supports different provisioners: shell, ansible, puppet, chef and salt stack. When not in development mode, Reggae makes maintaining of production easy with helper commands like provisioning already deployed jail. This talk will cover all features of Reggae and some features of CBSD and FreeBSD that make Reggae possible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 here at Fosdem, I publicly introduce a new port called pkg-provide, a pkg plugin to perform reverse searches and found the package you must install to have a certain file.
Started as a proof of concept about how to  build pkg plugin, pkg-plugin is now five years old and gain hundred of users around the world.
It's probably the perfect time to tell you how it all started, reveal the real numbers of the audience, and talk a little bit about the future&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Chimera Linux</title>
        <subtitle>A BSD/LLVM distro from scratch</subtitle>
        <track>BSD</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Chimera Linux is a new Linux distribution started in mid-2021. It's a general-purpose operating system based on binary packages that aims to be practical and clean, while addressing various shortcomings of an average Linux distro. One of the things making it unique is that it's a non-GNU distribution, utilizing a combination of userland utilities originating from FreeBSD, the LLVM/Clang toolchain and musl libc, besides other things. On top of that, it is not based on any existing distribution and comes with its own packaging infrastructure and various custom software that was needed to fill in the gaps. It's also highly portable, already supporting x86_64, POWER, AArch64 and RISC-V, with more possibly coming. In the presentation I will cover the progress made in the last year, as well as give a general overview of the system and what it takes to create a distro from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The distribution follows a rolling release model and by default uses the GNOME desktop with Wayland. The custom package building infrastructure was created after having learned from the shortcomings of equivalent systems in other distros, aiming to be flexible and fast, while emphasizing correctness and allowing for fully sandboxed, unprivileged builds. The result is binary packages/repositories for apk-tools, which Chimera uses as a frontend package manager. The build tooling can also bring the system up from source using a foreign musl-based distribution as a base, making it easily bootstrappable. The resulting repositories utilize LLVM's ThinLTO for nearly all packages, and special emphasis is also placed on security hardening (including CFI and others). Service management is based on the Dinit suite with a custom set of core services and is fully supervising, dependency-based and aims to provide practical parity with systemd, while remaining lean and grokkable (and most importantly, portable). A major aspect of the project is to also improve software portability across the stack, improving the state of matters for both Linux and the BSDs. We also aim to contribute code improvements back to FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, this is not any kind of dogmatic, niche effort. It's a system that tries to be pragmatic, providing a complete package that is polished and has well-defined defaults, while establishing its own identity and not being like something else. We also want to establish a community that is open and welcoming, without pointless elitism, and most importantly have fun doing all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up presentation to last year's FOSDEM, but I will try my best to make it standalone and as easy to understand as possible for the general audience. Some basic Linux administration knowledge may be necessary for some of the information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Demystifying compiler-rt-sanitizers for multiple architectures</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Compiler-rt is a set of runtime routines present in LLVM infrastructure to support and provide an implementation of various builtin functions for multiple architectures. It consists of – builtin libraries, sanitizer runtimes, profile runtimes, and block runtimes. This talk focuses on one of the compiler rt components- sanitizers. Compiler-rt sanitizers are used to perform runtime checks on compiled code. These checks can include detecting and preventing common programming errors, such as buffer overflows and memory leaks, as well as more sophisticated checks, such as undefined behavior sanitization, which can help detect and prevent subtle bugs that can be difficult to find using other methods. This talk will provide an introduction to compiler rt sanitizers in LLVM, and how to use them on various architectures starting with an example of memory sanitizer for x86 architecture. Second part of the talk will cover – how compiler-rt sanitizers can be used for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architecture and integrate in development and testing using Software development kit (SDK) built with Yocto. Also useful for the development of applications for memory-constrained embedded devices using clang and LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Defining a multi-architecture interface for SYCL in LLVM Clang</title>

        <track>LLVM</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We have been working to bring multi-architecture support using SYCL to the LLVM Clang project. Our original approach was to implement a "Plugin Interface" to add support for a PTX back-end and subsequently we have also added support for GCN enabling NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. This short presentation will outline our approach to designing this multi-architecture back-end and recent work to formalise the interface in the SYCL specification. This work is enabling researchers using the pre-exascale Perlmutter and Polaris supercomputers and exascale Summit supercomputer to write code using open standard SYCL and deploy on these machines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk has been cancelled as Nicolai is no longer able to attend FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLVM has a bunch of global state, which causes pains when using LLVM as a shared library from anything that looks like a plugin -- which includes drivers for OpenGL and Vulkan. This is a quick reminder and update on the removal of ManagedStatic and llvm_shutdown, whose goal is to reduce some of these pains.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about experiences organizing and going to LLVM socials around the world.
What do you get out of going to an LLVM social?
Would you like LLVM socials to be organized around where you live?
Could you start one yourself?
What are your experiences?
What do you think could be improved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this discussion slot replaces the lightning talk titled "Eliminating ManagedStatic and llvm_shutdown" that was due to have been given by Nicolai Hähnle, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend due to illness.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How to Build your own MLIR Dialect</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MLIR allows you to define your own intermediate representation (IR) while benefiting from the infrastructure it provides. However, getting started with creating your own IR, called dialect in the MLIR universe, is sometimes tricky. This tutorial addresses some of the challenges arising with the CMake configuration and explores projects like the standalone MLIR dialect example in more detail. Furthermore, we take a look at how TableGen files that define a single dialect can be split.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Even with tutorials on MLIR like the MLIR tutorial presented at the LLVM Developers' Meeting in 2020 [1] and the "Creating a Dialect" [2] as well as the Toy tutorial [3] in the MLIR docs, building an MLIR dialect can feel difficult. This can be especially the case when it comes to the CMake configuration. Good starting points are the standalone MLIR dialect example [4] and especially the tutorial [5] given by S. Neuendorffer at last years LLVM Developers' Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the existing tutorials, we will look into the details of the CMake configuration of an out-of-tree dialect like [4]. Furthermore, we dive into more complex CMake configurations for projects like MLIR-EmitC [6], showing how to build a project standalone or embedded into another project. In addition to the CMake configuration, it is briefly covered how to architecture TableGen files. In particular, it is shown how to use multiple TableGen files to define a single dialect, e.g. to define the base dialect, operations, attributes and types.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Case study of creating and maintaining an analysis and instrumentation tool based on LLVM: PARCOACH</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PARCOACH is a static and dynamic analysis tool for High Performance Computing applications (using MPI and OpenMP for instance), based on LLVM.
Its main purpose is to check that the APIs usage are correct (for instance that all processus or threads call a barrier to avoid a deadlock).
It's not always possible to detect all errors statically, therefore the static analysis can be complemented by a dynamic instrumentation of the code to perform some correctness checks during the code execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This (out-of-tree) tool has been initially written based on LLVM 3.7, and is now based on LLVM 15.
As a research project, it has seen a lot of contributions: from PhD students, from interns, and from researchers; with actually a low number of LLVM-specific engineers working on it until recently.
The objective of the talk would be to focus on how the project has been using LLVM over the years (and how it's been maintained):
  - how the lack of maintainance had lead to a relatively high technical dept.
  - how LLVM tools and structure had been used: from a manual compilation of the code to "properly" using LLVM's CMake integration, from analysis code tangled in the transformation code to properly using the "new" analysis and passes manager.
  - how the CI/CD evolved to improve the user experience (eg: docker-based jobs, automated images and packages generation, docker-compose entry point).
  - the weaknesses remaining in the project (as far as LLVM is concerned), where they come from, and the plan to fix them.
  - and obviously take a look at some mistakes that have been done (trying to maintain compatibility with several LLVM versions at once just to name one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the content of the talk would not be "new" from a scientific point of view, we believe it would provide some interesting take-aways for people looking into developing or maintaining out-of-tree LLVM-based software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk shows the evolution of the C2 programming language. It also shows how to build/evolve your own compiler in a generic way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Building your own compiler is a daunting task. But more and more people do give it a try nowadays. One factor of this is the availability of LLVM. LLVM is a generic compiler back-end, that saves you from having to generate Assembly code. The only problem now is how to generate LLVM code..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Flang is the new Fortran frontend of LLVM. While the frontend is not yet ready for general use, significant progress has been made. In this talk I summarise the progress that has been achieved and the major development thrusts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flang supports compilation of most of Fortran 95. Significant progress is being made on Fortran 2003 features. Flang can compile Spec and other important benchmarks. Some work has been done to improve performance. Further work is under way, this includes Alias Analysis, improved codegen for Array Expressions and Assumed shape arrays. A new dialect called HLFIR (High Level FIR) is also under construction. This dialect will capture more higher level Fortran info in the IR. Flang is mostly OpenMP 1.1 compliant. Significant progress has been made with the Driver as well. The presentation will cover these points.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Open source C/C++ embedded toolchains using LLVM</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open-source tools based on LLVM that target rich software platforms such as Linux are in widespread use. A large proportion of the investment in upstream LLVM development is targeted at this use case. There is much less use of open-source C/C++ toolchains for embedded software development, with GCC toolchains being dominant. This can be explained by a number of factors:
* Assembling an embedded toolchain is complicated, due to cross-compilation and missing components such as the C-library.
* Differences in the toolchain interface and missing functionality compared to GCC.
* Code-size and performance gaps on embedded targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are efforts in the LLVM community to improve the suitability for embedded software development. This presentation will cover some of the gaps and what we are trying to do to fill them. Specifically:
* Hosted versus embedded toolchains.
* Why do we want to use LLVM for an embedded toolchain?
* What components make up an embedded toolchain, and which of these can be supplied by the LLVM project.
* The LLVM bare metal driver.
* A comparison of a LLVM based toolchain against an equivalent GNU toolchain.
* Work that is being done in the community to improve embedded development.
* How to get involved!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation does not require any in depth knowledge of LLVM or compilers. An awareness of the components of a toolchain such as compiler, linker and libraries will be helpful. The toolchains used for comparison are the LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm and the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of LLVM community meet-ups, including the Monthly LLVM Embedded Toolchains call are available at https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>Railways and Open Transport</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the last years, SBB has developed a binary data format, based on the open standard HDF5. We call this format Rail Condition Monitoring Data Exchange, or short RCM-DX. We already decided to set this format Open Source. In parallel, SBB has developed a Viewing software for this data format, called RCM-DX Viewer. We are in the process to also set Open Source this viewing software as well as a Java and C# Library that can read and write RCM-DX directly. The SBB is hoping to attract a community for those tools in order to have a free and open standard format for measuring data in the rail infrastructure domain. In an ideal world, in future a railway company can mention this format in an open tender and thus ensure, that data produced is open and readable. Also a new company, creating a new measurement system can rely on this viewing software and data format and thus lower its initial amount of work to enter the market. We would like to show our current state and let the world see where those components can be obtained&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>Railways and Open Transport</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MOTIS is a modular mobility platform that was released as Open Source in May 2020. It's main functionality is its high performance door to door routing. However, MOTIS comes with "batteries included" and provides additional modules for input (e.g. auto-complete for station names and addresses) and output (embedded map tile server, departure and arrival tables, vehicle locations, etc.) as well as an Android app and web user interface (all open source). MOTIS offers a JSON-API via HTTP(S). It reads timetables in GTFS and can update its data model with GTFS-RT. Our current focus is the profile-based computation of fully accessible routes for people with disabilities as well as the implementation of a data model and algorithms that can efficiently work with timetables of arbitrary length.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Using travel survey data, we have a genetic algorithm that can optimise your network, reducing overall transit time for users, while keeping your constraints fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will present the various features of the platform, with examples from actual cities, describe our routing infrastructure, show where we are hoping to go and touch the topic of OSM data quality and the data require for best analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of a project who started in the depth of a research lab and graduated to be used outside of it. The development was done in collaboration with planners from various transit agencies, which insure that the features are useful to users. We could tell many stories about the challenges of bringing code from the research labs out to the real world, we'll touch on some, time permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developped our routing engine for transit purpose, trRouting. We also build on top of OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digitransit is an open-source public transportation project which consists of microservices created within the Digitransit project and use of existing open-source projects. Digitransit was originally created in Finland to replace existing nation-wide and regional journey planning solutions in 2014. Digitransit has since been used around the world in smaller and larger projects, for example in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will discuss and demonstrate what Digitransit is and what are the future plans for the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenTripPlanner is an open source journey planning framework with over 10 years of history. It is constantly evolving, with the version 2.0, including an entirely revamped transit routing algorithm, Multi-Criteria Range-RAPTOR with Destination Pruning, released in the end of 2020. The new algorithm makes it possible to support large national and international deployments. Currently, it powers the national journey planners in multiple countries, including Norway and Finland. At Entur it is used as a basis for systems ranging from ticket sales to physical departure boards at railway stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will take a quick look into the history of OpenTripPlanner, where does it come from, and how has it evolved over the years. We will take a closer look at the recently released OpenTripPlanner version 2.3 and its new features, as well as a look on the roadmap of which functionality will be coming in the next releases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Developing open transport toolbox and community for ten years</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For ten years i'm involved in Public transport digital services (especially traveler information, trip planner, Mobility as a Service at Hove and now i'm the SNCF open data platform coordinator). I'm an Open transport advocate working for SNCF Group and organising Open Transport meetups, mainly in France, being also part of initatives who works on commons like Fabrique des mobilités or OpenStreetMap. As i was part of the team when we opened Navitia trip planner source code and decided to have an open based strategy step by step (transport open data / open source / open API and SDK), i had the chance to be at the center of this great adventure at Hove, connecting with Navitia reusers an contributors, developing links with Open transport community.
As open transport also means open innovation, it's important to work on developer's experience to facilitate either the integration of Navitia (open source) or the development of innovative services with Navitia Playgroung (Navitia API console).
I propose to have a look in the rear view mirror, either the successes, showing concrete use cases from different sectors (mobility, tourism, real estate, employment), Navitia's reusers and contributers,... or some difficulties (long is the road), what are the next steps in the transport industry, with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Public Transport Data in KDE Itinerary</title>
        <subtitle>Querying realtime journey data and dissecting ticket barcodes</subtitle>
        <track>Railways and Open Transport</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;KDE's digital travel assistance app Itinerary consumes public transport data in various ways, from journey queries over realtime disruption information and coach layouts to tickets. In this talk we'll look at what has been implemented for this and what is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;KDE Itinerary supports you on the road by presenting all relevant travel dates and documents in a timeline, with all its content being automatically extracted from flight, train and bus tickets, hotel reservations or event tickets. Unlike with proprietary alternatives, all of this happens on the user's device and under the user's control. Itinerary can then augment this with realtime information about disruptions and suggest public transport options to get from the station to the hotel for example. For connections in complex train stations Itinerary also provides OSM-based indoor maps including the realtime operational status of elevators where available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support the travel data extraction from tickets, decoding several standard and proprietary ticket barcode formats has been implemented. Besides UIC 918.3 and ERA SSB/TLB this as of recently also includes the rather complex new European international ticket standard "Flexible Content Barcode" (FCB). For a few proprietary barcodes we are still struggling with reverse engineering and/or finding the corresponding documentation though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For querying public transport journeys and disruption information several open and proprietary backends are supported, such as Navitia, OpenTripPlanner, OpenJourneyPlanner/TRIAS, Hafas and EFA. The focus here is on unified access to common information rather than to support every possible detail and journey customization option. One still missing but particularly difficult to model piece of information however are prices and tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 80 currently supported online services, automating discovering and managing information about those also becomes relevant. We will look at the Transport API Repository project as well as Itinerary's approach of adding line and product metadata from OSM and Wikidata for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realtime data of the operational status of elevators and escalators or the train coach layout at a given platform are also supported, but unfortunately not as widely available. This tends to be particularly relevant information for users with mobility restrictions though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Accurate description of the railway network as always been a key resource to manage train circulations. To solve common problems of operation simulation requires a great amount of data of high quality.
Unfortunately, open data published by infrastructure managers in Europe is not meeting expectations: poor documentation, no information on data quality, low frequency updates, missing data, heterogeneous coverage…
In this talk, we will compare current railway network data availability and quality on OpenStreetMap and on company-owned open data platforms of several European countries. Based on this analysis, we will issue usage recommendations for open-source projects needing to use railway network description data. Then, we will share perspectives on the evolution of these data sources on the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate description of the railway network as always been a key resource to manage train circulations. To solve common problems of operation simulation requires a great amount of data of high quality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Comprehensive geometry (length, incline, curve) and topology of tracks, including switches and crossings and of passing points (stations, points of interest); 

Circulation restrictions, associated to tracks (speed limit, track vacancy detection, electrification, loading gauge); 

Rolling stock (power, size, weight, contents). 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, this data has been created and maintained by rail infrastructure managers, to construct the timetable, sell train paths to transporters and maintain the infrastructure. The strategic nature of the data has been reassessed these last years, as open data regulation evolved in Europe (public money = public data), compelling infrastructure managers to publish some of their data. Open data supports innovative product emergence inside and outside of the company, and is a requirement on open-source projects, to allow collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, published data is not meeting expectations: poor documentation, no information on data quality, low frequency updates, missing data, heterogeneous coverage…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, since 2007 on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, a collaborative geographic database of the world, volunteers have mapped the European railway network with great accuracy, using mainly aerial imagery and field knowledge provided by railway enthusiasts. Because of its overall quality, coverage, and easy access, projects started to use OSM data instead of company-provided open data (OpenRailwayMap, OpenRailRouting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using OSM data has many advantages: public and decentralized (anyone can access, at any time), constantly updated with detailed metadata, world coverage, easy updating of incorrect data, data model flexibility allowing new usages, powerful open-source tools to edit and ascertain data quality, protective license (OdBL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are still many challenges to address: integrating company-sourced open data in OSM while respecting the community work (and as so, challenging the ownership of the data as a data producer), establishing public data quality reports, integrating real-time and non-geographic data (such as rolling stocks) that cannot be published on OSM, work with other users to ensure the data model and data quality suits every use, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will compare current railway network data availability and quality on OpenStreetMap and on company-owned open data platforms of several European countries. Based on this analysis, we will issue usage recommendations for open-source projects needing to use railway network description data. Then, we will share perspectives on the evolution of these data sources on the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It's the fall of 2021. Bidirectional charging (V2G) is a tech buzzword, but even all those EV owners whose cars support V2G have to wait for the industry to offer them optimal and automated operation.
All of them? No. A small but growing group of Nissan Leaf owners are not waiting, but install a stack of open technologies in their home and live the new energy future.
This talk will explain how HomeAssistant, FlexMeasures and NextCloud were put together to take a step into the future. In open source, we should build combined solutions from strong existing tools more often!
We'll look at one year of data and discuss what could happen next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Vehicle-to-grid charging (V2G), also referred to as bidirectional charging, means your car battery is not only drawing power from the grid, but might also discharge (back) into the grid.
The consequences for the power system are highly consequential, but also from the user perspective: You can save a lot of money if you use your own solar power or use dynamic tariffs.
Yet, commercial vendors are slow to offer optimized charging to households, let alone V2G. There are reasons for this, but we set out to show that they are not fundamentally technical.
While the industry world is dragging their feet, the power and maturity of open source allowed us to put together an open stack to allow cost-optimized and automated bidirectional charging at home, with a user-friendly UX design built on top, as well. We used strong, existing tools, and added a thin application layer (a HomeAssistant plugin). This design approach should be on the table more often in the open-source community.
We will explain the design of this stack, as well as the data we collected and potential monetary benefits for the user.
At the moment, the stack is rolled out at the homes of other enthusiastic front-runners. This will make sure the solution becomes more mature and makes steps to scalability. As industry is also dragging their feet on supporting the OCPP protocol, we can only support one charger right now, the Wallbox Qasar, but there is no technical limit to supporting other bidirectional chargers. We are curious if others are interested to support more chargers, and make the stack even easier to install and monitor.
Soon, the commercial world will roll out more bidirectional chargers and cars (we use the Nissan Leaf), as well as home energy management solutions which lock users into specific vendor relationships (where the car is just one of the managed services). It's crucial to provide an open-source alternative, to provide independence for users, and to inspire startups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The energy transition poses new challenges to all parties in the energy sector. For grid operators, the rise in renewable energy and electrification of energy consumption leads to the capacity of the grid to near its physical constraints. Forecasting the load on the grid in the next hours to days is essential for anticipating on local congestion and making the most of existing assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open source package OpenSTEF provides a complete software stack which forecasts the load on the electricity grid for the next hours to days. Given a timeseries of measured (net) load or generation, a fully automated machine learning pipeline is executed which delivers a probabilistic forecast of future load. This works for energy consumption, (renewable) generation or a combination of both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this presentation, we will show how we have implemented this opensource tooling at the Dutch Distribution System Operator Alliander to fully automate forecasting the load on the grid.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is about my personal story and experiences around energy use cases at home, which I have mainly realized with the smart home software openHAB.
It starts with energy monitoring of the smart home from electricity to heating and room temperatures and goes on to tracking a photovoltaic system and managing its surplus production, e.g. for charging an electric vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the technical use-cases, we will also have a look at environmental impact and the potential cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digital technology is a major contributor to environmental harm, whether it is the 'tsunami' of e-waste filling landfills or the CO2 emissions on a par with the aviation industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oft overlooked is that software plays a crucial role. For instance, software bloat means less powerful hardware may stop working and end up as toxic waste in landfills, while new devices are manufactured unnecessarily -- the production of which often costs more energy than usage over their operating life. Moreover, software bloat also entails that the software will have higher energy demands and pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- in order to achieve the same result. Digital sustainability is, in many ways, a question of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Angel ecolabel, the official environmental label of the German government, began certifying software in 2020. In the award criteria, sustainability is closely linked with transparency and user autonomy. This connection has been one of the motivations behind the KDE Eco initiative since its beginning in 2021. In this talk I will present the environmental harm driven by software, with a focus on energy consumption. I will link the values of Free and Open Source software to sustainable software design. Finally, I will provide an overview of the work of the KDE Eco project and the new sustainability goals of KDE.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Getting to a fossil free internet by 2030</title>
        <subtitle>A tour of the tech and policy changes to get us there</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the idea of a carbon aware, fossil free internet by 2030, has become more than just interesting idea, and instead something that is socially and economically plausible, as well as desirable and inline with the latest climate science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll cover some of the key drivers to make this possible, and what key policy changes can accelerate our transition from fossil fuels in the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover some of the most promising ideas from the Internet Architecture Board’s recent workshops to explore how to reduce global ICT emissions inline with the science around staying within 1.5 degrees of warming. We'll give an overview of how new open source software like Ecovisors can do for on-site power what hypervisors have done for virtualisation of computing, how carbon-aware Computing schedulers and carbon aware networking routers can lead to an internet that can complement a shift to a grid powered by more variable renewable sources of energy, and we will also cover how a shift to hourly carbon accounting for electricity with new standards like Energy Tag’s Granular Certificates can cut through existing greenwash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll talk about some of the the regulatory drivers on the horizon can help technologists argue for more ambitious climate action, from the European Corporate Social Responsibility Directive to recent changes in international accounting standards from the IFRS (international financial reporting standards) Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will leave with a good grounding of the progress made in the Greening of IT, the challenges facing us for the rest of the decade, and better idea of their role in the coming energy transition, particularly in the tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Support for power profiling was recently added to the Firefox Profiler, enabling both Firefox engineers and web developers to get very precise measurements of the power consummed by running their code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a brief introduction to the Firefox Profiler, the presentation will explain how this power profiling feature works, where the data comes from, what the limitations are on the various platforms.
Interesting things that could be measured on Firefox will be shown, and some surprising profiling results will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Update on open-source energy system modeling in the global south and including Africa</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Energy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A number of open‑source energy system models are now active in the global south and this presentation provides an update.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy system models are simulations of future energy systems that can be used to test scenarios. More specifically, such models can explore a range of net‑zero options in an integrated fashion, determine which scenarios are feasible, and then report on system development trajectories, detailed and aggregate costs, and related attributes for further consideration. Many of the underlying modeling frameworks are now fully‑fledged open‑source projects.  In addition, there are several nascent initiatives to develop coherent databanks and also the overarching data standards they require, with both endeavors suitably open licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various efforts are now starting to spill into the global south generally and sub‑Saharan Africa in particular. A number of potential benefits then arise from this kind of open analysis.  The first is the zero monetary cost of course.  The next is organic knowledge transfer both northward and southward within the various project communities. A third is doubtless that a greater range of scenarios will be placed on the table — indeed I sense that the multilateral agencies working in Africa have settled on a selected set of solutions and that suggestions that fall outside the prevailing orthodoxy are unwarranted and unwanted. A fourth potential advantage is local engagement, and further, the prospects of improved local autonomy — and while there are no examples of model‑mediated public processes in the global south as yet, that concept is being trialed in the global north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of open analysis in the global south will offer distinctive challenges nonetheless.  The most obvious difficulty is data availability and a number of proxy solutions have been developed.  The next is how best to channel these efforts into public policy formation and then on to live projects.  Also critical will be the necessity of finding new ways of interacting between official agencies and these clearly informal modeling communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the leading open‑source framework projects, OSeMOSYS and PyPSA, have begun significant efforts to broaden into the global south.  These two initiative will be reviewed (I am not directly involved in either).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly early days still but sufficient progress has been made to warrant an update at FOSDEM'23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open-source tools for energy applications are growing in quality and number but their adoption still lacks behind. In the talk, an overview of the current status on features provided by open-source tools compared to their in-house counterparts, and possible synergies to foster open-source adoption using a community approach. Practical examples by the PyPSA and PyPSA meets Earth initiative for global energy planning will be discussed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy transition is a major challenge that no one can tackle alone. Collaboration across national boundaries and sectors and within civil society is necessary and open data and open-source software are promising tools to identify costs and opportunities and accelerate the uptake of net‑zero technologies, especially in developing countries where resources are often scarce. However, except for few notable institutions, in-house software and data dominate industry and policy decision making in energy matter.
Many large entities have been historically reluctant to use open-source software and open data, for concerns including data quality, technical support on open tools, lack of features, or reliability of results.  Nevertheless, the open community has been developing several tools for various energy applications, which can meet many needs by utilities, policy makers and industry. However, despite the open-source alternative, often closed software is still the standard approach.
The presentation will describe the status of open data and open-source tools adoption in the energy sector will be discussed, including a proposal on how to fill the missing steps using community of communities: open-source communities shall help each other towards practical adoption. Focus will be given on the comparison of features provided by selected in-house models and the open-source counterpart, including the examples by PyPSA and PyPSA meets Earth initiatives that actively promote open data and open-source tools for global energy planning. The initiatives have demonstrated that fully open energy modelling, from the data till the solver, is already possible at Continental scale with reasonable accuracy, even in areas where data access is generally more difficult, such as at African level. In conclusion, the major lessons learnt from open energy modelling initiatives will be drawn, highlighting synergies among open-source communities to foster adoption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As of October 2022, we run a 15 minutes fuzzing session for all Pull Requests submitted to the Virtio Device implementation in rust-vmm. But implementing the fuzz targets was not smooth sailing. In this talk, we go over the challenges of implementing fuzzing for Virtio Devices and how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Being one of the most critical components in a virtualization stack, the Virtio Device Model is a great target for fuzzing. Fuzzing is a security focused testing technique through which you can discover vulnerabilities in code that deals with untrusted input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When fuzzing Virtio Devices one of the biggest challenges is mocking the device-driver communication. This talk will show how we approached this in rust-vmm, and why fuzzing should be taken into consideration from the early development stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Is OpenStack still needed in 2023?</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 years, OpenStack has become the de-facto standard for providing cloud infrastructure using open source solutions. But in the past 6 years, the ecosystem focus has shifted higher in the stack onto cloud-native solutions, which run on top of an existing cloud infrastructure. Does that mean that open source cloud infrastructure solutions, like OpenStack, are no longer relevant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Thierry Carrez, the General Manager for the Open Infrastructure Foundation, the non-profit hosting the OpenStack project, will explore this question. After examining the motivation and history of OpenStack over the past decade, we will explore what makes OpenStack relevant in the next decade, with a special attention to the European context. While it is not for everyone, new use cases like Digital Sovereignty or Edge computing are driving renewed adoption of OpenStack, especially in combination with Kubernetes (what is called the Linux OpenStack Kubernetes Infrastructure, or LOKI).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Using SPDK with the Xen hypervisor</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present our usage of SPDK, Storage Performance Development Kit,

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present our usage of SPDK, Storage Performance Development Kit,
with the Xen hypervisor and discuss memory sharing mechanisms in hypervisors
from a security and performance perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPDK is a userspace NVMe driver allowing access to these types of storage
devices with minimal overhead from the operating system. It allows you to
maximize the performance usage of new storage technologies, as well as having faster
development times of applications serving IO because of the easier development
cycle of running in userspace. In our case, we use it as a storage backend
for virtual machines where an SPDK application establishes a connection with
virtual machines through shared memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sharing of memory, in a virtualized environment, gives access to the
outside world to a virtual machine. In the case of Xen, the sharing mechanism,
called Grant Table, uses the hypervisor as a trusted intermediary to allow
sharing memory with another virtual machine. The backend doing device
multiplexing only get access to areas explicitely permitted by the frontend.
This permits the guest to not completely trust the storage provider software
with complete access to private memory, but the extra security of this model
doesn't come for free. We would like to discuss improvements that could be
added that would still keep the security aims of the Grant Table mechanism
while providing a high performance interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;OKD Virtualization is the community project bringing traditional virtualization technology into OKD.
OKD is an Open Source Community Distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployments. OKD is a sibling community distribution to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
OKD Virtualization is built on top of the KubeVirt project and its sibling operators.
The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator project ensures an opinionated and robust deployment automating common Day-1 (installation, configuration, etc.) and Day-2 (re-configuration, failover, etc.) operations.
The Hyperconverged Cluster Operator is available in the Openshift Community Operators catalog and so also on your OKD cluster.
In this session you will learn about fresh OKD Virtualization features like:
- Deploying a single node development/testing environment on CodeReady Containers (with nested virtualization) on your laptop
- Using KubeVirt Tekton tasks to automate VM common tasks (creating/copying VMs, generating ssh keys, executing commands into a VM or manipulating disks with libguestfs tools) in a CI/CD fashion
- Automatic importing and updating of pre-defined or custom boot sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this session newcomers will know what OKD Virtualization is while experienced users will get a sneak peek of new and upcoming features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The past few years have seen the emergence of yet another Virtio device, extending the aforementioned virtualization protocol to hardware video accelerators in V4L2. The upcoming Virtio Video driver conforms to the memory-to-memory stateful interface and draws upon a mature ecosystem to speed up media workflows in a guest OS by tapping into the host's hardware. In doing so, it is a step further in the general direction of establishing a de-facto standard for media handling in different hypervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk goes over the upcoming VA-API virtio video decoder backend currently in the works for the CrosVM hypervisor. It explains how the flexibility of Virtio technology can be paired with a very established API in order to produce a robust solution in video decoding virtualization, effectively blending the worlds of stateful and stateless interfaces. It details how the community at large stands to benefit from it and how it both validates and helps propel the development of the work-in-progress virtio video protocol itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will also cover the latest developments in the work in progress VirtIO Video protocol and delve in the architecture of cros-codecs, which is a project that aims to offer video decoding capabilities to the Rust ecosystem as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>blkhash - fast disk image checksums</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using checksums for verifying disk image download is very common, but how do you verify uploading a disk image to a virtual disk or verify that a backup is correct? The standard tools such as sha256sum cannot help since the disk image and the virtual disk may use different image formats. Even if the image formats match, standard tools are too slow to handle huge virtual disks which typically contain a small amount of data and a large amount of unallocated space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will learn about the &lt;code&gt;blkhash&lt;/code&gt; algorithm for computing a fast checksum of sparse disk images, up to  3 orders of magnitude faster compared with standard algorithms, the &lt;code&gt;libblkhash&lt;/code&gt; C library that you can use in your program, and the &lt;code&gt;blksum&lt;/code&gt; command line tool for computing checksum of common disk image formats.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The blkhash project grew from the ovirt-imageio project, providing fast disk checksums since oVirt 4.4. The blkhash project adds support for multiple threads, uses the high performance libnbd library, and is implemented in C. The project is released under LGPL license so you can use it in your project or package it for your distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Overview of (un)reliable methods for vNIC to network mapping with KubeVirt</subtitle>
        <track>Virtualization and IaaS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With a VM attached to multiple networks, it may become difficult and sometimes impossible for its workload to recognize which interface is connected to which network. In this presentation, we will cover various vNIC to network mapping options, their advantages and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The traditional interface naming scheme (eth0, eth1) does not play well when multiple network devices are present in a system. The names are dependent on the device detection order, which makes them unreliable over reboots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern OS have started using predictable naming schemes for some time now, making the traditional naming scheme a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KubeVirt [1] provides several options that allow to reliably map vNICs to networks in guests:
- Based on MAC address.
- Based on the PCI address.
- Based on the ACPI index.
- Based on the device-role-tagging [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we will use KubeVirt as an example, note that these methods are applicable to other platforms too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior familiarity with virtualization and basics of networking are recommended.
The audience will walk out knowing how to use the various network mapping methods and understand their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A journey through supporting VMs with dedicated CPUs on Kubernetes</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the Kubernetes resource allocation model, abstract concepts like resource request and limits, container QoS (quality of service), etc are being used. These concepts are eventually being converted under the hood to cgroup configurations, which have their own resource management model and concepts like CPU shares, CFS quotas, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of Kubevirt, an add-on to Kubernetes to allow running cloud-native VMs alongside containers, this information is crucial. In fact, our own “Cgroup Manager” was implemented to mutate and configure the container cgroups that are being defined to us by Kubernetes. One especially interesting challenge was to support a true CPU Pinning for VMs running on top of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will take you through our journey to support true dedicated CPUs for VMs. I hope that after taking part in this presentation, the audience will better understand Kubernetes and Cgroup resource allocation models and how they can be further utilized in the future. In addition, I wish that the info presented here will improve the collaboration between different technologies in the ecosystem like Cgroups, KVM, libvirt, Kubevirt and Kubernetes by raising awareness to how they all interact together in different and interesting use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>GNU Guix and Open science, a crush?</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix is our beloved reproducible software deployment toolbox.  It is a package manager also able to create isolated computational environments.  It is even able to produce pack containers.  Or, it can be a complete system.  In addition of focusing on reproducibility, it provides some key features as roll-back, declarative configuration, or time-machine, to name some.  GNU Guix respects the four essential freedoms: run the program as you wish; study how the program works and change it for computing as you wish; share copies for helping others; distribute modified versions for improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open science considers that scientific practices must be more open, transparent, collaborative and inclusive, coupled with more accessible and verifiable scientific knowledge subject to scrutiny and critique.  Such enterprise will improve the quality, reproducibility and impact of science, and thereby the reliability of the evidence needed for robust decision-making and policy and increased trust in science.  Quoting UNESCO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, Guix and Open science seems so well matched.  This presentation is an attempt to illustrate how the Guix project is helping Open science.  We emphasize two features of Guix that implement Open science principles: transparent and long-term.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How Replicant, a 100% free software Android distribution, uses (or doesn't use) Guix</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Guix is a 100% free software distribution that can be used in a wide variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other GNU/Linux distributions, all its packages and configuration is defined in scheme (with Guile). To do that it uses software abstractions. That abstraction enables to reuse the same packages or configurations in various contexts (for instance to build container, to build packages for other distributions, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This re-usability can enables other project to use Guix in various ways (for testing, for project infrastructure, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at how and why Replicant (a 100% free software Android distribution certified by the FSF) uses or depends on Guix, where it didn't use Guix and why, and future directions with the usage of Guix by the Replicant project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will mostly be about real life usage of Guix from the point of view of another software project (here an Android distribution). It will therefor show both advantages and limitations of Guix in that context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also have the necessary background information on Replicant and Guix (if it wasn't already presented in another presentation before).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Exploring WebAssembly with Forth (and vice versa)</title>
        <subtitle>Artisanal, minimal, just-in-time compilation for the web and beyond</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Forth is an extremely minimalistic yet powerful language. Its minimalism has historically made it the language of choice to explore and directly interact with the lowest levels of systems, traditionally the hardware. However, you can also use Forth to explore the low levels of the web platform: WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll dive into the details of WAForth, a tiny but complete Forth interpreter and dynamic compiler for and written in WebAssembly. You’ll see some Forth in action, read hand-written WebAssembly code, get introduced to tools used for working with WebAssembly, hear about JIT compilation for WebAssembly, and learn how you can move all this outside the web platform into native code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Whippet: A new production embeddable garbage collector</title>
        <subtitle>Replacing Guile's engine while the car is running</subtitle>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Guile has a new garbage collector coming!  The Whippet collector improve throughput and scalability of Guile programs, and is built in such a way that it can be swapped into most any language runtime that uses that BDW-GC.  With minimal adaptations in user code, you get a collector that's competitive with the industry-standard Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative collector, but which scales better for multiple allocation threads.  As incremental changes are made in Guile to integrate Whippet, we will also gain the ability to compact the heap, even while keeping conservative scanning of the C stack.  This talk presents the structure of whippet and some performance numbers for how it improves Guile program behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Whippet garbage collector provides an abstract interface that user programs (like Guile) can use to allocate memory, and also provides a number of collectors that implement that API.  One of them is the BDW-GC collector: this will be the first step in Guile's switch to Whippet, to change to use the Whippet API but keep the same GC implementation.  Compile-time flags choose the collector implementation, and in the next step, Guile will switch over to Whippet's main collector, an Immix-derived mark-region collector.  This collector has a few modes, including a heap-conservative mode that mimics BDW-GC, as well as a stack-conservative mode that allows evacuation and compaction of objects that aren't referenced by conservative roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will include a quick overview of Immix-style collectors, for context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whippet scales: it has been carefully designed to avoid contention during allocation, and avoid locking except during collection.  Collection is optionally parallel and optionally generational.  We'll examine the performance and practical impacts of these choices, in synthetic test harnesses and in real Guile programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whippet is designed to be included into a user's C source code, as it needs compile-time configuration.  The talk will show examples of the size of the collector and its memory efficiency when compared to BDW-GC and to a semispace collector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Zig is a minimalistic new language that is unapologetically focused on performance, tellingly with a blazingly fast compiler. It is advertised as a replacement for Thompson, Ritchie, and Kernighan's C, but it may even replace C++ in places.  Zig uses the C-ABI and does not do garbage collection, so it is ideal for binding against other languages, such as C, Python, Ruby etc. In this talk I will present combining GNU Guile with zig. I'll argue that everyone needs two languages: one for performance and one for quick coding. With Zig and Guile you can use both at the same time and you won't have to fight the Rust borrow checker either.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Algebraic Effects and Types as First-Class Features in the Fuzion Language</title>
        <subtitle>Giving a pure functional solution for non-functional aspects.</subtitle>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
found in functional and object-oriented programming languages.  It combines a
powerful syntax and safety features with a simple intermediate representation
that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis tools to verify
correctness aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since FOSDEM 2022, Fuzion has seen two major improvements: The introduction of
Algebraic Effects and a unification of types parameters and argument fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-effects of functions are hard to model in a purely functional way, while
object-oriented languages typically allow code to have arbitrary side effects.
Algebraic Effects were introduced to Fuzion to help track and control
side-effects of features.  But there is much more: Algebraic Effects provide a
clean mechanism to provide mutable state, to share global data, to provide an
exception mechanism and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Fuzion now treats type parameters like argument fields that receive types
as their values.  Types themselves may define inner features creating a
hierarchy parallel to the hierarchy of Fuzion features. This permits type
parameters to provide operations such as constructing instances of a parametric
type. This talk will show how this can be used to provide functionality such as
abstract equality in a clean an consistent way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion is a new functional and object-oriented language that aims at unifying
different concepts to reduce the complexity of the language and tools processing
code written in Fuzion.  The biggest difference between functional and
object-oriented languages is the handling of side-effects: In an ideal
functional world, all functions are pure, i.e., free from side-effects, while in
object-oriented languages like Java it is common to make frequent use of side
effects, e.g. a Java method to read data would usually be a function &lt;em&gt;read()&lt;/em&gt;
that would return the read data and have the side-effect of advancing the
current position in the input to the next element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Side Effects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-effects may come in very different forms: I/O operations that interact with
the outside world are just one example, other side effects are access or
modification of global state, program termination or early abortion of some
operation (e.g., via throwing an exception), logging, thread interactions,
yielding data to a co-routines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Algebraic Effects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An algebraic effect is a set of operations that provide a certain functionality
that may include side-effects.  The idea is that any function that requires such
an operations must do this explicitly, static that it depends on the
corresponding effect.  Any caller of a function that requires a certain
algebraic effect either itself requires that same effect, or it must provide a
handler that implements that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, say a function &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; performs some logging operation, so it
requires a &lt;em&gt;logger&lt;/em&gt; effect that has an operation &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; that adds one line of
logging data.  Any caller &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; therefore also depends on the &lt;em&gt;logger&lt;/em&gt;
effect, unless &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; itself would provide an implementation of the &lt;em&gt;logger&lt;/em&gt; effect
to be used by &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;.  If &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;, e.g., provides a no-op &lt;em&gt;logger&lt;/em&gt; implementation that
does nothing in its &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; operation, then &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; could be pure and not depend on an
effect, all the logging information created by &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; would be ignored.  If,
however, &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; would provide a logger that writes the log messages to a file, then
&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; would no longer require the &lt;em&gt;logger&lt;/em&gt; effect, but instead require some file-I/O
related effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations of an algebraic effect usually return a result, but they may also
abort the current calculation and directly return the the place the effect was
installed.  This makes effects somewhat similar to exception handling in some
languages. But effects are more general, an operation of an effect may resume
(return) an arbitrary number of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Type Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type parameters or generic types are common in many languages.  Usually, type
parameters are treated completely separately from normal 'value' parameters.  In
Fuzion, this distinction has been removed, type parameters are treated like
value arguments only that the their actual value is a type.  This permits adding
functionality to types and performing operations on types such as creating an
value of a given type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Fuzion Language Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
tools to verify correctness aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,
Rust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The
goal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in
these languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis
tools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical
applications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and
enable detailed control over run-time checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many current programming languages are getting more and more overloaded with new
concepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues.
Languages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous
inner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are
currently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types,
etc.  The possibility of nesting these different concepts results in
complexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and
execute the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure
of a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold
the contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over
the allocation decisions made by the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and
local variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision
where to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack
or in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if
dynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single
concept of a feature, the language implementation takes care of all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Side-effects and Security&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpected side-effects in library calls are the cause of a number of recent
security vulnerabilities such as log4shell.  The talk will give some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Algebraic Effects in Fuzion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fuzion, algebraic effects are features that inherit from a standard library
feature &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt;.  Algebraic effects are identified by their type, so different
heirs of &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; create different operations.  So the declaration of an effect
&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;effect&lt;em&gt; that provides an operation &lt;/em&gt;my&lt;em&gt;operation&lt;/em&gt; is a feature declaration
of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;effect&lt;em&gt; inheriting form &lt;/em&gt;effect&lt;em&gt; and declaring an inner feature
&lt;/em&gt;my&lt;em&gt;operation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the caller of a feature has to provide an implementation of an effect, it
is said that an effect has to be present in the environment of a given call. The
syntax to access an operation &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;operation&lt;em&gt; of an effect of type &lt;/em&gt;my&lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt;
uses the keyword &lt;em&gt;env&lt;/em&gt; as follows: &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;effect.env.&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;operation&lt;em&gt;, meaning that
we take the implementation of &lt;/em&gt;my&lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; from the current environment and then
perform &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;operation_ on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Algebraic Effect Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will interactively show how effects can be declared, used and
installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Type Parameters in Fuzion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will present the syntax of type parameters and the declaration of
operations associated with types.  This enables a functional counterpart static
methods in languages like Java without adding global state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be shown how this can be used to implement an abstract equality
operation that permits the definition of different implementations for different
types along an inheritance hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion and Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of effects and type parameters were important steps to make the
language more powerful while staying true to the spirit of Fuzion which is to
simplify and unify aspects as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small team of developers is now working on the Fuzion implementation with a
focus on the standard library, performance and interfaces with other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main points that are missing right now are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a powerful standard library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional library modules for all sorts of application needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-level foreign language interface for C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actual implementations of static analyzers and optimizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highly optimizing back-ends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;garbage collection for the C back-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;documentation, tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more enthusiastic contributors and users!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

making it a success!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>IDP-Z3, a reasoning engine for FO(.)</title>
        <subtitle>A truly declarative approach to programming.</subtitle>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An important sign of intelligence is the capacity to apply a body of declarative knowledge to a particular situation in order to, e.g., derive new knowledge, to determine relevant questions or to provide explanations.
IDP-Z3 is a reasoning engine that displays such intelligence: the knowledge is represented in the declarative language FO(.), aka FO-dot, and, based on that knowledge, IDP-Z3 can perform a variety of reasoning tasks under the control of a host language, Python.  This re-use of knowledge dramatically reduces software development time.
FO(.) is an expressive, yet very readable language that extends first order logic.
We present IDP-Z3, and how we used it to build a generic user interface, called the Interactive Consultant, that helps end-users make the right decision fast, within a particular problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FO(.) (aka FO-dot) is the Knowledge Representation language used by the IDP-Z3 reasoning engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FO(.) was introduced by Prof. Denecker (KU Leuven).
It is based on  first-order logic (FOL) for its constructs (i.e., logic connectives and quantification).
FO(.) extends FOL with a few language constructs to express complex information such as non-inductive, inductive and recursive definitions, and  aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An FO(.) Knowledge Base consists of a vocabulary and a "theory".
The vocabulary describes the domain-specific symbols that are used in the theory.
A theory is a collection of assertions about possible state of affairs.
There are three classes of assertions: constraints, definitions and enumerations.
States of affairs are represented by structures, that contains the values of the symbols of the vocabulary.
A structure that is possible according to the theory is called a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Knowledge Base (KB) written in FO(.) cannot be run: it is just a "bag of information" formally describing models in a problem domain.
This is a consequence of the FO(.) design goal to be task-agnostic.
A corollary is that such a KB does not distinguish inputs from outputs, and allows reasoning in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key advantage of the model-theoretic semantics is that it allows reasoning with incomplete knowledge of the state of affairs.
This knowledge is encoded in a partial structure.
When not much is known, many states of affairs are possible, and the theory has many models representing them.
As more information is obtained, the set of models is reduced.
This reduced set of models can be used to perform various forms of reasoning, e.g., to derive the consequences of what is known, or to find the model that maximizes a utility function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a very simple example, consider the voting law that states: "You have to vote in an election if you are at least 18 years old at election time (otherwise you can not)".
The formula in FO(.) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;vote() &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; 18 =&amp;lt; age().
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the age is known, the obligation to vote can be inferred;
if the obligation to vote is known to be true instead, the age is known to be 18 or more, in any model.
Furthermore, one can also find a lower bound of the age of a person, as soon as their obligation to vote is known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDP-Z3 is a reasoning engine that can perform a variety of reasoning tasks on knowledge bases in the FO(.) language.
The following generic computations are supported by IDP-Z3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model checking: Verifies that a theory is satisfiable given a structure, i.e., that it has at least one model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model expansion: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and computes a model of T that expands S, if one exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propagation: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and computes all their logical consequences, i.e., all the ground literals that are true in every model expansion of T and S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation: Takes a theory T, a partial structure S and a literal L obtained by propagation, and computes an explanation for L in the form of a minimal set of axioms in $T \cup S \cup {\lnot L}$ that is inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimisation: Takes a theory T, a partial structure S and a term, and computes the minimal value of the term in the set of all model expansions of T and S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevance: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and determines the atoms that are irrelevant (or ``do-not-care'') in the sense that, if one of their value were changed in any model M of T expanding S, the resulting M' structure would still be a model of T.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;IDP-Z3 can be run at the command line, or integrated in a Python application as a Python package downloadable from pypi (https://pypi.org/project/idp-engine/).
Computations can also be run online via a webIDE (https://interactive-consultant.idp-z3.be/IDE).
It is open source (https://gitlab.com/krr/IDP-Z3) under the LGPL 3 license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDP-Z3 comes with a demo web application, called the Interactive Consultant, that helps users make decision in accordance with an FO(.) knowledge base, using the reasoning abilities of IDP-Z3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generic in the sense that it can be reconfigured by simply changing the FO(.) knowledge base.
The user interface is automatically generated based on the vocabulary of the knowledge base: this helps reduce the cost of developing applications significantly.
It is available online (https://interactive-consultant.idp-z3.be/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interactive Consultant (IC) allows the user to enter data in any order.&lt;br/&gt;
The IC enables a safe exploration of the decision search space, without the possibility of making decisions leading to dead ends.
This is achieved by continuously computing the consequences of the data theory, using propagation.
If the user is unsure why the IC propagated a specific choice, they can ask for an explanation.
Additionally, while the user fills in what they know, the interface determines which parameters remain relevant, avoiding unnecessary work for the user.
After having input all values that they deem necessary, the user can ask the IC to show the optimal decision according to what is known, using optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing search for new programming metaphors I have devised a tiny language called Zarkov. Its proof-of-concept has been implemented in Javascript and allows for basic maths to be performed in either direction, i.e. forward and reverse. So, should you get a error, you can simply invoke the .back() method on the program object and the steps revert allowing you to see how/why it reached that state.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The PoC is essential a way of handling UNDO and REDO in terms that represent a programming language, rather than an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is it useful? Has it been done? How does LISP already do this? (Because LISP can do anything, right!? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a (mercifully!) short presentation, the floor is opened to see if the idea has merit or prior art, and whether it's worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>LuaRocks and the challenges of minimalism</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We love minimalistic systems, because their concise models fit our brains, and give us a sense of understanding of the whole in a way that is nearly impossible in other environments built around huge frameworks and the like. Lua is a minimalistic language — the source distribution of the language is about 360 kbytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in any minimalistic system or language, that nice base system itself is just the tip of the iceberg. Minimalistic environments are meant to be extended. How to avoid complexity from creeping in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the trials and tribulations of building LuaRocks, the package manager for a minimalistic language, aiming to nurture an ecosystem for the language while trying to keep its design true to the language's principles. We'll discuss lessons learned in the past 15 years of LuaRocks, and finally ask ourselves a question: is there such a thing as minimalistic software maintenance? What would that look like?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GStreamer is a popular multimedia framework making it possible to create a large variety of applications dealing with audio and video. Since the last FOSDEM, it has received a lot of new features: its RTP &amp;amp; WebRTC stack has greatly improved, Rust has become a first-class language, a high-level transcoding API was added, and much more. I will go over those major improvements and explain who they can be most useful for. Finally, I'll will look forward at the next releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework that caters to a whole range of multimedia needs, whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimedia middleware; embedded systems, desktops, or server farms. It is also cross-platform and works on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talks targets everyone who cares about Free and Open Source multimedia on embedded systems. GStreamer is the standard multimedia framework, not only on the Linux desktop, but most importantly, in embedded Linux systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will detail the current state of PipeWire and the plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PipeWire started out as a low-level multimedia transport layer. Services such as screen sharing and later audio routing were added on top of this infrastructure. Major distributions are now adopting PipeWire as a replacement for both JACK and PulseAudio. The next step for PipeWire will be to enhance the video sharing support.
This talk will briefly outline the architecture of PipeWire, the current status and the future plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Modern Camera Handling in Chromium</title>
        <subtitle>Implementing Camera Access with xdg-desktop-portal and PipeWire in Chromium</subtitle>
        <track>Open Media</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Chromium has used V4L2 for cameras for many years and it works reasonably 
well. Modern complex cameras are no longer a simple V4L2 device. libcamera 
must be used instead. For Chromium in a Flatpak or Snap container it would 
be nice to manage camera access at runtime. Or let's have some fun and use 
an arbitrary video stream as a camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the goal was to implement some kind of high-level camera interface. The 
choice of technology was easy: xdg-desktop-portal is already used for 
screen sharing and it has support for cameras as well. And PipeWire, the 
media daemon that handles the camera already supports libcamera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the implementation more than a year ago and it is still ongoing. 
This presentation gives an overview of the technologies involved, how it 
fits all together and the story of the long and winding road to implement 
this in Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the three years that have passed since the last Liquidsoap presentation, much change has happened! During this walk we will:
* Give an update on the community growth during the pandemic and recap what we learned during our two liquidshop events that mixed technical presentations with actual user projects presentations!
* Present some the recent advanced in the Liquidsoap language and how they can be be used to leverage awesome programming language ideas to create powerful, rich and safe media project scripts
* Showcase the new integration with FFmpeg and how Liquidsoap provides flexible and advanced usage of the excellent FFmpeg features and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk should be of interest for anyone with interest in community radio, media broadcasting and anything related to audio and video handling in general, including integration with online APIs and websites and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would also love to present and discuss our implementation of media APIs and the new abstractions that could be emerging in future implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is a double talk about "What's in the new release of FFmpeg 6.0", and a "demonstration of VLC running inside Webbrowsers using Wasm".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As FFmpeg 6.0 is approaching, what's new in it, what are the major and minor changes, and why you should care about the future work on FFmpeg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, a demonstration of VLC and its dependencies compiled to the web-browser using wasm, and using Webcodecs to decode the video.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>4K HDR video with AV1 : A Reality Check</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Open Media</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the adoption of VP9 by Netflix in 2016, royalty-free coding standards continued to gain prominence through the activities of the AOMedia consortium with AV1. In the early years after standardisation, High-dynamic-range (HDR) videos tends to be under served in open source encoders for a variety of reasons including the relatively small amount of true HDR content being broadcast and the challenges in optimisation with that material. Fast-forward to 2022, there has been a rise of HDR content which is publicly available.
In this presentation, we review the AV1 Playback, present challenges and various strategies to adopt for a scientific testing environment for HDR signal conformance and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FFV1 is a lossless, royalty free and open source video coding format. We'll present the work made around it, especially the IETF standardization work (RFC 9043), the reference encoder/decoder (FFmpeg), a FFV1 conformance checker (MediaConch), and a practical usage of it through the RAWcooked project, as well as its planned usage in MXF.
We'll also talk about the standardization of its audio counterpart, FLAC, and the accompanying container, Matroska.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AVX512 assembly instructions are now available on many CPUs and can offer substantial improvements for some workloads. Whilst the dav1d AV1 decoder project has had AVX512 assembly for some time, it is only recently that FFmpeg has some. This presentation will explain current and future AVX512 assembly optimisations in FFmpeg.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Quick overview of variable-length vector processing instruction set extensions (ARM SVE2 and RISC-V Vectors).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;4 decades later, vector processing is making a coming in 2 instructions sets.
We will (very quickly) review how this differs from traditional SIMD and how to take those new vector extensions into use in open-source multimedia inner loops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using the FIM (Fbi IMproved) Universal Image Viewer</title>
        <subtitle>A scriptable and highly configurable, yet minimalistic image viewer for X, the Linux framebuffer, and Ascii Art, for command line users</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FIM (Fbi IMproved) is a `swiss army-knife' image viewer. You can use it under the Linux Framebuffer, under X, or in text terminals (ASCII Art), with a consistent interface and with many powerful features. Whether for occasional image viewing, creation of tagged pictures collections, tailoring short and specialized scripts or custom actions, or viewing graphics on a Raspberry Pi, there are many situations where the unique features of FIM make the difference. FIM grew out a fork of the FBI image viewer, and its name is inspired by the VIM text editor. This talk will tour peculiar use cases where FIM shines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The broadcast industry are getting more and more interested in sub second media ingestion and media delivery but already have particular standards integrated into their workflows such as SRT or NDI - bridging the gap between WebRTC and these protocols and technologies is ever more important to increase the continued adoption of WebRTC - both WHIP and WHEP play a vital part in this increased adoption. In this session we'll take a look at what the broadcast industry have available to them today and the challenges involved in merging these worlds with Open Source technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The open source stack for animation movie pipelines</title>
        <subtitle>The tools needed to cover every  step of the animation movie creation process</subtitle>
        <track>Open Media</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Animation creation pipelines have been largely dominated by proprietary software for ages. Fortunately, for a few years, we assist a shift largely led by Blender on both 2D and 3D animation productions.
We'll see in this presentation the main steps needed to build an animation movie (in 2D and 3D), and what it requires in terms of asset and project management.
Parallelly, we will see for each aspect what tools can be used and when open-source solutions can be used fully.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We'll first see how Blender covers all the main aspects of a 3D animation movie and how it can be used to achieve 2D animation with Grease Pencil.
We'll include Krita in the talk to show that it can be used too to make backgrounds or textures.
Then, we'll discuss how OpenPype and Kitsu can be used to cover the asset management aspect (files) and the project management aspect (tasks and deliveries).
Finally, we'll talk about the compositing step with Natron.
To finish, we'll mention some studios and productions that use Blender on a daily basis to make their movies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Melrōse, a music programming environment</title>
        <subtitle>new language to program MIDI sequences</subtitle>
        <track>Open Media</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Melrōse is both a language and a tool to create and listen to music interactively, The language uses musical primitives (note, sequence, chord) and many functions (map, group, transpose) that can be used to create more complex patterns, loops and tracks. Melrōse uses MIDI output to produce sound by any (hard or software) device attached. Melrōse can also react on MIDI inputs to start, record and stop playing musical objects. A plugin is available for Microsoft Visual Studio for the best usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Music is like a structured language so why not try to program parts of it.
With Melrōse I found a good mix between writing music and interacting using audio feedback.
The presentation will be come with lot of tunes, sounds and demos.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Become a rockstar using FOSS!</title>
        <subtitle>Or at least use FOSS to write and share music for fun!</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: it's a clickbait title, I'm not really a rockstar! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it's usually not that well known, but Linux has an amazing ecosystem for creating music, whatever genre you like, with a ton of fantastic applications to tackle different stages of the music production. In this presentation, I'll share what my experience has been in this past couple of years, talking about the different applications I've used to compose, orchestrate, process, mix, master and so on, with real or virtual instruments, and how that allowed me to publish a few albums just for the fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The music production ecosystem on Linux is huge, and yet it's unortunately not that well known, possibly because it's seen more as "just" software for entertainment purposes rather than something much more serious and valuable than that. JACK and, more recently, Pipewire provide an excellent environment for working with low latency music, and there's a ton of applications that can help at different stages of music production. There's software for composing and/or orchestrating your music, using music sheets, piano rolls or patterns; software for processing your real instruments and software for simulating virtual instruments, including complex syntethizers; DAWs to work on music projects in a more organized way; a plethora of plugins that can be used in different applications to customize the way each track needs to be processed, and mix/master your work; and so on and so forth. And while I mostly like working on "rock" and orchestral music (and so the talk will focus a bit more on software that helped me do that), there's so much software out there to help with basically any genre that you may be interested in, from classical music to dub and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also talk a bit of the community aspects of it (for instance introducing the LinuxMusicians forum or the "Made with Ardour" topic that allowed me to meet so many other people using FOSS to create and share their music), and share a few notes about how you can indeed share your music with the world (or at least how I did it!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Distributing multicast channels to 3rd parties: a case study with OSS and virtualization/SR-IOV</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Open Media</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Live channels are often carried as transport stream over UDP or RTP multicast. Often such a stream must be handed over to a 3rd party for further processing or distribution, via a dedicated L2 Ethernet link. In practice, to ensure network isolation, this requires copying the multicast stream between two VLANs (with optional processing), an operation performed by expensive and proprietary hardware equipments such as DCMs. This presentation will explore the options using standard PCs and OSS such as DVBlast. For even better isolation, the speaker will also explore software virtualization using Linux/KVM and the SR-IOV feature of some network cards. The use of these technologies with multicast has proven difficult, as this case study will show.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let’s do things differently. To start with, let us view logs and traces as no different from any other data. The data an application indirectly generates when in use (the logs and traces) is no different from the data an application directly works with (input and output). So let’s keep them all together in a scalable cloud storage repository. Once it is there, it is just like any other big data. We need to analyze and apply intelligent monitoring to detect situations of interest. So we need to apply trained ML models to a stream of such data for immediate alerting when the traces indicate an unwanted behavior occurring or brewing. This talk will show how to harness existing technologies to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An instant world requires instant decisions at scale. This includes the ability to digest and react to changes in real-time. Thus, event logs such as Apache Kafka can be found in almost every architecture, while databases and similar systems still provide the foundation. Change Data Capture (CDC) has become popular for propagating changes. Nevertheless, integrating all these systems, which often have slightly different semantics, can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we highlight what it means for Apache Flink to be a general data processor that acts as a data integration hub. Looking under the hood, we demonstrate Flink's SQL engine as a changelog processor that ships with an ecosystem tailored to processing CDC data and maintaining materialized views. We will discuss the semantics of different data sources and how to perform joins or stream enrichment between them. This talk illustrates how Flink can be used with systems such as Kafka (for upsert logging), Debezium, JDBC, and others.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache Beam is an open source SDK for data pipelines, with an unified model for batch and streaming pipelines. The SDK is multi-runner and portable: you may run your pipeline on Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Cloud Dataflow and other runners. In this talk, we will cover the main features of Beam for streaming analytics pipelines, with some examples of the capabilities to apply complex time-based logics to streams of data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title> Building A Real-Time Analytics Dashboard with Streamlit, Apache Pinot, and Apache Pulsar</title>
        <subtitle>Best of Both Worlds with Event Streaming and Real-Time Analytics</subtitle>
        <track>Fast and Streaming Data</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Data Analytics is becoming very popular these days because of the important values and insights that it is bringing to the business.  It also relies on super-fast data ingestion and that is all possible by leveraging on a powerful event-driven streaming platform.  Two very important Open Source Apache projects have risen to serve such a grand purpose: Apache Pulsar for event streaming and Apache Pinot for real-time analytics.  We take a look at how both of these projects can integrate very well together and achieve the blazingly fast results that we desire and show you a use case that we've built.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When you hear "decision maker", it's natural to think, "C-suite", or "executive". But these days, we're all decision-makers. Restaurant owners, bloggers, big box shoppers, diners - we all have important decisions to make and need instant actionable insights. In order to provide these insights to end-users like us, businesses need access to fast, fresh analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we will learn how to build our own real-time analytics application on top of a streaming data source using Apache Pulsar, Apache Pinot, and Streamlit. Pulsar is a distributed, open source pub-sub messaging and streaming platform for real-time workloads, Pinot is an OLAP database designed for ultra low latency analytics, and Streamlit is a Python based tool that makes it super easy to build data based apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing each of these tools, we’ll stream data into Pulsar using its Python client, ingest that data into a Pinot real-time table, and write some basic queries using Pinot’s Python SDK. Once we've done that, we’ll bring everything together with an auto refreshing Streamlit dashboard so that we can see changes to the data as they happen. There will be lots of graphs and other visualisations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session is aimed at application developers and data engineers who want to quickly make sense of streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will build a few analytical apps from scratch. This includes the full circle: data collection, processing, and visualization, and most of this is done by ClickHouse and a bunch of one-line shell scripts. The emphasis of this talk is to show how approachable and powerful are modern data processing tools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Opening up European Public Procurement Data</subtitle>
        <track>Graph Systems and Algorithms</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;TEDective is a free software (open-source) solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts. Let’s say you are a curious citizen who wants to find out how much taxpayer money your municipality spends each year on unfree software. To date, there is no free software-backed, community-developed application out there that helps you answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEDective changes that by bringing light into the public procurement data published by the EU’s Tenders European Daily (TED) project. It transforms the XML files provided by TED into the interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) and then visualizes the data as a graph of relationships between companies and the public bodies they supply. Currently, neo4j is used to store the TEDective graph. Finally, the data will be enriched by other complementary data sources such as OpenCorporates and OpenSanctions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, public institutions in the EU spend more than €2 trillion on various goods and services. While the EU publishes a lot of data about public procurement in the form of TED (https://ted.europa.eu), somebody interested in European public procurement still faces a lot of difficulties: TED data is overly complex, doesn’t follow the international and interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard and is hard to explore as the UI provided by TED is limited to basic filtering and search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation was the starting point for TEDective – an initiative by the Free Software Foundation Europe to make European public procurement data both accessible and explorable - for everybody. We believe that the transparency needed by such a solution to function in the interest of its users can only be provided by a community-led free software project. TEDective is such a project. The project already won the first prize at this year’s EU Datathon. With this initial funding, we are now keen to spread the word and build a community of data science, procurement and usability experts who can help us in our quest to open up and democratise European public procurement data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the talk, we will show you what we have done so far and how you can help us make TEDective more useful every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>On the HashGNN node embedding algorithm</title>
        <subtitle>A new algorithm in GDS 2.3</subtitle>
        <track>Graph Systems and Algorithms</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will walk through a node embedding algorithm called HashGNN.
Node embedding algorithms provide an important bridge between graphs and traditional machine learning.
Such algorithms construct for each node in a graph an associated vector which can capture local graph structure and properties.
We will discuss why HashGNN is a useful embedding algorithm, its implementation in GDS which is an extension to heterogenous graphs, some intuition behind it, how it compares to Graph Neural Networks which inspired HashGNN, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>ipysigma: a Jupyter widget for interactive visual network analysis</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for exploratory data analysis as it is very easy to process and visualize data using traditional charts. However, they lack utilities to properly explore networks interactively. The ipysigma library therefore proposes a Jupyter widget enabling its users to perform visual network analysis from the comfort of a notebook. ipysigma makes it simple to tweak a network's visual variables to display it exactly as you intend. This way, you can perform a work at the crossroad between Python processing of graph data and visual exploration like you would do for example with Gephi. It supports networkx and igraph seamlessly and can be easily used by numpy and pandas users all the same. Different usecases of ipysigma will be showcased during the talk through a dataset about FOSDEM history. We will also demonstrate how ipysigma is able to render synchronized &amp;amp; interactive "small multiples" of a same network so that one can easily compare different features. ipysigma is developed at the médialab of SciencesPo and uses graphology and sigma.js (JavaScript libraries able to render interactive graphs in web browsers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N.B.: Talk was actually given by Benjamin Ooghe-Tabanou, replacing a very ill Guillaume Plique.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>A case for DAG databases</title>
        <subtitle>Correlating revision history with CI results</subtitle>
        <track>Graph Systems and Algorithms</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Graph database servers have grown immensely powerful, but they still can't query DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) better than a command-line tool can: git. One CI system needs just that to correlate results and bugs with the revision history of the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The KCIDB system at Linux Foundation's KernelCI project has been collecting build and test results for the Linux kernel for a while. We receive about 10K build and 200K test results per day from seven CI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, due to the specifics of the Linux development process, and the nature of testing an OS kernel, this raw data alone is not very useful to developers. In order to filter out already-known issues, spot new ones, and track performance trends, we need to correlate our results to the Linux revision history, which forms a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our attempts to find a solution were unsuccessful: Neo4j couldn't do it, and we couldn't find another system which would be sufficiently different to offer hope. So, we're here to either find one, or inspire you to create one, specifically targeting large DAGs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since 1950, force layouts have dominated the graph visualization scenario, as of easy implementation. However, placing aesthetic constraints may not be obvious to obtain an effective visualization.
In this talk the goal is discussing an AI-based methodology alternative to Force Layouts, allowing the flexible application of various aesthetic constraints for an effective visualization for the end user.
Furthermore, a parallel version on CPU will be proposed to allow visualization in large contexts&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Graph Stream Zoomer</title>
        <subtitle>A window-based graph stream grouping system based on Apache Flink</subtitle>
        <track>Graph Systems and Algorithms</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Christopher Rost will present "graph stream zoomed", a graph stream grouping algorithm resulting from two master thesis. It enables real-time zooming of a property graph stream, from a schema graph stream to more fine-grained summarizations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Graphs today are not only very large and heterogeneous, but also change over time. In addition to the typical storage of a graph in a database and subsequent analysis, some use cases require reactivity, and thus recent work has focused on processing the graph in a stream model. Real-time query and analysis of high-frequency incoming graph data, such as social network interactions, click streams, bike rentals, or supply chain product updates, provides continuous insights into to the most recent portion of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph summarization (or grouping) as a typical analysis has been well explored for static graphs, but there are just a few new approaches using of a graph stream, especially when the stream is modelled after the property graph model and thus has labels and properties on the streamed vertices and edges. In this talk, we present a graph stream grouping algorithm and a distributed reference implementation based on Apache Flink. It enables window-based summarization of the property graph stream by grouping vertices and edges on equal characteristics using so-called key functions. This enables various zoom granularities, from a schema graph stream to more fine-grained summarizations. In addition, elements leading to a group can be aggregated in flexible ways to provide deeper insights in the respective summarized vertices and edges. A bicycle rental graph stream is used to demonstrate the power of the algorithm and the multitude of analytical questions that can be answered with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The LDBC Social Network Benchmark</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Graph Systems and Algorithms</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we describe the LDBC Social Network Benchmark's two workloads: the Interactive workload for transactional graph database systems and the Business Intelligence workload for analytical graph data systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) was founded in 2012 by vendors and academic researchers with the aim of making graph processing performance measurable and comparable. To this end, LDBC provides open-source benchmark suites with openly available data sets starting at 1 GB and scaling up to 30 TB. Additionally, it allows vendors to submit their benchmark implementations to LDBC-certified auditors who ensure that the benchmark executions are reproducible and comply with the specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We describe the key features of both workloads, including their data sets, queries, and update operations. We explain how they ensure meaningful and interpretable results via careful parameter tuning. Finally, we showcase the workloads' reference implementations (maintained by vendors and community members).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected prior knowledge: specialized prior knowledge is not needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intended audience: developers and users of graph database management systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Speakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gábor Szárnyas is a post-doctoral researcher at CWI Amsterdam. He is the lead developer of the LDBC Social Network Benchmark's BI workload and the maintainer of the Graphalytics benchmark. He is a member of the LDBC steering committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Püroja is a research software engineer at CWI Amsterdam and the maintainer of the LDBC Social Network Benchmark's Interactive workload. He is a certified LDBC auditor.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Gephi towards v1.0: the codebase, and the rest</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Graph Systems and Algorithms</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gephi is a popular open source network visualization software. In this talk we propose to share how we build the future of Gephi on two levels: the code, and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two years, we have been making efforts to sustain Gephi over the long term. The threats to the project are sometimes about the code, sometimes not: what if a library we use, and is no longer maintained, becomes incompatible with the latest MacOS? What if the few people who know the codebase get out of the project, and we cannot transfer that knowledge to new devs? What if we fail to recruit new developers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of good will around Gephi, and yet making the project healthy is not easy because the path to sustainability is not obvious. This is the discussion we want to have with developers, both to share what works, and to get some feedback to improve. We are not there yet, and we struggle to recruit Java developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will be given by two co-founders of the project, Mathieu Bastian, the historic architect of the Gephi codebase, and Mathieu Jacomy, the designer of Gephi and a researcher in network visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the topics we want to touch upon are:
* What is the Gephi road map and why is it how it is
* The path to funding the project
* Our "Gephi code sustainability retreats", where they shined, where they failed
* The relation we build two communities: the users, and the devs.
* Documenting the codebase and engaging developers
* How the Gephi project acknowledges the web as a platform (Gephi Lite)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Migrating from proprietary to Open-Source knowledge management tools</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We can observe in the latest years that individuals, companies and institutions are more driven towards Open Source Software due to privacy concerns, vendor lock in, data lock in and ethical reasons. When choosing a tool for Knowledge Management, many great Open Source tools are available and can meet any needs from documentation networks to digital intranets and even public websites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, migrating from a tool to another can be difficult and discouraging due to missing modules, incompatibility, unclear documentation or a steep learning curve. At XWiki we understood these concerns and made efforts to continuously improve our migration tools and welcome any user wishing to migrate from other software to XWiki. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this presentation we will demonstrate how to seamlessly migrate from Confluence and Sharepoint to XWiki while maintaining the content structure, history, and metadata. &lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Deploy an enterprise search server with Fess</title>
        <subtitle>Search GitLab, Redmine, and repositories with a single query</subtitle>
        <track>Collaboration and Content Management</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will illustrate how organizations can configure and deploy OSS enterprise search server Fess, based on our own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fess is, by and large, a well-documented, user-friendly tool. Yet, no matter how good the tool is, deploying a search server on your own brings a number of challenges. I will talk about the challenges we had and how we overcame them. Our hope is that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will have a good grasp of what it is like to configure and deploy an enterprise search server, whether or not you are considering deploying one at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should you decide to deploy one, you can (hopefully) do so with a significantly lower cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today's technology companies often use multiple content management systems, resulting in information (e.g. source code, document files, and wiki pages) fragmented and stored in many places. Consequently, engineers sometimes end up searching multiple locations one by one, repeating the same query at each place, to look for the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution would be to build and deploy a search server which, given a query, fetches the relevant code and documents from all the content management systems, much like a web search, such as Google, does on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a daunting task, as it would essentially mean setting up and maintaining the whole end-to-end system of search as a service, from web crawlers to search box UI. Fortunately, there is an OSS search server built for this exact purpose. We are here to share the knowledge, experiences, and insights we have gained so far, so that you can build your own enterprise search server, using OSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will first explain what search-related problems we had to solve, as well as briefly touching on what enterprise search is in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I'll go over what Fess is and explain its core features, which will serve as an introductory, informational session for this lesser-known OSS enterprise search server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the core part of the talk, I will dive deep into how we configured, customized, and deployed Fess for our specific purpose. Our objectives were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to index contents on issue tracking/project management tools we use (GitLab &amp;amp; Redmine) and in repositories (Git &amp;amp; Subversion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to enable users to search the indexed contents from a single search box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We achieved both of these objectives but we had to overcome several hurdles. I will share things such as what pitfalls/shortcomings Fess has and how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also talk about what we have made and contributed; our dev team wrote several patches for fixing and customizing Fess. 3 of the patches are bug fixes and 2 of them have been merged into the mainline. 2 other patches are customizations designed to meet our specific requirements. One of them allows the crawler to pass the custom authentication page of our GitLab implemented with SAML and Keycloak. The other patch re-maps the crawled filesystem paths to the webpage URLs; this was crucial to cut the time to index contents in repositories by reading files on the local filesystem instead of following links on the webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this segment is to provide the information which will allow future Fess users to deploy it with a dramatically smaller time and effort investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I will share our experiences with our preliminary deployments inside TOSHIBA. We will explain resource requirements and performance, such as how long it takes to crawl and index a given size of resources (basically web pages and files) using how much computing resource. This will help future Fess users make estimates on how much computing resource they need to secure in order to deploy it. Along with that, we will reveal details such as how Fess's ability to index contents inside Microsoft Office documents and PDF files helped engineers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Enabling third parties to integrate with your core application requires far more than allowing the use of the same API that your front-end already consumes. Access control and cross-domain requests are usually the first spots where problems appear. Based on the experience of integrating OpenProject with Nextcloud we cover the most typical road blocks that product developers should remove.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;2023 is different: Like never before publicly funded initiatives strive for replacing big tech’s data hungry cloud services with open-source products. Development teams are busy improving the cross product user experience by developing integrations and hit the same obstacles again and again. This talk tries to create awareness for typical integration developer needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As has become a bit of a tradition, let's look at what's new in Nextcloud in 2023! 3 releases again, with tons of improvements all over.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick overview: bulk upload, profile page, appointment booking, Nextcloud Office and Nextcloud Backup in Nextcloud 24, which we named Hub II. 3 months later, Hub II/25 introduced User migration, smart file locking, 4x lower db load, Reactions &amp;amp; media tab in Talk, Reply to calls &amp;amp; messages in Desktop client, Undo send &amp;amp; schedule emails. Then, Hub 3 brought a complete design overhaul with much accessibility work, Photos 2.0 with image editor &amp;amp; face recognition, message expiration, polls and direct document creation in Talk, an org chart in Contacts, a lot of performance work and more. Don't think you can now skip the talk - there's a ton more!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Following GitHub’s adoption and ”flavouring” of Markdown in 2009, many other major projects such as Reddit, Stack Exchange have followed suit, even WhatsApp now uses it to add formatting to your instant messages. That’s mainstream!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiki has long wished for a common wiki markup language, starting with involvement in Wiki Creole and inclusion of PEAR Text_Wiki adaptors since 2010? we started integrating markdown and now, in Tiki 25, offer it as an alternative syntax in all text areas, such as wiki pages, blog posts, comments and so on. In future versions Markdown will become the only active syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How CryptPad lets you have both</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Centralized proprietary collaboration software has recently faced a grown scepticism. In November 2022, the French Government officially asked schools to not use Google's and Microsoft's collaboration services. Luckily there are open source alternatives that can be self-hosted to give individuals and institutions more contol over their data. While users thus do no more need to rely on big companies, they still need to trust the system administrators hosting the software to respect the user's privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted open source collaboration suite. It seeks to reconcile collaboration and privacy. Users make changes to documents and these are encrypted by their client (web browser) before being sent to the server for real-time synchronization. CryptPad hides the technicalities of encryption from its users and provides a clean and intuitive interface to ease fast adaption.
In this talk I will present how CryptPad keeps the user's data private and protects them against a passively sniffing server. I will show why we combine end-to-end encryption with open source and will talk about the ecosystem around CryptPad.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building an open-source community with hundreds of people from all over the world who come together to develop highly complex software systems or collaborate on cutting-edge research is no easy task. It requires communication tools that support transparency in decision making, asynchronous collaboration, and efficient use of community members’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know there are key (and overlapping) groups of people who make up a vibrant community: project leaders, core and casual contributors, new and experienced folks, and end users. Looking at these categories, we can define shared and specific communication needs for working and collaborating together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zulip has made key design choices and invested in developing many features to address these particular needs. Let's dive in and explore together the unique characteristics of Zulip and how they can (and have) impacted collaboration and communication in FOSS and research communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Passwordless and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are becoming a trend and their usage will increase in the near future. However, most of the solutions target the web/online pattern, or the local users, thus leaving centralized identity management for console and POSIX system applications lacking those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last year FreeIPA and SSSD have been working on enabling FIDO2/WebAuthn support for remotely managed users. One part of it is enabling a user stored in a LDAP server to locally authenticate in a system using a FIDO2 key. Another part is to use FIDO2 authentication to obtain a Kerberos ticket. This opens a new world to organizations to tighten their security, while maintaining strict control as to who access their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the progress in FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication in SSSD by providing the implementation state, the solution details and a demo. Additional information on the possible expansion of the solution will also be provided.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FIDO security keys can be used effectively to secure access to websites and applications, rendering phishing attacks harmless with hardware-protected cryptographic keys while keeping a low-friction user experience.
Security keys can however also be used for different use cases, that don't necessarily involve a browser.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will briefly explain what FIDO Security Keys are and how they work.
We will then show how security keys can be used as an alternative to more traditional hardware security solutions like smartcards.
In particular we will explain how tools like OpenSSH can be used to not only authenticate users when accessing servers, but also to sign files or other data, such as git commits.
We will explain how attestation works and how you can prove that a signature was made using a security key, and how to reliably determine the type of security key used.
We will show what FIDO extensions can be used, for instance to store small data files such as certificates on a security key, or to derive symmetric keys that can be used to encrypt data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'd like to collect feedback from participants in identifying other use cases that could benefit from security keys as a low cost and versatile way to secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Are you a sysadmin and feeling paranoid? Let's promote security hardening to another level. Perhaps, with the concept of Application Whitelisting you will be able to sleep again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we are going to harden a Linux system with a file access policy daemon - fapolicyd. This daemon enables administrators to block or allow specific applications and executables using a fine-grained policy. We plan to explore the daemon’s possibilities and we want to get through its configuration. We will analyze multiple variations of set ups and evaluate their security aspects. We are going to demonstrate with an altered binary how integrity checking enablement prevents malicious attack. After the session, attendees will understand how to follow a problem and design their own policy with security in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation is based on Red Hat/Fedora Linux environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "Sudo logs for Blue Teamers" that was due to have been given by Peter Czanik, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend as he has fallen ill.  We wish him a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the first implementation of elliptic curves over finite fields for the GnuPG and the implementation on OpenSSL of the curves over finite and binary fields, back in the 2000s, many things have happened over this mathematical construction. We've witnessed instances like the birth and death of certain isogenies or searching for algorithms that resist quantum computing, which are only a few to mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved from the NIST curves on the P1363 to use Edwards variety, and there is a recent proposal with Double-odd curves. So the assortment is increasing, but we need to squeeze them more. For each new curve, all users always share the same group. This talk will review the path walked and evaluate the progress in implementing the Double-odd Jacobi Quartic in Libgcrypt and GnuPG.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 3.0 key feature was FIPS-140-2 certification. As FIPS-140-2 is sunseting, we had to significantly patch OpenSSL to make it FIPS-140-3 capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation briefly describes major changes in OpenSSL 3.0 architecture, what happened to Old Good API and why deal with new, the provider concepts, and changes necessary to match the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 3.0 key feature was FIPS-140-2 certification. To deal with it properly, the architecture was significantly changed, and applications have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of API calls were deprecated, the engines shouldn't be used now, and applications can't rely on all the algorithms are still with us. The brand new provider concept opens new way to extend OpenSSL functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As FIPS-140-2 is sunseting, the upstream version can't be taken as is for the future version of the standard. We had to significantly patch OpenSSL to make it FIPS-140-3 capable. We also provided some extra hardening to be sure that only up-to-date algorithms are in use, limited SHA-1 usage, and introduced many other changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Kerberos PKINIT extension replaces password authentication with
X.509 PKI.  This bring some advantages but also new risks.  This
presentation explains and demonstrates how PKINIT works, and
presents a novel attack against FreeIPA's PKINIT implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kerberos is an authentication and single sign-on protocol based on
symmetric cryptography.  To avoid the drawbacks and risks of
passwords, the &lt;strong&gt;PKINIT&lt;/strong&gt; protocol extension enables clients to
authenticate using public key cryptography and X.509 certificates.
To further improve security, private keys can reside and
signing/decrytion operations can be performed on hardware
cryptographic tokens (smart card, PIV, TPM, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start the talk with a brief overview of the core Kerberos
protocol.  Next I will explain how the PKINIT extension works, and
demonstrate how to set up and use PKINIT in a FreeIPA environment.
(FreeIPA is a free software identity management system that includes
MIT Kerberos and Dogtag PKI.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I will discuss some of the risks that arise when using
PKINIT, and security considerations for implementers and deployers.
I will present and demonstrate a recently discovered PKINIT security
flaw in some older (but still supported) versions of FreeIPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In various scenarios, it is necessary to attest the integrity of a remote machine, making sure that the system was booted securely, essential files were not modified and that only allowed software is executed.  For this purpose, we present Keylime as a remote attestation solution. It leverages the trust from the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in combination with UEFI Measured Boot and the Linux Kernel Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) which are probably available on your system today. We will present how Keylime works and real world applications for remote attestation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Public Key Encryption is a new standard which got finalized in February 2022. It uses asymmetric encryption to transfer a symmetric key between two participants which is then used to encrypt the communication. The standard itself is not post-quantum resistant. The presentation explains how to make it post-quantum resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <subtitle>Git Checkout Authentication to the Rescue of Supply Chain Security</subtitle>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You clone a Git repository, then pull from it.  How can you tell its contents are “authentic”—i.e., coming from the “genuine” project you think you’re pulling from?  With commit signatures and “verified” badges ✅ flourishing, you’d think this has long been solved—but nope!  This is in essence the problem GNU Guix, as a software deployment tool and GNU/Linux distribution, had to solve as we will see in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A key element of supply chain security is updates: how can we make sure software updates are secure?  That one doesn’t risk running malicious software when updating software their system?  For free system distributions, The Update Framework (TUF) has become a reference on these matters.  However, TUF is designed with binary distributions in mind—think Debian or even PyPI—and is not suite for “source distributions” like GNU Guix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present how Guix distributes software packages and the mechanisms central to supply chain security in Guix: reproducible builds, builds from source (the “full-source bootstrap”), and provenance tracking.  Software updates in Guix amount to ‘git pull’ so the security of updates translates to the ability to authenticate Git checkouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this pretty fundamental problem was still in search of a solution.  Guix developed a simple mechanism for Git authentication, which has been used in production for a couple of years. I will present it and, given that the solution is generic, show how it could benefit Git users alike.  We’ll also reflect on how Guix’s approach compares to those developed by tools like slsa or in-toto.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Privacy and Collaboration in CryptPad</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The level of privacy awareness once reserved for messaging applications is reaching other forms of online collaboration such as office suites. Many companies, including "big tech", claim that their platforms enable users to privately collaborate. However, the definition of what privacy actually means varies widely. While there are no ways to verify claims made about proprietary software, the impact on users is very tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted open source collaboration suite. It seeks to reconcile collaboration and privacy. Users make changes to documents and these are encrypted by their client (web browser) before being sent to the server for real-time synchronization. In this talk I will detail CryptPad's privacy definition and introduce the assumed threat model of an honest-but-curious server. While users have to trust the server to not actively attack their privacy, they can nevertheless protect themselves against a passively sniffing server. I will show why end-to-end encryption is not enough, but must be combined with open source to achieve reasonable privacy in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an R&amp;amp;D engineer who joined the team a few months ago with a focus on cryptography. I quickly realized that security and privacy in CryptPad rely on much more than just algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How to protect your Kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/"&gt;CrowdSec&lt;/a&gt; project aims at providing a crowdsourced approach to common infrastructure defense problems by distributing free &amp;amp; open-source software allowing you to protect yourself and share information about malevolent actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Presentation, we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about CrowdSec project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to install CrowdSec in Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how you can detect and block attacks in your applications deployed in k8s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;CrowdSec could be perceived as a modern form of Fail2ban, though for Cloud and container-based infrastructure as well, and capable of taking way more advanced decisions a lot faster. Mainly, it’s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML &amp;amp; Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs, and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat if need be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution, and resource-conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endgame is the Reputation engine, though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by "bouncers" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;via Nginx lua plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;via Traefik middleware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, Kubernetes, serverless, and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors possible in the form of a real-time IP reputation system accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the "meta" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source IP, date, and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to building a strong community with all that it implies :
* &lt;a href="https://hub.crowdsec.net"&gt;a public hub&lt;/a&gt; to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and blockers
* permissive open-source license to stay business-friendly
* and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality by tooling and behavior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.
In this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a Kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Secure voice/video over IP communications today and tomorrow thanks to post-quantum encryption !</title>
        <subtitle>The Linphone softphone has integrated CRYSTALS-Kyber, the NIST finalist algorithm in the encryption key category</subtitle>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Current developments in the field of quantum computer science bring a growing threat against the existing cryptographic algorithms used today, for example in secure Voice over IP and instant messaging applications. Although such a quantum computer has not yet been officially announced, some governments recommends protecting data against this type of attack by 2030. The encrypted data shared today could be stored and decrypted soon thanks to this breakthrough innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched in 2017 an international competition to standardise "post quantum algorithms". Such algorithms are expected to be resilient to an attack made by a generalist post quantum computer. They are meant to replace in the long term the algorithms that are used today in many secure protocols relying on cryptographic key exchange mechanisms.  The Linphone application is most likely the first open source communication software in the world to have implemented the NIST finalist algorithm in the encryption key category, CRYSTALS-Kyber, as of today. One of the key steps: the development of a modified version of the standardized ZRTP encryption protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few challenges we have taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach the same level of effectiveness even if cryptographic keys are much larger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remain resilient to classic attacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be interoperable with encryption features offered by previous versions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The different steps that have been carried out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration of KEM in ZRTP protocol: creation of a modified version of ZRTP that accepts a key exchange algorithm of the type of Key Encapsulation Mechanism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybridation : conception of an encryption engine combining a classic (EC)DH and a post quantum encryption. Modification of the ZRTP protocol so that it can negotiate two different key exchange algorithms at the same time and securely combine results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation: addition of a mechanism to fragment ZRTP packets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration in Linphone of this new ZRTP library with post quantum capacities and of configuration settings to activate/deactivate the post quantum mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building of performance tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Computer attacks occur in a constantly changing environment. To meet these challenges, it is necessary to implement a global approach to risk management within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mapping of the Information System allows to have a global view of all the elements which compose the information system to obtain a better readability, and thus a better control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elaboration of a cartography participates in the protection, the defense and the resilience of the information system. It is an essential tool for the control of its Information System and is an obligation for Operators of Vital Importance (OVI) and is part of a global risk management and a global risk management approach.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At a time when cyberattacks are growing in number and complexity, it is necessary for organizations to develop a general risk management strategy. As part of an overall approach, Mercator is a key tool in keeping control over the information system. It provides insight into all of the information system’s components and a clearer picture of the information system by presenting it from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercator helps organisations mapping their information systems in order for them to meet the operational requirements of cybersecurity. It helps to build a map in five simple, practical steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be used by any organisation, irrespective of their type, size, maturity in terms of cybersecurity or the complexity of their information system. It is Open Source and can be used by organisations in the public and private sectors alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hardware-backed attestation in TLS</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Authentication among distributed workloads is a critical yet complex task. PKI-based authentication relies heavily on software to anchor the trustworthiness of workloads, therefore failing to reliably convey the security state of the workload in the face of impersonation and persistent attackers. This is most apparent in cases where the underlying platform is particularly exposed and out of the control of the owner, such as in cloud computing and IoT. Hardware features have thus been introduced to enable remotely verifiable “trust metrics” using attestation. Such hardware-backed features provide a cryptographic proof of the software stack, and strong guarantees that the cryptographic keys used by the workload are properly protected from exfiltration. However, remote attestation comes with its own need to share and verify metadata, which must be engineered into existing software. While the protocol used to exchange this metadata is largely irrelevant to the actual attestation procedure, its positioning in the networking stack can enable specific use-cases and enhance the performance of the entire system. An appealing approach is to allow the creation of secure channels (such as TLS connections) using attestation metadata as the authentication mechanism. Current designs either rely on running an attestation protocol on top of an existing secure channel, or modify the semantics of certificates to convey attestation information when establishing the secure channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work focuses on standardising attestation metadata as first-class credentials in TLS. This new approach allows native, opaque metadata to be conveyed for authentication during the TLS handshake instead of (or together with) x509 certificates. Supporting flexibility in deployments without compromising on security has been a prime goal. Thus, we aim to cater to interaction models in which either the client, the server, or both can attest themselves, leveraging any hardware backend, and using different verification topologies. To showcase the standardisation effort, we are also developing an open-source, end-to-end proof-of-concept implementation of one of the interaction models supported. The PoC builds on top of two Linux Foundation projects – Parsec to abstract the root of trust attestation primitives, and Veraison to consume and verify the new evidence formats – and modifies mbedTLS to support a subset of the newly defined TLS extensions. As a hardware root of trust, the proof of concept is currently using a TPM2.0, with support for others being considered.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Unlock zero trust cloud-native security in Kubernetes</subtitle>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;StackRox integrates with every stage of the container lifecycle: build, deploy, and runtime. It has the ability to monitor, scan, and prevent the execution of vulnerable code, and container images in multiple and almost any flavor of your Kubernetes clusters that too from a single control plane. It plays a huge role in its supply chain security pattern by providing continuous scanning via CI/CD pipelines and integration with image registries so that vulnerable and misconfigured container images could be remediated within the same developer environment, with real-time feedback and alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this session, users will have a fair knowledge on:
- How StackRox in a cloud-native way could help to observe, analyze and react on 1:N Kubernetes clusters with minimal human efforts (1: Control Plane, N: Secured Kubernetes Clusters)
- How teams could reduce operational overhead and streamline security practices in large-scale environments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer or security admin, you might have questions like:
- What kind of tracing and monitoring is needed to determine potential threats in a large-scale cluster?
- How to ensure the code is being delivered through secured infrastructure?
- How one could proactively detect the vulnerabilities and secure the components as soon as they are affected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent of this session is to address these concerns and this would also emphasize on:
- How StackRox helps to shift left the security efforts for developers and security teams
- Glimpse of an Admission Controller detecting policy violations caused by insecure workloads
- Significance of eBPF nodes
- The DevSecOps model &amp;amp; supply chain security practices. Here, the demonstration would cover standard CI/CD definitions via Jenkins or ArgoCD that integrates with Kubernetes clusters where a security admin could keep the day2 security tasks in an auto-pilot mode and yet be able to maintain an end-to-end secured infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Digital Services Act 101 </title>
        <subtitle>What is it and why should you care</subtitle>
        <track>Mozilla</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Europe’s new rulebook to ensure safe, ethical and transparent online spaces, the Digital Services Act (DSA), entered into force on November 16th. In a few months, this regulation will apply to a range of digital services operating in the EU, from intermediary and hosting services to social media platforms and search engines. The DSA will require big changes from the biggest players in social media and search (those with over 45 million ‘active monthly users’ in the EU); content moderation capacities, data access transparency tools and annual audits will now be mandated and governed. This groundbreaking text is the first of its kind, and has already inspired both legislation and voluntary corporate practices around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lighting talk will speed through the major implications of the DSA and the changes big tech is likely to roll out in response.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 27, the Digital Services Act was published in the Official Journal of the EU, culminating years of legislative and advocacy effort. The regulation will impose a sweeping new regime imposing transparency and accountability requirements on digital services operating in the EU. The DSA is asymmetric in structure, with the largest obligations falling to the largest platforms and search engines - those with a systemic role in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these big players will need to
- improve content moderation capacity and reporting mechanisms
- provide access to data for vetted researchers
- assess and mitigate their systemic risks
- have annual third party audits
- abide by relevant codes of conduct
- ban targeted advertising on online platforms by profiling children or based on special categories of personal data such as ethnicity, political views or sexual orientation
- provide a recommender system not based on user profiling (under the GDPR definition)
- refrain from ‘dark patterns' on their interfaces&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and Meta’s gutting of its transparency tool Crowdtangle, the DSA is the EU’s promise to reset a big tech ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Like many programming communities, the Java community lacks a simple open-source profiling UI. In the quest to build such a UI, I found the Firefox Profiler to be the closest to an adaptable polyglot profiling UI. This talk presents my Java JFR Profiler plugin for IntelliJ and gives an overview of how to adapt and integrate the Firefox Profiler to use it to view profiling data from different sources, like JDK Flight Recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The internet is global, and its future is by no means written or spoken only in English. With the upcoming Intl.MessageFormat addition to JavaScript, we're making it easier than ever to write and maintain apps and systems that not only speak your language, but also the languages of your users. To do that, we're redefining how localisation really works, and building a system that's interoperable with all existing data formats, workflows and processes, as well as (hopefully!) all the ones we can't even imagine yet. Let me show you this new world, and where it might lead us.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At this meeting we'll sum up the state of affairs with Hare, our plans for the future, and encourage discussions with the community. We'll also demonstrate a few interesting Hare projects, including Helios, a micro-kernel written in Hare, and encourage each other to work on interesting projects in the Hare community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above the city. Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate to have them. But then something happens: when Zangemann wants to take another close-up look at his inventions during a walk through the city, a child hits him in the shin with the skateboard. That hurts! Enraged, the inventor makes a momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through what is going on. Together with her friends, she forges a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrated children's book (licensed under Creative Commons BY-SA) tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process realizes how crucial it is for her and others to control technology. Ada &amp;amp; Zangemann will inspire children's interest in tinkering and encourages shaping technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;"A rousing tale of self-reliance, community, and standing up to bullies...software freedom is human freedom!" —Cory Doctorow, Sci-Fi Author&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Introduces readers young and old to the power and peril of software. Behind it all is a backdrop of ethics of knowledge sharing upon which the arc of human history rides."  —Vint Cerf, Computer Scientist and One of the Inventors of the Internet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What a fun read! I recognize myself in Ada at many moments." —Isabela Fernandes, Executive Director, The Tor project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Even as a non-child, I was captivated by the story from the first page to the last. Kudos to the author for packaging difficult topics such as monopolies, lobbyism, digital divide, software freedom, digital autonomy, IoT, consumer control, e-waste and much more in a child-friendly form in an easily understandable and exciting storyline." —Jörg Luther, chief editor of the German Linux-Magazin, LinuxUser, Raspberry Pi Geek&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A cute story which resonates with kids and adults alike. The freedom to use &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; hardware and software as you see fit is a core ingredient in any technological society."
—Andrew Lewman, Freedom and Privacy Advocate, Chairman of Each One Teach One&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ada &amp;amp; Zangemann brings a highly topical, technically relevant subject to children." —Catharina Maracke, Chair of the Board, Open Source Initiative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In this hopeful story Ada and her friends join a movement that started back in 1983. Their courageous adventure of software freedom and learning how technology works is a wonderful way to introduce young people everywhere to the joys of tinkering!”  —Zoë Kooyman, Executive Director, Free Software Foundation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An explanation of the structure of any complex system becomes more easily digestible and less confusing if it is accompanied by simple and understandable diagrams. Different subject areas have their own ways of depicting objects. In the case of Kubernetes clusters, this task becomes very non-trivial. Traditional network diagrams are a poor fit for a container orchestrator; official emblems have features that require their careful and moderate use. Finally, the complexity of Kubernetes makes it very easy to overload a drawing with details. We will look at how Kubernetes clusters are usually drawn by various authors. It will show how auxiliary tools such as color coding, grouping, and eye anchoring can make the cluster diagram more understandable... and how not to get the opposite effect when drawing your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux container escapes continue to affect Kubernetes and derived
products. User namespaces are one technology that can mitigate the
risk. In this presentation I will explain the past, present and
future of user namespace support in Kubernetes, and discuss how to
run systemd-based containers in user namespaces. And why you would
even want to try. There will be demos!  Attendees will learn about
what containers are, the technologies that underpin Linux
containers, and how Kubernetes actually runs containers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;"systemd in a container? What! Why!?" We had our Reasons, and I'll
even explain them.  But more interesting than the "why" is the
"how", and that's what this talk is about.  Come and learn about the
upcoming and in-development Kernel and Kubernetes security features
that will enable better container isolation and secure deployment of
systemd-based workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a talk about what happened when a handful of complete
container newbies tried to port their massive, complex, legacy
application to Kubernetes.  As a monolithic container.  Based on
systemd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runtime shunned our container and refused to execute it.  Cloud
engineers recoiled in horror at our architecture.  With astounding
hubris we ignored their admonitions and doubled down.  If the
container runtime won't run our application, well, we'll just modify
the container runtime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so we did.  Our journey took us into the darkest corners of
container runtimes, Kubernetes and systemd.  And we have emerged to
tell you the tale.  There will be demos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn about the security technologies that underpin
Linux containers, including namespaces and cgroups, as well as the
behaviour of systemd in containers.  I will also discuss the recent
and planned changes in Kubernetes to provide official support for
running containers in user namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Fedora CoreOS is a basic, monolithic, automatically updating operating system that is optimised for running containers. It focuses on offering the best container host for executing containerized workloads securely and at scale. This fits perfectly the requirement for setting up a container-oriented self-hosted homelab and in this talk, we would detail that and go one (or more steps) further by providing a case study of setting up Fedora CoreOS as a self-hosted homelab distribution for globally accessible (using secure network tunnelling) multiplayer servers for video games (namely, Minecraft, Valheim etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;li&gt;Professional sysadmins who use Fedora CoreOS but want to know more applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budding community members wanting to contribute to the upstream projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux distribution users who are on the fence, about trying a different workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video game enthusiasts who run (or plan to run) their dedicated multiplayer servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-hosted homelab followers who maintain a home infrastructure as a hobby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software engineers or students who wish to learn sysadminship with Fedora CoreOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How is the target audience benefited?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional sysadmins (who already use Fedora CoreOS or similar distros) would learn about other creative applications like running a multiplayer server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budding community members would know how they can contribute to the upstream projects that provide a well-suited container-oriented distro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux distribution users would be helped with their decision by knowing the difference between the workflows used in regular distros and that in Fedora CoreOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video game enthusiasts would get bragging rights among their friends once understand (and apply) how to set up a multiplayer server seamlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-hosted homelab followers would obtain more insights on possible alternative operating systems like Fedora CoreOS for their current infrastructure setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software engineers or students would gain more information on where they can start from within the community (i.e. Fedora Infrastructure) with their learnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will showcase an open source solution for deploying Kubernetes clusters on hybrid and multi-cloud environments using the recently released OpenNebula Kubernetes Engine (OneKE). In this talk we will present to the world the new OneKE appliance, a CNCF-certified K8s distribution based on Rancher’s RKE2, and will explain how it has been expanded with a number of additional pre-installed open source components to handle persistence, ingress traffic, and on-premise load balancing. In this talk, we will also introduce OpenNebula’s native model for hybrid and multi-cloud computing, which allows a unified management of diverse workloads and applications leveraging resources from different public cloud and edge infrastructure providers. Participants will be able to see a demo, showing how to bring all those features and technologies together in order to launch and manage a multi-cluster Kubernetes deployment across Hybrid and Multi-Cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It's been almost 10 years since the demonstration of the earliest Docker client at PyCon in 2013. While container capabilities and tooling existed prior to Docker, we can all agree that the last 10 years has seen an explosion of tools, integrations, and production services all built on container runtime technologies similar to that early Docker engine project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that context, it's a good time to look around and survey the landscape of container developer tooling in use today. While Docker engine, and the companion Docker Desktop product are widely used, the creation of the OCI standards and the launching of the CNCF has allowed for a wide array of tools and projects that also provide developers tools and capabilities to create, build, and run containers and interoperate with container registries. In this talk we'll tour the current world of open source developer tools, including podman, the early simple containerd clients, nerdctl, and the advent of non-Linux platform support built alongside these tools, such as Rancher Desktop, Lima/colima, Finch, and Podman Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn a bit about each of the container developer tool platforms, what open source components they are built from, and how to see them in context with the other alternatives in this space. We'll demonstrate the similarities and differences, and show how thanks to the OCI specs, interoperability between these tools is guaranteed and that developers have significant choice when deciding what tools to use for local container development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It wasn't easy to reproduce the same container image from its Dockerfile, due to changes in timestamps and "aptgettable" package versions.
This lack of reproducibility has been a threat to the trustworthiness of container images and binary artifacts built inside containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Akihiro Suda will introduce the current work being done to enable reproducible builds in the Dockerfile ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will consist of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part will explain the current status of implementing the &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; specification [1] in BuildKit [2] for deterministic timestamps of rootfs files and OCI metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part will introduce a new tool called &lt;code&gt;repro-get&lt;/code&gt; [3] which can be used to deterministically install a specific snapshot of apt, dnf, apk, and pacman packages.
The packages are fetched by their SHA256 hash from various file providers including HTTP(S) sites, local filesystems, OCI registries, and even IPFS.
The repro-get tool is expected to be used for containers in conjunction with the &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; work, but it can also be useful in non-container environments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With Kubernetes 1.25 it is finally possible to checkpoint and restore containers. This offers new possibilities how to use containers in Kubernetes with the help of CRIU (Checkpoint Restore in Userspace). In this session I want to present possible use cases for checkpointing and restoring containers (including demos), how it is currently integrated in Kubernetes and how we plan to extend checkpoint and restore in Kubernetes over the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Containers are essential for microservices applications; In this talk, we'll talk about database containers, the construction process, and best practices when creating a database container. For example, we will use open-source databases and create a Dockerfile from scratch focusing on each layer of the databases.
Participants in this talk will learn the fundamentals behind containers, specifically database containers. Those who want to implement it will have enough information to build their database containers efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>Containers</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Seccomp has supported a notify target for a little while now.
This can be used to delegate system call handling to a userspace process.
Using this, it's possible to intercept any syscall (even a non-existing one) and have it be handled by a potentially more privileged userspace process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In LXD, we like running very safe containers. For that we use user namespaces by default, combined with both AppArmor and Seccomp policies.
The result are very very safe containers but because of all that security, a number of actions just aren't possible or return odd values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System call interception gives us a way out there as we can selectively intercept system calls such as mount, sysinfo, ebpf, ... then run them through policies and if found to be safe, run them again with elevated privileges.
We have been progressively growing the list of system calls that can be handled in that way with our eventual goal to complete deprecate the use of privileged containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we'll be covering the general concept behind system call interception through the seccomp notify mechanism, some of the things to be extremely careful about and show the ones we have implemented to this day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Bottlerocket OS - a container-optimized Linux</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Containers</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bottlerocket is a free and open source Linux distribution purpose-built for hosting
containers. Since its launch in 2020, Bottlerocket has been adopted by companies
large and small as a platform for running their containerized workloads in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has only what you need to run containers reliably, and is built with standard
open source components. Bottlerocket-specific additions focus on reliable
updates and on its management and configuration API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notable features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API access for configuring your system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast and reliable image-based system updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defense-in-depth protections such as a read only root filesystem, minimized attack surface, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built in integration with container orchestration platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of Bottlerocket, covering some of the
benefits of using a container-optimized OS. We will cover how
Bottlerocket is similar to general purpose Linux distributions and point out
the ways it is different. During the talk we'll get hands on and show what it
is like to use and administer Bottlerocket nodes. We will provide all the
details on how to get involved and participate in the community. We'd love
for you to join the Bottlerocket open source project&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For years there was this notion that Kubernetes secrets are inherently insecure. There are certainly concerns about how Kubernetes stores and handles secrets, but base64 encoding (that most people often call out) is not the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how Kubernetes attempts to secure secrets, frequently rotating those secrets is certainly a best practice. It also poses a huge challenge, especially when done manually in a highly distributed environment: ensuring secrets are rotated in time, everywhere without affecting availability without making mistakes is no job for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my presentation, I will explain why secret rotation is important, what challenges it poses and how to do it in a Kubernetes environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Squashfs images provides a read-only compressed filesystem. OCI content delivered in squashfs format provide several benefits when compared to tar. Images do not need to be extracted before being used. Images can be verified by their content-addressed names against signed OCI metadata before use, and dmverity will ensure the integrity of the contents themselves. This makes for very fast yet verified storage bringup. Overlay provides the ability to give writable access and take advantage of OCI’s layered images.
I’ll show how users can build (stacker), host (zot) and run squashfs images (LXC) with available opensource software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Operating Kubernetes clusters has never been easy. Managing the cluster lifecycle includes multiple aspects, starting from provisioning the underlying infrastructure to upgrading it. There is a possibility that the fleet of clusters will grow and potentially spread across multiple environments. How to keep all clusters under control? What if we use Kubernetes API for simplifying these tasks? Kubernetes is able to manage our container workloads, but it turns out it can also be extended to manage the lifecycle of multiple clusters. In this presentation, we will go over the fundamentals of cluster lifecycle management and how the Cluster API can help. We will do a deep dive into Cluster API building blocks and see a live demo of provisioning and upgrading clusters on various infrastructure providers. &lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>7 years of cgroup v2: the future of Linux resource control</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Containers</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Control groups (or cgroups for short) are one of the most fundamental technologies underpinning our modern love of containerisation and resource control. Back in 2016, we released a complete overhaul of how cgroups work internally: cgroup v2, released with Linux 4.5. This brought many new and exciting possibilities to increase system stability and throughput, but with those possibilities have also come challenges of a type which we have largely not faced in Linux before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will go into some of the challenges faced in overhauling Linux's resource isolation and control capabilities, and how we've gone about fixing them. This will include some of the most complex and counter-intuitive practical effects we've seen in production, with details of how our expectations and knowledge have developed over the last 5 years using this on over a million machines in production, with insights that are immediately applicable to anyone who runs Linux at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will also go over the state-of-the-art of resource control in the "real world" outside of companies like Meta and Google, looking at how cgroup v2 is changing the technical landscape for distributions and containerisation technologies for the better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Lightweight Kubernetes Operators with WebAssembly</title>
        <subtitle>Towards serverless Kubernetes controllers</subtitle>
        <track>Containers</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We created a prototype that runs Kubernetes operators in WebAssembly (wasm) and suspends them to disk when they are not used. This greatly reduces the memory overhead of the Kubernetes control plane. It also works towards a serverless k8s control plane where controllers scale to zero when not needed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly (wasm) is a binary format to run applications in lightweight virtual machines. Many compilers support wasm as a target next to arm and x86_64. The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a standardized API for wasm apps to talk to the outside world. They’re the “System Calls” of the WebAssembly world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining these two gives you a very lightweight but very secure way to isolate applications. Each wasm app runs in their own sandbox and the runtime decides what external resources it can access. Moreover, wasm apps start up lightning fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proof of concepts builds on the initial work of Markus Thömmes and Francesco Guardiani, who introduced the idea of running Kubernetes controllers in WebAssembly. We ported this work to wasmtime and added the ability to unload controllers when they're not being used. Our results show controllers running in wasm use up to 68% less memory compared to containerd. Moreover, by unloading the controllers when they're not needed, the controllers use an additional 50% less memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it a cool idea to understand societies of interstellar civilization? While this may look like a fictional scenario, I believe academically serious studies can be done through simulations. Because special relativity plays a role in this scenario, it is not a strict forward task to implement interstellar social model using existing social simulation framework. As a result, I have created an open source simulation framework, Relativitization, to ease the model development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will introduce the architecture of the framework and how the framework can be used. Besides that, I will introduce a complex social model, a.k.a., a turn-based strategy game, developed based on the framework. I believe the game is useful for educating relativistic physics to the public. As a Ph.D. student in social science with a background in physics, developing an open source software is a challenging process. I will also share my experience in overcoming the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Matlab + Simulink is a very powerful tool. This tool allows engineers to simulate real devices. In open sources, some tools exist, such as Scilab + Xcos.
With the growing community of Python, some tools appeared: NumPy, SciPy... Those tools intend to propose a Matlab alternative environment equivalent for Python.
MuPhyN is an interface that is intended to reproduce the Simulink capabilities. The goal is to produce a community-based simulation software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is based on a Qt interface and uses a simulator core. It is fully written in Python and uses YAML as the descriptive language. The library feature proposed allows users to add as many boxes and schedulers as they want.
The already created boxes take advantage on the SciPy and NumPy libraries to produce their behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation illustrates how the Guix project provides software deployment for reproducible research.  GNU Guix takes care about the computational environment from the package management to producing container (Docker, Singularity) and also being an alternative for virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open science means transparent and collective; transparent because a scientific result needs to be scrutinized and studied bug-to-bug, and collective because an independent observer must observe the same result–at least when speaking about computational processing–and this observation needs to be sustainable.  Guix is an attempt to implement, for the computational environment, these two items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By applying functional programming concepts to package management, pioneered by Nix, Guix is deeply transparent by design.  The whole computational environment is captured and its inspection, from source code to binary, becomes tractable.  As a nice consequence, this computational environment is reproducible from one machine to another.  What about missing source code?  Guix is able to transparently fallback to the Software Heritage archive.  The reproduction of this computational environment becomes sustainable–to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this presentation try to convince how Guix and 3 command lines can helps open science.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is an interim report on a journey to enhance scientific programming in Python within the French social sciences. Scientific programming is a stepstone to develop open and reproductible data projects. In numerous field, tools and libraries were developed thanks to Python to become standards. Backed by detailed documentations, those tools diffuse beyond specialties and frontiers and opens new prospects. Nevertheless, social sciences in France seem to stand appart. One reason may be the precedence of R as a programming langage, with highly specialized libraries lacking sometime of documentation or update. Another one may be the diversity of traditions, data and approaches that can hinder shared practices and ease of use of existing libraries. Based on the experience of a small Python library - PySHS - and the organization of training sessions, I will argue that there is a need (and space) for an high-level and easy to use scientific programming framework in Python dedicate to social sciences that can bridge current practices with the state of the art libraries. Such library could in return help to clarify methodologies. This opens two main question that should be addressed : first, how to maintain the flexibility of scientific programming against overtly specialized tools ; second : how to build a meta-framework with other programming langages as R to avoid fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Crowdsourced datasets starts to become common, we can cite the Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects or the OpenStreetMap database as well known examples. The UMRAE research lab collect data from thousands users around the world with its &lt;a href="https://noise-planet.org/noisecapture.html"&gt;NoiseCapture application&lt;/a&gt;.
Assess the quality of the sound spectrum recorded by hundreds of differents smartphones models is a challenge by itself and people are working on it. But in the mean time, we ask ourself if we can extract information from the tags provided by the users.
This talk will present the 2017 - 2020 collection dataset, the analysis of the recordings' tags and the complete FOSS toolset we used. We will present the challenges we faced, the solutions we found and the issues we will have to mitigate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Disinformation on has become a crucial issue for our democracies, nowadays. This presentation, based on a real use case will show how to efficiently identify the real owner of a disinformation website by using OSINT techniques based on open-source software. We will also present the methodology and tools we used to better understand the ecosystem of disinformation this website evolves in, its influence out of the far-right social platforms, and the financial motivation of its creator behind the scene.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PIMMI is a Python software that performs visual mining in a corpus of images. Its main objective is to find all copies, total or partial, in large volumes of images and to group them together. Our initial goal is to study the reuse of images on social networks (typically, our first use is the propagation of memes on Twitter). However, we believe that its use can be much wider and that it can be easily adapted for other studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of PIMMI are therefore:
- ability to process large image corpora, up to several millions files
- robustness to some modifications of the images (crop, zoom, composition, addition of text, ...)
- adaptability to different use cases (mainly the nature and volume of the image corpus)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study using PIMMI will generally be broken down into several steps:
1. constitution of a corpus of images (jpg and/or png files) and their metadata
2. choice of PIMMI parameters according to the criteria of the corpus
3. indexing the images with PIMMI and obtaining clusters of reused images
4. exploitation of the clusters by combining them with the descriptive metadata of the images&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of this software is still in progress and we warmly welcome beta-testers, feedback, proposals for new features and even pull requests!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Driving research based on large collection of data often demands in the humanities a strong collaboration between researchers and data engineers.
Data are the corner stone on which the research is based.
Caring about our research data is not only a good practice to drive and open our research, it's also a good way to foster collaboration between researchers and engineers.
In this talk we will present how, in a Digital Humanities research project, controlling the data quality and structure through a frictionless data package leverage the a great data productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "Data flowing the right way" that was due to have been given by María Arias de Reyna, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend the conference.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CorTexT Platform is the digital platform of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Science, Innovation and Society (LISIS) held in Paris. This platform aims at empowering open research and studies in social sciences about the dynamic of science, technology, innovation and knowledge production. It covers a large variety of methodological research fields, such as scientometrics, Social Networks Analysis, Natural Language Processing and spatial analysis. Its web application gathers most of the original methods produced by the platform team members (https://www.cortext.net/members/).
Twelve years after its creation, CorTexT Manager is facing a growth of its usages: in number of users, type of institutions, and locations of the users. Back in 2021, more than 1300 active users came to analyze data on it, producing more than 66 000 calculations, from a wide variety of organizations (laboratories, government agencies, firms, newspapers...) located in 60 countries across the world. In 2019, our users were coming from 39 different countries. In the meantime, scientific production published using one or more sets of methods accessible through CorTexT Manager has nearly doubled: a total of 67 scientific documents citing or mentioning CorText Manager has been identified for 2021 (https://www.cortext.net/publications/).
Addressing these changes has required significant transformations of CorTexT Manager: both for its technical infrastructure as well as for how its codebase is produced and its academic visibility. This presentation will give a brief overview of what is CorTexT Manager and focus on: the importance of user documentation for scientific reproducibility, questions related to the ownership and copyright of the source code when engineers and developers are supported by multiple research organizations, and how to ensure its academic visibility.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The twitter-explorer is an open-source research tool that allows users without programming skills to collect, transform and visualize Twitter data through the paradigm of networks.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The twitter-explorer is an open-source research tool that allows users without programming skills to collect, transform and visualize Twitter data through the paradigm of networks. It represents different types of platform-specific interaction patterns (retweet, mention, quote, reply) as interactively explorable networks, 2D-spatialized through a force-directed layout algorithm. The tool, and more specifically its interactive aspect, which allows users to read tweets of users from within the network visualization, was built out of a necessity to go back to the actual data in order to understand why certain nodes find themselves in the position they are in. We call this process "guided close-reading": the structural overview given by the spatialized network allows the social scientist to find, sort and then analyze relevant content through traditional methods from discourse analysis in order to generate hypotheses about the underlying debate on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I would mainly like to discuss the intricacies of tool-building for the social sciences, more specifically the use and interpretability of force-directed layout algorithms, as well as get feedback on the architecture of the tool itself, which is written in Python and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The story of this talk starts eight years ago, with the creation of a mapping-interface [1] to explore one of the fined grained statistical dataset on the french population (number of inhabitants / km²,  the average income per consumption unit, the percentage of low-income households, ...). These data were derived from localized tax revenues of households and were available in a very fine way i.e on pixels of only 200m x 200m, they were delivered at this time by the French National Institute of Statstics (INSEE) throught a massive spatial data file, which limited their use to a very limited number of people able to handle it. The proposed interface changed this and allowed almost any-body to visualize easily these data in their browser. In this presentation we will mainly discuss how to make such massive spatial data easily accessible to the public. The proposed solution is based on multi-scale aggregation: at high scales, the data are aggregated and at fine scales the final resolution of 200m by 200m is recovered. This interface, which heavily rely on zoom in/zoom out interactions allows users to deal and play with one of the well known problem in geography and spatial statistics namely the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [2] (ie. Data tabulated for different spatial scale levels or according to different zonal systems for the same region will not provide consistent analysis results). This tool has leads to several interactions with new users (journalist, researchers, simple citizen,...) that seem to demonstrate its interest. Since this first project, several other massive datasets (one concerning an updated of the same data-set and one concerning a dataset on all french building) were made available with almost the same system [3,4]. From a technical perspective, this talk will covers the different evolution and open-sources projects that has made this project possible (d3 / postgres / postgis / mapLibre,Leaflet, ...), discussing vector tiles formats, map viewer evolution and a little bit of spatial databases and the development of a little python tool to help other build the same type of visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Executable papers in the Humanities, or how did we land to the Journal of Digital History</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scientific articles built on executable notebooks are already common in the domain of scientific publication, where they are an effective tool that brings transparency and openness in research communication (FAIR). However, they’re not yet widely praised in the humanities.
Luckily, in the digital humanities, Jupyter notebooks play an important role in data analysis and exploration. They provide a free, powerful and open source platform for analyzing text corpora and other datasets in many programming languages - Julia, Python and R; they flawlessly integrate the browsers and many JavaScript data visualization libraries.
In general, digital humanists know very well how to make use of Jupyter notebooks to quickly create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
That’s why we naturally decided to work on Jupyter notebooks when we started playing with the idea of funding a Journal for digital historians in conjunction with the publisher DeGruyter. Developed by the C²DH (Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History and DeGruyter, the Journal of Digital History (https://journalofdigitalhistory.org) now publishes peer-reviewed, open access articles that are Jupyter notebooks in their essence.
With a difference: we wanted authors to reflect on their use of algorithms and digital methods, so we asked them to write their articles as compositions of three layers: narrative, data and hermeneutics.
In our presentation we will explore the ecosystem of tools and methods we have prepared together with the authors: GitHub, Docker, MyBinder, Zotero. We will present the process we follow with them from scratch notebooks to published multi-layered, reproducible scientific articles.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Turing Way is an open-source, community-led, and collaboratively developed project on making data science and research skills accessible, comprehensible, and beneficial for a wider research community. We bring together individuals from diverse fields and expertise to develop practices and learning resources that can make data research comprehensible and useful for everyone, as well as translate these tools and ways of working across cultural and disciplinary contexts. These resources are organised as an online book with over 250 chapters across five guides on reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication and ethics in research. This talk will introduce The Turing Way project, and invite participants to get involved. All questions, comments, recommendations, and discussions are facilitated through an online GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Looking back at 4 years of Open research tools and technologies devroom, we propose an open discussion on what's been done and what's to do. The panel will be held by the devroom organisers and will present a brief wrap-up of the 2023 edition, before opening the floor to the attendance. We are looking for feedback regarding the event itself, and inputs about its part in the community. Where are we, and where should we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The commonalization of desktop, phone &amp;amp; tablet, with the goal of providing the most user-friendly shell to the hands of users. With years of development behind it and a strong community of enthusiasts around it, Lomiri is well positioned to provide a delightful experience to both power users as well as ordinary users, powered by future-proof technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation he will demonstrate how over the last 5 years Ubuntu Touch convergence has evolved from vision to reality. Switching from the custom windowing protocol it used to a commonly shared one, adapting to the defacto-standard systems layer for GNU/Linux systems, software pieces that work in tandem to provide UI features such as workspaces with window snapping and resolution specific window scaling, and managing app lifecycles in a scenario-based way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AMENDMENT Sharp photos and short movies on a mobile phone</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>FOSS on Mobile Devices</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Phones running Linux became reality in last few years, and they do have cameras, but taking sharp and correctly exposed photos is still not easy, and neither is recording even short movies. I'm trying to change that, and have some successes I'd like to talk about, but there is more work are more challenges in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three major platforms available today: PinePhone, Librem 5 and PinePhone Pro. PinePhone includes "smart" camera sensor, which is able to do auto-exposure, auto-focus and JPEG compression on its own. Capturing good photos is relatively simple using Megapixels. Capturing 2MP, 30fps video is possible with some "interesting" solutions I'll describe. Librem 5 is much more interesting. It includes dumb 13MP sensor, with support for phase-detection auto focus. Auto-exposure and auto-focus needs to be done in software, with auto-focus being quite complex and requiring different solutions based on use case. I do have unoptimized solutions for auto-exposure and auto-focus in Millipixels project, but they really belong to libcamera. It is possible to capture 0.8MP, 20fps movie. There's really more work to be done on all sides, including kernel -- bayer10 support, caching, libcamera and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was originially scheduled to be given at 13:10. The talk originally in this slot, "Writing a convergent application in 2023 with Kirigami" by Carl Schwan will now take place at 13:10.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Mobian: to stable... and beyond!</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>FOSS on Mobile Devices</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 3 years, Mobian has grown from a one-person hobby project to one of the main actors in the mobile Linux community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we're preparing for the upcoming release of Debian 12 (bookworm), and the first Mobian stable release (shortly) following it, we want to share our plans for this transition and the future of Mobian and Debian on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back when Debian 11 (bullseye) was released, both the Mobian project and the mobile ecosystem were still young and lacked maturity. We therefore chose to stay an in-development, rolling-release-like distribution based on Debian testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward 2 years, Linux-based mobile phones have become more and more usable, the ecosystem has gained a lot of maturity and the Mobian team has been working towards reducing our delta with upstream Debian, both through upstream contributions and by maintaining Mobian packages directly in Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We feel it is now time to switch to a more usual (at least in the Debian world) stable+testing release and development scheme, and will detail during this talk how we plan to do so. We will more specifically emphasize our past and present contributions to Debian, as well as our goals and plans for the next development cycle (trixie).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Sailing into the Linux port with Sony Open Devices </title>
        <subtitle>A journey of adapting Sailfish OS to work on Sony Xperia phones </subtitle>
        <track>FOSS on Mobile Devices</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sailfish OS is an embedded Linux distribution developed by Jolla that’s designed to run primarily on phones. In this presentation I’ll talk about my journey porting Sailfish OS to various Xperia phones, via the Sony Open Devices Program, and how that’s made it possible to contribute changes upstream. If you’ve ever wondered what’s involved in porting a Linux operating system like Sailfish OS to a new hardware platform, or might even be interested to try, then this talk will describe one of the easiest routes to getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sailfish OS is an embedded Linux distribution developed by Jolla that’s designed to run primarily on phone and tablet hardware. The Sailfish community has a proud hardware adaptation track record, having ported Sailfish OS to devices as wide ranging as watches, feature phones, smartphones, tablets and PC hardware. Despite the breadth of successful ports, the process of adapting Linux to a new phone platform can be daunting for new porters. On the other hand, the Sony Open Devices Program makes the process of opening up a selection of Sony’s Xperia mobile phones for use by porters as easy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I’ll look at the process of porting Sailfish OS to Sony Open Device Program devices, see how the Open Devices Program helps in practice, and also look at some of the tools, documentation and infrastructure made available by Jolla to help with this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk about my own journey as a porter, how I came to start porting and the work I’m doing now porting Sailfish OS to different Sony Xperia devices. I’ll also talk about how Sailfish porters are able to work with the Sony Open Devices Program for mutual benefit, pushing changes upstream that then flow back down to make porting Sailfish OS or other Linux variants to other Xperia phones in the Open Devices Program more streamlined and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will aim to provide enough technical detail so that developers who haven’t yet tried porting can go away and get started, but will also aim to include material that is of general interest to more casual mobile phone and Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered what the process of porting Linux to a new hardware platform involves, might even be interested in trying it yourself, then this talk will offer some essential groundwork and highlight one of the easiest routes to getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kirigami is a QML based framework to build convergent user interface for both desktop and mobile devices.
It was created by Marco Martin in 2015 and has been contently evolving across the years becoming more mature and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While not being the maintainer of Kirigami, I developed several small and large applications with it, like Kalendar, NeoChat, Kalendar and Tokodon and I am also regularly contributing to Kirigami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to be able to give a good overview of the major changes Kirigami received. How this had an impact on how to write applications with Kirigami and how applications developed with Kirigami helped Kirigami to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was originially scheduled to be given at 11:00. The talk originally in this slot, "Sharp photos and short movies on a mobile phone" by Pavel Machek will now take place at 11:00.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Can Genode on the PinePhone question the notion of a smartphone?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>FOSS on Mobile Devices</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The PinePhone appeals to those of us who seek autonomy from dominant platform corporations. The talk introduces a new operating system for the PinePhone that is not based on Linux but on Genode. With such an unorthodox underpinning, we found ourself inspired to reimagine the dual notion of the phone as a highly dependable and secure appliance, and as a host for general-purpose applications. The talk will give an overview of Genode, present technical tidbits, and of course demonstrate the OS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine our society without smartphones. With the convenience of those handy companions, however, comes the dependence from platform providers who curate, manage, and update the devices for us. This central role has become an incredible leverage for the platform vendors, like Google and Apple. Those of us who want to escape the reach of those powerful corporations find the prospect of openness and transparency of the PinePhone hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the PinePhone is primarily meant for the use with Linux, it deserves more than one operating system kernel! Driven by the vision of a truly trustworthy smartphone, we have built a custom operating system for the PinePhone. Its uncompromising architecture is a radical departure from existing Linux-based systems. It combines microkernel technology, capability-based security, sandboxed device drivers, and custom system-control-processor firmware with a new user interface that diverges from the beaten track in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk by Genode developer Norman Feske will present the outcome of the past two years of intensive development, touching topics ranging from energy management, over voice telephony and mobile-data connectivity, up to applications like the Morph web browser. It goes without saying that the talk wouldn't be complete without showing the new OS in action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During the last few years we've seen no less than 2 phones ship with Linux installed out of the box, a large uptick in the number of Linux distributions targeting mobile devices, and big improvements to the usability of user interfaces and apps on mobile devices. But as the band Chicago once said, "where do we go from here?" This talk won't provide any definitive answers for what comes next, but hopes to introduce some ideas for what the community can do so that Linux Mobile continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>DNS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Zone parsers, like other parsers, are mostly sequential. To improve zone loading performance NLnet Labs researched ways to tune the process for much higher throughput. We analyze why current parsers are relatively slow and present ideas to leverage data parallelism (Single Instruction Multiple Data, or SIMD) and adjacent technologies to achieve a performance of (eventually, hopefully) GB/s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the focus is on parsing, vectorization has a much wider area of application.
We hope to familiarize (DNS) developers with vectorization concepts and show performance can be improved by taking a slightly different programming approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "External DNS Operator in Kubernetes" that was due to have been given by Servesha who sadly could not make it)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>DNS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A fully distributed network does not have - by definition - a central authority. Nevertheless overlay networks, like I2P ("Invisible Internet Project") do have the need for a DNS. Also, by definition, there is nothing like trust between peers of such a network. Typically such a problem might be solved using a distributed storage layer driven by a byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm. Students of the Lucerne University of Applied Science and Arts created mid December 2022 a prototype solution including an API.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation has the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short introduction to the concept of the I2P network and its b32 naming space (3')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation: Why the I2P network needs a DNS (4')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup: the tools, a distributed layer to store data and an I2P test network (3')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byzantine Fault Tolerance as consensus algorithm (2')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and usage of the DNS API for I2P (5')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and outlook (3')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion: feedback from DNS devs (10')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;summary of common C library calls to translate name to IP address(es) and back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have getaddrinfo() calls and nsswitch modules for different name resolution backends. But they provide blocking only calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BSD sockets allows hundreds or thousands concurrent connections from a single thread application. But resolving 4 different names in parallel is difficult from a single thread application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we have common GUI application loops for GLib or Qt, why we lack API integrating with them well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of GUI applications should avoid blocking calls in main thread today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it necessary to block on name resolution? How name resolution works and why I think asynchronous calls would work as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why using just raw DNS libraries might not be a solution for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use .local zone plugin nss-mdns as example why a simple to use API for name resolution is needed not only for unicast DNS queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle LLMNR protocol and not break other things, which happens with current systemd-resolved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At NLnet Labs, we worked on creating an API and prototype implementation for 'connectbyname', library function that takes as input a (DNS) name and returns a TLS connection. The idea is to work towards a standard API for such a function, that can internally use asynchronous DNS lookups, implement Happy Eyeballs, support DANE, SVCB/HTTPS, encrypted client hello, etc. I will present the various prototype implementation we created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this work we found that supporting the many new DNS connection types (DNS
 over TLS, DNS over HTTPS, DNS over QUIC) from within a library is creating a nu
mber of problems. To deal with this problem, we created a new EDNS(0) option called Proxy Control option, that allows stub resolvers to send requirements to a local proxy. I will present this option and how it can help to keep DNS stub resolvers simple.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>a DNS server/forwarder/cache for the Internet of Threads</subtitle>
        <track>DNS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;iothnamed is a DNS server/forwarder/cache for the Internet of Threads supporting hash based IPv6 addresses and OTIP, i.e. one time IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hash based IPv6 addresses:
The host part of an IPv6 address can be computed as the result of a hash function computer on the fully qualified domain name.
This eases the life of system administrators dealing with IPv6 networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Time IP:
OTIP means that the current IP address of a server changes periodically to prevent networking attacks. This method has mainly been designed for IPv6 networks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hash Based IPv6 address:
The configuration of an IPv6 network is a rather daunting and error-prone procedure for system administrators. Each node must be provided with its own (128 bit long) IPv6 address and with a domain name manageable by human beings.
Autoconfiguration methods can give addresses to interfaces but do not provide any means of configuring the DNS. So autoconfiguration is suitable for clients. If a host has to act as a server, it must have a fully qualified domain name and the DNS service has to map its name to its IP address.
In the Internet of Thread scenario, the number of network nodes can be orders of magnitude higher than before, as each process or thread can be a node. This idea of hash based IPv6 addresses is a viable solution to the problem to manage the DNS resolution in IoTh environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Time IP:
Hosting servers use a finite number of IP addresses to connect on the net. Attackers can collect those by wiretapping the network and create a catalog of valid addresses and services in order to attack the servers. OTIP can prevent these attacks, or make them harder to succeed as the addresses collected by network sniffers expire in a short time. OTIP aims to provide one further layer of protection for private services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Drink authoritative server was created both to have dynamic answers (such as the IP address of the resolver) and to be used as a platform for DNS experimentation. The talk will present its internal implementation and the choices made.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Drink is written in Elixir and makes use of several Elixir strengths, notably the parallelism, which is very important for a DNS server. Also, writing an Internet server means dealing with broken (or downright hostile) clients so robustness is important. We will discuss the technical decisions, their consequences, and the remaining problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you can't find a service provider that meets all of your requirements, and you know that there is open source software which can meet them, but you'll have to take on the task of deploying and maintaining it yourself. This talk is about my journey to provide a fully-featured DNS service for my personal domains, using PowerDNS Authoritative Server, at very low cost and without subscribing to any 'big tech' services where I would be the product and not the customer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, fully-featured includes DNSSEC with online signing, DNS UPDATE (RFC 2136) support (primarily used for ACME DNS-01 challenges for Let's Encrypt certificates), SVCB/HTTPS records, and more. The talk will also cover the way that I use Ansible to manage zones and their content in the authoritative servers, using Ansible modules I created and published. As a bonus, I'll also talk about how I manage recursive resolvers on my LANs with the ability to resolve names from my own domains even if Internet connectivity is lost, and with nearly immediate updates when the zone contents are changed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will go into the difficulties I encountered trying to move TransIP from its own proprietary DNS solution "TransDNS" to an open source solution.
Topics for the talk are:
- Why we had a closed source solution in the first place
- Problems caused by RFC non-compliance, specifically related to wildcard handling
- Missing features in the selected OSS solution (PowerDNS) and how we fixed them
- How we tested and rolled out the final solution
- Scaling issues we ran into once it was deployed and how we solved them&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;DNS, like almost any protocol or system on the internet, has been used in ways almost from the day it was born that were probably never intended or envisioned by its inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is an overview of some of the more interesting ways that people have thought to embrace and extend DNS, from large to small.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From static traceroutes to fully-fledged companies using entire protocols based on top of the DNS, there are a hundred different ways where creative people have seen ways to bend it to their will. While a lot of these are now sadly confined to history, taking a look at some of these inventions is always fun and can often be educational. DNS tools, DNS toys, DNS tunneling, and DNS filesystems, are just some of the examples of uses and misuses that we'll take a look at.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS) is unjust like proprietary software</title>
        <subtitle>Thinking carefully about services</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SaaSS means using a service implemented by someone else as a substitute for running your copy of a program for a computing activity that is entirely your own. It is explained in detail at https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Services where the code is published as free software provides a huge mitigation to SaaSS, but to keep your software freedom, you need to identify it and avoid using it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will first explain some finer points of SaaSS going beyond what is written on gnu.org. I will introduce the concept of the primary purpose of using a service and incidental computing. We will evaluate what parts of some popular services are SaaSS. I will introduce an edge case as an example that the line is not always black and white. The audience will gain confidence in evaluating services they encounter for whether any parts are SaaSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been relatively little attention paid to SaaSS, but it is on the rise especially with AI services. I will suggest some practical cases and approaches for raising the issue of SaaSS. Is there a simpler way to put it? Maybe "That kind of service should only run on your own computer as free software."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing free sources for non-SaaSS services is also important and warrants some discussion. If most services aren't SaaSS, why does the FSF recommend the AGPL for all service software? Users of services and society at large deserve the sharing of service software for reasons other than SaaSS which I will discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Various cases about the refund of pre-installed software, and the right to install any software on any device</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;On 2018 Luca purchases a Lenovo Tablet/PC and, since it comes with Microsoft Windows pre-installed, he requested the refund to Lenovo, but Lenovo denied to refund Luca. A court case was initiated, and Lenovo was condemned to pay a punitive damages of 20000 euros for its abusive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After this "historic" case, some other refund were request to other companies, such as HP, Dell, Microsoft, Acer, and again to Lenovo. Each OEM tried to deny the refund, with various reasons such as contractual clauses contained in the sale contract or in the same license agreement, or the need to delete the Product Key stored in the MSDM BIOS ACPI table and therefore they require to send the PC to their laboratories.
These reasons have no valid legal basis, because – at least in Italy – the license agreement is a contract totally unrelated to the sale contract, so a third party may not impose any action on your material good, and the license agreement has remained without causal and economic justification, because not accepted and missed to be concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As the legal industry more readily leverages software for tools, automation, and predictive analytics, it has increased the affordable access to justice and legal services for underserved populations, helping make information and knowledge available for all. FOSS has and will continue to play a critical role in this evolution, but the line between where such software's functionality ends and the practice of law begins remains fuzzy. This presentation will discuss some of the legal precedent around Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) enforcement related to software, and will explore how current and future UPL enforcement may align or conflict with FOSS principles.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digital autonomy has been at the heart of the public policy debate in the EU for a while now, with Commissioner Thierry Breton himself stating in 2021 that “in the digital decade, Open Source will be a key element to achieve Europe’s resilience and digital sovereignty”. In this session, which will also include an open debate with the audience, we will analyze the opportunities for open source when it comes to contributing to building Europe’s technological sovereignty, but also the challenges that this new policy landscape poses for the open source ecosystem in Europe (and beyond).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gaël Blondelle joined the Eclipse Foundation in 2013 and now serves as Chief Membership Officer. He has been involved in the open source arena for more than 18 years in a number of key roles. Gaël co-founded an open source start-up and worked as its Chief Technology Officer. Gaël then worked in business development for an open source systems integration company and managed highly strategic research IT projects aiming to create open source ecosystems for major industrial players. Gaël joined the Eclipse Foundation to pursue his goal of helping more companies work in open source, and to implement open, innovative and collaborative ecosystems for mission-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto P. Martí has developed most of his career in Spain and in the UK, both in the IT sector and in Academia. As VP of Open Source Innovation at OpenNebula Systems, he deals with strategic collaborations with public cloud/edge providers, open source initiatives, and development teams from other tech vendors. Alberto coordinates the SovereignEdge.EU initiative and is involved in both the IPCEI-CIS and the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud, where he supports the role of OpenNebula Systems as chairing company of the Cloud/Edge Working Group while co-leading one of its Task Forces. Alberto is particularly interested in the conjunction between open source, ethical innovation, and digital sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Financing Open Source projects has been one of the main difficulties for years. Currently, well-funded projects usually depend on a small number of big companies. Donations from physical persons (and users) are also a common revenue source. Hundreds (thousands?) of small companies are using Open Source in Europe. Regularly donating only a small amount can make a difference for many projects they depend on. Marta will share the experience of giving by a small company in France with the list of "DOs and DON'Ts."&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Open Source Initiative is working on making improvements to its license review process and has a set of recommendations for changes it is considering making, available [link to be provided]. This session will review the proposed changes and also take feedback from the participants on what it got right, what it got wrong, and what it might have missed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The License Review Working Group of the Open Source Initiative was created to improve the license review process. In the past, the process has been criticized as unpredictable, difficult to navigate, and applying undisclosed requirements. The Working Group developed a set of recommendations for revising the process for reviewing and approving or rejecting licenses submitted to the OSI. The recommendations include separate review standards for new and legacy licenses, a revised group of license categories, and some specific requirements for license submissions. The recommendations are available [link to be provided] and the OSI is in the feedback stage of its process, seeking input on the recommendations. The session will review the proposed changes and also take feedback from the participants on what it got right, what it got wrong, and what it might have missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the following is out of scope for the Working Group:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning From the Big Failures To Improve FOSS Advocacy and Adoption</title>
        <subtitle>How Are Big Companies Benefiting So Much from FOSS, and Individuals So Little?</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After thirty years of FOSS advocacy, issue and problems in approach have begun to emerge.  Strategic mistakes in approach to new technologies has often led to large areas of software endeavor to remain proprietary. While for-profit companies have been rewarded with great efficiency benefits and other perks from their adoption of FOSS, rarely do these benefits trickle down to consumers and end-users in their daily computing lives.  This talk examines our past mistakes in advocacy and activism, and considers what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since its advent in the late 1980s, the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community now has more than thirty years of experience in strategies for advocacy and encouraging adoption of FOSS.  Results have, unfortunately, been mixed.  While corporate adoption by for-profit companies has led to a boon and integration of FOSS into most corporate practices, the true promise of software rights and freedoms — the ability of individual hobbyist and consumers to participate on equal footing with the largest software producers in the world — mostly eludes our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk examines the wins, losses and challenges that FOSS advocacy has faced in the last thirty years.  We'll explore how failures to foresee both web application deployment and the advent of advertising-based app-oriented software deployment led to serious strategic errors in advocacy and focus of attention.  Many of these problems remain difficult to address, and only frank discussion among activists will reveal new approaches to continue a vibrant FOSS community into the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reckoning with new app store changes: Is now our chance?</title>
        <subtitle>Recent legal and policy developments around app stores and what they mean for free software</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2022, we saw growing concerns around app stores as run by Apple,
Google, and Microsoft -- and meaningful legislative and regulatory
interest. The concerns came from many different directions, including
privacy, antitrust, gatekeeping decisions, and platform exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll discuss this recent activity with a focus on how it all has
impacted or may impact user freedom. I'll survey the responses we've
seen from free software projects and organizations, and share insights
about current app store terms in relation to free software licenses
(especially copyleft), and alternative models of distribution like
F-Droid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will lead to an assessment of what this all means for the future
-- are there opportunities for the free software movement to get more
involved in influencing ongoing policy conversations that could
dramatically impact our future, and our ability to get free software
into the hands of users?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How to get public administrations to use more FOSS</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The strength of FOSS lies in their corresponding licenses. Public
administrations however sometimes have a hard time wrapping their
heads around the specifics of FOSS licenses although they more and
more understand the advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we want to illustrate the underlying reasons for the
existing problems and present ideas how the procurement of FOSS can be
improved and made easier for all those involved. We combine this with
an outlook to the impending changes and developments with regard to
the public procurement of FOSS in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When procuring software the German administration usually works with
standardized model contracts (the so-called EVB-IT) which are not
ideally designed for the procurement of FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022 members of the Open Source Business Alliance performed a
number of workshops with the German Ministry of Interior that
maintains the EVB-IT in order to remove existing barriers and to
eventually reform these standardized model contracts. Additionally a
survey among members of the Open Source Business Alliance revealed
typical recurring practical problems that companies face when offering
Open Source Software or corresponding services to public
administrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The European Union adopted its Budget for the next year in November 2022. The EU 2023 Budget was amended to include the pilot project “De-monopolized access to EU applications”.  The project, as tabled by Marcel Kolaja, (Member of the European Parliament, Czech Pirate Party) aims at asking EU institutions to release their apps in repositories
that constitute alternatives to major app stores like Apple App Store and Google Play, and to release the source code of the apps. The presentation will explain the pilot project, will explore potential opportunities for FOSS communities, and invite on the same panel F-Droid to bring in the first perspective from their side.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The coming EU Standard-Essential Patents regulation</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, the European Commission will publish its proposal for a regulation on Standard-Essential Patents (SEPs) to address issues of legal uncertainty, the vulnerability of SMEs, and transaction costs. This regulation could bring some peace of mind, or it could make matters worse. While software patents are not enforced by courts in Europe, the European patent offices continue to grant software patents. And with the Unified Patent Court (UPC) possibly coming in 2023, European software developers are not safe from patent uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will outline the European Commission's motivations, the input they're working from and the solutions they're considering. The Commission mentions FRAND licensing terms among the solutions, but, is it thinking of a type of FRAND licensing that truly doesn't discriminate against free software? We will discuss definitions for FRAND which could give real protections for free software and we will look into precedents which could be used as a basis for protecting the use, development and distribution of software against patents. Since the Commission's preparatory documents state "legal certainty" as one of the main objectives for this regulation, and knowing that software developers would like to be free from the current legal uncertainty around patents, we might be able to find a basis for agreement on a solution. If the EU institutions are serious about being fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and if they're serious about standards and interoperability, this could be our chance to get a regulation which ensures that patents never block free software from abiding by standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This regulation will affect a large number of fields, including many fields where innovation is measured in how many patents were obtained this year.  Software risks being collateral damage in a bigger tug-o-war between industrial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Professional's Guide To Haphazardly Picking Licenses For Standards &amp; Specifications</title>
        <subtitle>Practical tips for the reckless licensor</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Standards and specifications straddle the space between software and user-manual–style documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session presents a recent case study of the search for an optimal license for a FOSS specification project. It covers establishing intrinsic goals for the specification itself, documenting interoperability concerns triggered by adjacent standards, and the difficulties posed by adopting or adapting licenses used in other free standards.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Specifications may be descriptive for human readers — like documentation — but may incorporate samples and pseudocode, or snippets that can be quoted within software source files — like a derived software program. For FOSS specifications, striking the ideal balance between permissiveness and fragmentation among implementers poses additional challenges. Though no one-size-fits-all solution exists, this session will compare specification-license strategies and explain how the case-study project resolved its own decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project in question is a specification for OpenType font shaping, but the licensing issues confronted are rather universal. It is a functional specification that attempts to serve as a reference for a variety of software implementations (both FOSS and otherwise) because predictable behavior across vendors is paramount, so there is no one, obvious license to pick for full compatibility. It interacts with prior standards published by other parties, such as Unicode and the multiple owners of OpenType, each of which carries its own license. And it seeks to attract support and buy-in from these outside parties, who may have competing interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the account of the project's search for potential licenses, the session will also look at the paucity of written resources or best-practices discussions dissecting the issues of specification licenses. It will also enumerate and compare the licenses used by other standards-publishers that impact FOSS developers, including the W3C, IEEE, IETF, and Internet Society, and will attempt to categorize the trade-offs made by each of these publishers. It will also discuss how specification licenses differ from other non-software licenses, such as licenses for datasets and general "commons" works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees will come away with a renewed perspective on the questions facing authors of standards and specifications, as well as with up-to-date knowledge of how various specification publishers have described the rights granted and withheld in their licenses and the terms and conditions placed on their consumers. Discussion is encouraged, to distill some pertinent principles primed for practical processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Although the session relates to fonts and text encoding, no prior experience with font internals is required. Attendees should expect, however, to be shown the occasional UTF-8 or UTF-16 codepoint in the slides and be ready to avert their gaze if they feel unprepared.]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;By now you’ve surely heard of Kotlin Multiplatform, and maybe tried it out in a demo. Maybe you’ve even integrated some shared code into a production app. If you have, you know that there are many subtle complications that come up when you want to ship shared Kotlin code. This includes things like modularization, translating between Kotlin and Swift, managing multiple repositories that depend on each other, and optimizing build times and binary sizes. It’s not as easy as it looks when you write your first “Hello World”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Touchlab, we’ve been involved with Kotlin Multiplatform since the very beginning, and we’ve learned a thing or two along the way about what does and doesn’t work well. Come hear about how we’ve solved some of these difficulties to ship Multiplatform code across all sorts of organizations and environments, so you’re ready to use KMP in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reflection is a very powerful JVM feature that allows to create implementations of interfaces on the go, as well as exploring the type hierarchy, methods and properties of a given class.
These capabilities do not exist in Kotlin/Multiplatform, so we will explore an alternative method to runtime reflection: a compile-time symbol processor to create compile time mirrors.
Using Mocking as an excuse (as mocking typically needs reflection), we will explore how we can use KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processor) to circumvent the absence of reflection and generate efficient test mocks at compile time. We will also see the limitations that multiplatform brings to both the KSP generator and its associated runtime, and we will explain the tradeoff that needs to be made when using KSP, and why they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Toward better Kotlin Multiplatform architecture with Dependency Injection and KSP</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dependency Injection has become boring in Kotlin Multiplatform projects. Now compiler plugins can make the use of this pattern exciting again! Kotlin Symbol Processor (KSP) brings the fun back and helps us manage our dependencies with a nice fully typed API. Let's deep dive into it and see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will talk about what makes Compiler plugins useful. How they help us build more reliable applications by reducing boilerplate and generating robust APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we generate code and why can be confusing or misunderstanding. So, we will take Dependency Injection as an excuse for our Kotlin Symbol Processor tour. First of all, we will configure a new processor module. Then we will see how we can create our own Kotlin symbol processor to enhance our architecture by providing a fully typed Dependency Injection API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rust is a fast rising star in the pantheon of programming languages and comes with some interesting properties in regard to Multiplatform. On the other side, Kotlin promises with KMP as well Multiplatform capabilities.
Are both set up to be rivals, or could both complement each other? What could Kotlin learn from Rust, and where might Rust borrow from Kotlin?
The talk will give you an opinionated introduction into KMP with Rust in terms of tooling, developer experience and all the things I discovered so far. It will not sell you a ready to go product, but rather an idea.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will bring you the good word of Multiplatform in terms of Kotlin and Rust. It will on board you to the idea of Multiplatform and what it means in terms of Kotlin and Rust each.
This also means it will explain some keyconcepts which are characterizing for the work with it in regard to your Multiplatform project.
It will show you, how you can use Rust and KMP on iOS, Web and of course Android. Also, it shares some pitfalls, workarounds and other lessons learned from failures with you.
Let’s figure out if this is the beginning of a love story!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is now in Beta, enabling a whole new series of possibilities to share code between platforms. But sometimes things don't go as planned, especially when using an out-of-the-box multiplatform library on a native iOS project. In this session, we'll talk about what we learned from our experience while porting some Android libraries to Multiplatform ones, with a focus on how it's possible to improve the user experience on Swift when consuming Kotlin Multiplatform artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is great language to do modern functional programming, and in my opinion perhaps the best language to do modern mainstream (hardcore) functional programming.
With the power of Kotlin DSLs we can make functional programming idiomatic, simple and elegant. This talk takes us through the different techniques that we can apply in Kotlin to achieve modern, and elegant functional patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Come to see some of the actions the community has done to push Kotlin further, and get inspiration on how to join or lead that movement for higher software quality and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wish SDK X supported Kotlin Multiplatform? Wish it had coroutines and Flows instead of callbacks? With some bug you encounter in the IDE was fixed? Wish that idea you just had makes it to Kotlin? Wish function as a service from cloud provider Y had first-class Kotlin support? Wish scripting in app Z supported Kotlin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, YOU, can join the push to have more and better Kotlin APIs, and better Kotlin tooling, beyond IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? There's no definite answer, but you'll learn stories about how people are leading that push, all for higher software quality, and wider compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know the story of how Kotlin got installed on all GitHub Actions runners?
You'll learn about that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, that will inspire you enough to become an effective ally in the push for more Kotlin worldwide!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year the Client SDK engineering team made the leap into the world of Kotlin Multiplatform.
With one “simple” goal, to unify the Android, iOS and JS SDK.
We take a dive into why the team wanted to make this move, the history of the SDK and multiplatform efforts up until that point and finally how the new SDK was built!
But more importantly, we will talk about some surprising benefits of moving to Kotlin Multiplatform and how this might be the solution for your next multi-platform project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk doesn't require any past knowledge of Kotlin Multiplatform and assumes a basic level of developer understanding. We talk much more in concepts and the real world experience of one engineering team's pains!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;​​Koin is the Kotlin dependency injection framework well known for its ease of use and efficiency. It has been greatly appreciated by the Android community since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a new major version of the framework is released: Koin 3.2. Let’s explore the great new DSL that still continues to simplify our writings, also the new module hierarchy organization capacity, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Koin Annotations project is also getting to its first stable version: 1.0. It’s a great time to see all you can do with these annotations, powered by Google KSP under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Shrinking in the Age of Kotlin</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Kotlin</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Java is now more than 25 years old and throughout the Age of Java there has been many tools for shrinking, optimizing and obfuscating Java bytecode. This was and is especially important for mobile devices, which have certain resource constraints, from the early J2ME devices to today's Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, in the Age of Kotlin, shrinking is more relevant than ever and not just for mobile applications. As well as mobile Android applications, desktop &amp;amp; server applications are also ever growing in size; for example Compose for Desktop typically generates large application packages. JetBrains has recently integrated ProGuard into the Compose for Desktop Gradle plugin to tackle this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what has changed and how does Kotlin affect shrinkers like ProGuard (which is 20 years old and originally created to process Java compiler produced bytecode)? How does ProGuard shrink classes produced by the Kotlin compiler? The Kotlin compiler just produces Java bytecode anyway, so nothing changes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will take a look at ProGuard under the hood and what's required to process Kotlin apps &amp;amp; libraries. In particular, there will be a deep dive into Kotlin metadata and how ProGuard (via the ProGuardCORE library) makes use of JetBrains' kotlinx.metadata library to read &amp;amp; write the metadata.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to setup a live chatbot in 20 minutes, using exclusively Tock (https://doc.tock.ai) - the open conversational AI platform written in/for Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chatbot should implement, at least:
- skills: Kotlin and no-code
- multichannel capabilities
- basic Web frontend
- analytics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus challenge: run the chatbot on a bare laptop, offline.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Data-oriented programming encourages us to model data as (immutable) data, and keep the code that embodies the business logic of how we act on that data separately. This means stepping away from the traditional OO approach. In this talk I will go into what problems this solves, when to apply this pattern and how Kotlin’s data classes, sealed classes and powerful pattern matching can help you with this.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Decathlon has more than 160 frontend products, including 50 dedicated to mobile applications. Due to this context, it is hard to align the user interface across all these projects while respecting the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin is a Design System developed by Decathlon as a product which can be adapted to any context and with multiple technical implementations for Android, iOS and Web. In theory, you can use this Design System in your application and customize it to fit your theme and your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll focus on Vitamin Compose, the design and technical architecture, biases and what are the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While Compose is easy to adopt, not creating legacy code right at the start of such a journey requires extra planning, awareness, and, most importantly, testing. We'll have a look at how we can test pure Compose UIs as well as hybrid ones that have Views and composables too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll learn what the semantics tree is, its relation to the composition, how we can manipulate it in composables using the Semantics modifier, how we can implement composables with testability in mind, and how we can test pure Compose, and hybrid UIs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Delta-like Streaming of (encrypted) OTA Updates for RAUC</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OTA updates should happen frequently and install quickly even with growing OS and application sizes at limited data throughput and limited on-target storage.
Untrusted cloud storage or communication channels also increase the need for encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview of how the RAUC update framework had to overcome some limitations of the early design to address these challenges without
compromising its original goals.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the RAUC update framework was started as an Open Source project to end the era of home-grown shell-script Embedded Linux and IoT system update 'solutions'.
More than seven years later, RAUC has been used in many diverse projects, of which Valve's Steam Deck is probably the most widely known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this talk will be the introduction of the 'verity' update bundle format in RAUC that has not only improved the verification process but has also allowed extending RAUC by built-in HTTP(S) network streaming support, adaptive delta-like updates, and full bundle encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven by the frequent demand to allow decoupling more frequent app or container updates from full A/B OS updates, the talk will give an outlook on recent developments about reconciling this with RAUC's principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Matter and Thread as Connectivity Solution for Embedded</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Matter is the new kid in town when it comes to IoT protocols. As an application
layer protocol based on IPv6 it aims to be the language for IoT devices. With
Thread it supports a low-power wireless protocol which allows sleepy devices
to operate on a coin cell battery for years and still allow end-to-end
connectivity.
This talk will look at the technology in Thread and Matter and its open source
implementations. Topics include mesh capabilities of Thread, the border
router and service discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on my OpenThread FOSDEM talk from last year this shows an extended blueprint
we created for the Oniro project to provide a connectivity solution for embedded
devices running Linux or Zephyr.
The Matter specification, together with an open source SDK, got just released
in October 2022. As Matter is based on IPv6 it can run over a different number
of connectivity solutions. From the start it supports Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Thread.
The later being a low-power wireless protocol for a few years already, but without
to much traction. With Matter support this might change in 2023 and forward.
With border router support in popular devices like Apple Homepod and TV, Google
Nest and Wi-Fi or Eero access points the needed technology infrastructure will
become available in normal households.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth mesh networks enable creation of large scale device networks and can be very useful for a variety of IoT use cases. As the state of open source tools around it needed some love, it was an ideal candidate for developing Rust stack to help developers use it in their solutions. In this session you'll learn about Rust tools available to develop embedded firmware, linux gateways and cloud applications for Bluetooth mesh solutions.
We'll cover asynchronous embedded Rust with "Embassy" and "Drogue device" projects for writing firmwares and how to use them for mesh applications. Next, we'll explore the state of the mesh on Linux with "Bluez" and "Bluer" projects. We'll see how to use Rust and containers to develop mesh gateways. Finally, we'll describe the final piece needed to build end-to-end solutions, "Drogue IoT cloud".
With this we laid down the architecture and tools needed to build usable mesh applications. The session participants will get a good overview of the whole stack needed to build mesh IoT applications. They learn the benefits of Rust for building this kind of software and find good starting points to get going with their projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building embedded systems is complex, especially if they will last. This talk will be a collection of (funny!) cases and stories of errors made in different projects. Examples cover a wide range of situations, for example, not using git at all (or poorly) or optimizing too early. Marta will also show best practices to follow instead and how to convince customers and coworkers actually to follow those practices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk applies to an intermediate audience, but experts could also find a suggestion or two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>WAM: an embedded web runtime history for LG webOS and Automotive Grade Linux</title>
        <subtitle>Introduction and retrospective</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WAM is the web runtime used in LG webOS (both for its products and the Open Source Edition), and has been adopted by Automotive Grade Linux. It is built on top of Chromium web engine and its Ozone Wayland backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will showcase its main features, and talk about its history, from HP/Palm devices, through LG TV and its Raspberry PI Open Source Edition, to end with its adoption in AGL.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WAM, also known as WebAppManager, or Web Application Manager, is a system service providing web runtime capabilities in LG webOS and AGL platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its goals are:
* Performance through reuse of resources among web applications.
* Provide a native-like experience to applications based on the Web Platform standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a central part of LG webOS in all its flavours, including LG webOS Open Source Edition. As such, it provides a great example of how to integrate the web experience in a Linux system, providing graphics integration through Wayland protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a history of web engines. From QtWebKit, to QtWebEngine, to a custom embedding API directly on top of Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also going to be a history of the flexibility of the platform, as it was possible to integrate it not only on webOS, but also in the different releases of Automotive Grade Linux, even after different architecture rewrites. This presentation will highlight the strong points that make WAM specially flexible for integrating in different Linux platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retrospective of the main milestones of WAM in last decade. But also a look into its future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>KUKSA.val Vehicle Abstraction</title>
        <subtitle>In-vehicle access to standardized VSS Vehicle Signals</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will show-case how Eclipse KUKSA project can help to leverage the advantages of a standardized description of vehicle signals. A large challenge for automotive software is the lack of standardization inside a vehicle. The basic data fabric of a vehicle consists of "signals", such as for example the speed of the vehicle or the state of a door. For this kind of data traditionally there was no standardized way how it is represented or transmitted. This makes even seemingly simple end-to-end applications such as "upload mileage to the cloud" very hard and costly in the industry. With the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (https://covesa.github.io/vehicle&lt;em&gt;signal&lt;/em&gt;specification/)  there exist an approach that is currently quickly adopted throughout the industry  addressing this by introducing a domain taxonomy for vehicle signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KUKSA.val is an Open Source solution that helps transforming and serving such standardised signals inside a vehicle computer enabling faster development of reusable cross-fleet in-vehicle software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will show the architectural answer given by the Eclipse KUKSA project to leverage the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification inside a vehicle: We will show how to use KUKSA components to gather and transform the data from lower embedded layers in the vehicle, and  providing them in a secure way to apps and services.  We will take a look the APIs provided in KUKSA and touch upon questions of data security and privacy. This demonstrates  why within the context of the current Software Defined Vehicle Trend, Vehicle Computers are a worthwhile target for OSS solutions. A lot of benefit can be created by adopting standardised solutions for common challenges, laying a solid and cost-effective foundation for all kind of applications and services on top.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>What does it take to run your desktop camera application on your phone</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux desktop camera applications have traditionally been limited to support
USB cameras preventing their usage on mobile Linux platforms with complex
camera systems. With the adoption of Pipewire and libcamera traditional camera
applications are not anymore limited to desktop system but can be re-used for
mobile platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talks presents the implementation of the components that allow a desktop
camera application to run on a mobile system, using a Pinephone Pro running
PostMarketOS as development platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Linux desktop camera applications have historically supported only simple
use cases and are generally limited to the usage of USB cameras. This has
traditionally prevented their adoption on embedded and mobile devices, such as
Linux smartphones, where the camera system requires precise configuration of the
several components that realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing adoption of Pipewire as the system media device manager in
conjunction with its libcamera backend that enables support for complex
cameras, allows the usage of 'traditional' camera application in new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will demo a desktop camera application such as gnome-camera or cheese running
on a PinephonePro with PostMarketOS and presents the architecture and the implementation of the
components that allow a 'desktop' camera application to run on a mobile Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Advanced Camera Support on Allwinner SoCs with Mainline Linux</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present how support for an advanced camera use case was integrated
into the mainline Linux kernel, using the Media and V4L2 APIs. It involves
supporting a sensor using the raw Bayer RGB format, transmission over the
MIPI CSI-2 bus as well as support for the Image Signal Processor (ISP) found on
Allwinner platforms. A specific focus will be set on this ISP, with details
about the features it implements as well as the internal and userspace APIs
that are used to support it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Capturing pixels with a camera involves a number of steps, from the ADC reading
the photosites in the image sensor to the final pixel values that are ready for
encode/display, with various processing and transmission taking place along
the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While simple cases put most of the heavy lifting on the image sensor's side
(through its embedded processor) and use a simple parallel bus for transmission,
advanced cases require more work to be done outside of the sensor. In addition,
modern high-speed transmission buses also bring-in more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>U-Boot as PSCI provider on ARM64</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OS kernel on embedded ARM64 systems requires PSCI interface to bring CPU cores up/down, suspend/resume/reset/power off. U-Boot bootloader provides a PSCI interface and this talk explains it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk consists of five parts -- how the PSCI interface works, where and how OS kernel calls it, how and in which hooks on the bootloader side do those calls land, and how those hooks in U-Boot provide functionality required by OS. Last part is an example of U-Boot configured to provide PSCI interface on contemporary SoC .&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using the U-Boot PSCI interface over other PSCI interface providers is twofold. First, it allows for utilizing the full potential of U-Boot, and especially the SPL preloader, which can then boot OS kernel directly and quickly. Second, removing one software component from the boot stack reduces the Software BoM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Embedded doesn't mean we can't have nice things. As Linux kernel developers we have grown
accustomed to the comfort afforded to us by Kconfig, device trees, the device-driver model,
multi-platform kernel images, the kernel having sane defaults and virtual filesystems giving
us shell-level access to debug and introspect the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can't we have this in the boot environment? We can and you'll see how, welcome to barebox.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What began as a rejected patchset for adding Kconfig to U-Boot has now been a full-fledged
bootloader in its own right for 13 years. barebox is powering millions of devices around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Marco will give a brief overview of barebox from a kernel developer's point of view and
show how easy it is to add support for a new i.MX8M board. The attendees will see barebox in action
and learn how to leverage the VFS for hardware bringup, kernel debugging and booting the system in
production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yosys and nextpnr made FPGA development very attractive for developers that prefer to use open-source tools over proprietary vendor tools. Affordable and well documented boards with ECP5 FPGAs lowered the entry threshold for hobbyists even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael will show how to use LiteX to use these tools to build soft-core RISC-V SoCs that are capable of running Linux and combine them with use-case specific cores to custom FPGA bitstreams.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LiteX provides a framework to build FPGA SoCs including a few examples of SoCs that are capable of running Linux. However, for fully leveraging the capabilities of FPGAs, one would not only reproduce existing designs, but also implement use-case specific cores and add them to the FPGA bitstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael will give an update on Steffen's and his experiences with using the open-source FPGA tools to build FPGA bitstreams. In recent years, they presented how to build the LiteX example SoCs, run Linux on them, and how to make the systems reproducible by using Yocto. This talk will focus on how to add custom cores that are written in Verilog and Migen to the SoC to implement use-case specific features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As an embedded software engineer, I'm used to be at the border between software and hardware.
However, for many years I delegated everything more complex than finding a GPIO number
to a dedicated hardware team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now working as a freelance engineer, I've decided to get over the barrier, to be more independent.
In this talk, I'll share my journey to the hardware world, from simple hardware designing
and routing using free software to more complex design review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a big difference between hardware and software is the required equipment, I will
also go through the equipment I had to buy and how I use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to convey the message that while hardware is a vast world, it is a real
advantage for the software engineer to get familiar with a few basic tools of
our hardware colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Ups and Downs with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on Wayland, Weston and the Yocto Project</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this short tutorial you will learn how to remotely connect to embedded Linux devices running Wayland and Weston using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on GNU/Linux distributions built with the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded. Exact getting started steps will be provided. We will discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of RDP as well as some troubleshooting guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wayland is an open source display server protocol aiming to replace X11 on Linux devices with a modern and secure windowing system. As of today most of the popular desktop Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora,  support Wayland out of the box. Wayland is also widely used on embedded devices and it is supported by hardware running Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), COVESA (previously GENIVI), WebOS, Tizen, postmarketOS, Jolla, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many compositors compatible with Wayland. Weston is a simple reference compositor. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary network protocol with graphical user interface for connecting to other computers developed by Microsoft. It works on Weston with the screen-share.so plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lightning talk will provide the exact steps how to build from scratch core-image-weston, setup RDP and remotely accesss the embedded device using wlfreerdp (for Wayland) or xfreerdp (for X11) from a personal computer with GNU/Linux distribution in the same network. The examples will be based on the long-term support release kirkstone of the Yocto Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is appropriate for anyone interested in remote access to embedded Linux devices. Previous experience is not required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The PolyVent FLOSS Ventilator</title>
        <subtitle>A Free-libre Respiration Ecosystem</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Public Invention is a non-profit that pivoted to human respiration during the pandemic. The PolyVent is a fully free-libre open mechanical ventilator educational platform for teaching and research. It is part of a proposed and partially implemented complete free ecosystem of medical devices for respiration called Freespireco. It runs VentOS free software which can drive any ventilator. These projects represent a burgeoning open source medical device movement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Free-libre open design hardware grows out of free software. Hardware has greater capital costs than software and is much more expensive to deploy. Medical hardware is more expensive still. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 global pandemic showed that the fragility of our global supply chains kill people. Open source medical hardware is a potential solution to this predictable catastrophe. In coming decades, we hope it will be as common as free software is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PolyVent ventilator was started to address a predicted shortfall in human mechanical invasive and non-invasive ventilators in 2020. This never came to pass in the West, for medical reasons, but it was not a panic—it was a reasonable surmise based on limited data at the time. Over 100 teams tried to create open source ventilators; PolyVent is one of the few still active and fully open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PolyVent is completely open and very modular to allow for educational tinkering and graduate-level research. It runs fully open software called VentOS which can drive any electromechanical ventilator based on an extensible hardware driver model. It uses a “super loop” Arduino framework deployed with PlatformIO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with other modules, such as the VentMon monitor which provides a clinical display in a public data lake and the GPAD (General Purpose Alarm Device), it is an educational platform that has been piloted at one University. Although not for clinical use, we hope for-profit firms will create clinical ventilators based on this design. We understand how to assist such firms in obtaining regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hope is that in the next decade, a complete ecosystem of cooperating medical devices, components, data standards, and software, will make safe, reliable, reasonably priced respiratory care available to all people in all nations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Marius has been playing around with VoLTE with Qualcomm Mediatek devices. He has got to the point of being able to make and receive calls and send and receive SMSs on Ubuntu Touch ported devices. It is still very hacky. Without any knowledge of the modem stack it seemed impossibly difficult but now we are getting some insights into how it works it is possible to see how the binary blobs are doing stuff. The way forward was to run Android and capture all the calls made to the drivers. Sailfish have some of it working so their solution provided tools too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fixes so far are very specific, every proprietary system has its own unique way of doing things. It is a horrible standard and no carrier even follows the standard. The modem is a black box with no outputs. To be honest, when it works, we don’t know why it works. It works perfectly well though, so result. He would like to share his results, to discuss with the wider community how we can rolls this out to get more devices supported.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the recent and coming years 2G and 3G are being phased out by network operators especially the . On a lot of Mobile Foss OSes that are Halium based, this means that they will be useless because you can't make calls anymore. It has been extremely difficult to enable VoLTE service due all the proprietary components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VoLTE stands for Voice over LTE, and LTE (Long Term Evolution) is better known as 4G. So essentially, VoLTE amounts to mobile calls over a 4G network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What happens when you buy a solar roof, and you find out that the logging component has a Raspberry Pi MAC address? Perhaps nothing at the beginning, but sooner or later you'll &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to scratch that itch and teach yourself some reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018 my family installed a solar roof at home. It came with a nice component to log and visualize your production and consumption statistics, and I was pretty surprised to see that its MAC address started with B8:27:EB, the OUI of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. During the 2021 Christmas holidays I finally decided to look into the device, a fun experience covering Modbus, radare2, and even PCB reverse engineering; in this presentation I will explain what I learnt and how I replaced the vendor software with a custom Python program and Home Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Recipes for reducing cognitive load</title>
        <subtitle> yet another idiomatic Go talk</subtitle>
        <track>Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Being the maintainer of a fairly active oss project (MetalLB) over the past year, I reviewed a substantial amount of contributions. During this process, I identified a set of recurring idioms and patterns that less experienced contributors keep missing, making the codebase harder to read and to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe what cognitive load is and why it matters, and provide a way to reduce it via a set of quick and easy recipes. Using this set of actionable recipes the audience will be able to drastically improve the quality of their Go code with relatively low effort.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Building a CI pipeline with Dagger in Go</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs pipelines in containers allowing developers to build
and debug pipelines locally and then run them anywhere avoiding vendor lock-in to a particular CI/CD
solution (well...except Dagger).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the portable pipeline concept may not be new, by combining that with the ability to write pipelines
as code (Go, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, CUE supported at the moment) instead of YAML, Dagger revolutionizes how CI/CD
pipelines are built and ran.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Recently the interest in concurrent programming has grown dramatically. Unfortunately, parallel programs do not always have reproducible behavior. Even when they are run with the same inputs, their results can be radically different. In this talk I’ll show how to debug concurrency programs in Go.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll start from showing how you can debug your gorotines using delve and gdb debuggers. Then I’ll try to visualize goroutines using different scenarios, sometimes it helps to better understand how things work. Next part of the topic will be about dumping a goroutine stack trace of your application while it’s running and inspect what each goroutine is doing. And I’ll demonstrate how to debug leaking goroutines by tracing the process of how the scheduler runs goroutines on logical processors which are bound to a physical processor via the operating system thread that is attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus i’ll cover debugging tips on how to find deadlocks and how to avoid race conditions in your application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover all the new features and changes in Delve since the last in-person FOSDEM and then go right into a deep-dive into how Delve enables extremely low-overhead tracing of Go programs using eBPF.
Attendees will learn not only how to use this new feature of Delve, but also how they can leverage eBPF in their own Go programs. I will start by introducing this new feature, showcasing how it can be used, and
then I will take the audience into an in-depth look at how it is implemented under the hood. The talk will feature a code walkthrough and detailed explanation of the technical details that went into making this
feature a reality. I will also talk in depth about the libraries and approaches used to enable Go programs to leverage eBPF, which will empower attendees to implement such a feature in their own applications as
well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is accessible to any level of Go programmer, from novice to advanced. Novice users will get a lot of benefit from learning how to use the tracing feature in Delve to track down problems in their code,
while intermediate to advanced users will get a lot of information from the technical deep dive and will also walk away with the knowledge of how to integrate eBPF programs into their own codebases. The information
in this talk will be practical and immediately applicable to attendees in their day-to-day Go development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Go Even Further Without Wires" is the thrilling part 3 of the "Go Wireless Saga".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In "Go Without Wires", we wrote TinyGo code that runs directly on Bluetooth devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In "Go Further Without Wires", we used TinyGo to connect to WiFi networks, and consequently to the Internet itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we will extend our reach further out into the real world, with TinyGo programs that can connect to Wide Local Networks (WAN) using the long distance radio protocol LoRA/LoRAWAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will include several live demonstrations, including a flying object.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Strings can seem like one of the most innocuous data structures in Go. Yet, they still play a significant role in most ubiquitous types of programs, such as text processors, in-memory key-value stores, DNS resolvers, or codecs. Their burden on the performance of such programs becomes especially pronounced in distributed systems and cloud-native environments, where the number of strings within an instance of the software can reach an order of millions or more. This gives rise to performance issues and bottlenecks, especially with regard to memory consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide answers to these problems, the talk will discuss several string-optimization techniques. To be more accessible for both beginner and intermediate levels, the talk will first state the problem and briefly introduce strings as a data structure, and will explain how strings look internally in Go. The core of the presentation will be dedicated to discussing operations with strings and how these can be optimized based on various techniques, such as string interning and string concatenation. The author will also share his experience and practical examples of open-source programs, where these techniques are being applied.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Go is a very performant language, so, normally you don't need to optimize it at all. But what happen when you need it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is a walk through some techniques and tools that you can use to squeeze that last drops from your functions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to see tools like pprof or go benchmarks, and explore some of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to explore other topis like escape analysis, function inlining or the garbage collector, that all of them can affect the performance of your application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reconciliation Pattern, Control Theory and Cluster API: The Holy Trinity</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will take a deep dive into reconciliation, which is the fundamental principle behind the working of Kubernetes, and see how we leverage Golang constructs to achieve these patterns. We will explore how to extend these patterns to create what are known as operators in Kubernetes, to enhance its functionalities taking Cluster API as our use-case.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The reconciliation pattern is a design pattern that is commonly used in Kubernetes to ensure that the desired state of a system is consistently maintained. It involves continuously monitoring the state of the system and making adjustments as needed to ensure that it remains in compliance with the desired state. Reconciliation is one of the key patterns that emerge from control theory, which is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and analysis of systems that control the behavior of dynamic processes.
Reconcilers are the heart of Kubernetes and Cluster API. The use of reconcilers in Kubernetes enables users to define the desired state of their clusters declaratively, and let Kubernetes handle the details of implementing and maintaining that state. The reconciliation pattern in Go is implemented by using the Kubernetes API to track the state of the cluster, and Go's concurrency features to ensure that the reconciler runs continuously and can make adjustments in real time.
We will take a look into the implementation of these patterns in their nascent form and then their extension in Cluster API by the use of controllers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Go is a pragmatic choice for developing reliable and robust programs, especially in cloud environments. However, with big data demands, the expensive economy and the ecology aspects, every Go developer will inevitably be required to handle efficiency issues in critical parts of their Go applications or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Bartek Płotka, author of "Efficient Go" O'Reilly book and maintainer of open-source Go projects, will walk you through 5 simple steps that will guide you on how to make effective and pragmatic optimizations in your code in a data-driven manner. The audience will learn about essential open-source tools and strategies that allow them to make their code faster or use fewer resources like memory or CPU when needed. There will also be a chance to win free signed copies of the "Efficient Go" book!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Headscale: How we are using integration testing to reimplement Tailscale</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We use Go, containers, and integration testing to reimplement Tailscale’s (https://tailscale.com/) control server, the closed source SaaS product that coordinates their Open Source WireGuard-based client. This talk tells the story of how we managed to build a stable version of the control server that is now starred by almost 10k on Github and has users all over the world through extensive focus on integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tailscale is a modern mesh VPN built on top of Wireguard (https://wireguard.com/). It works like an overlay network between the computers of your networks - using NAT traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tailscale’s core client, Android client, and supporting libraries and software are Open Source. The SaaS control server and client UIs to proprietary OS (macOS, iOS and Windows) areis closed source. Headscale implements this control server and allows self-hosters and open source aficionados to use Tailscale’s clients without having to use a closed source product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will tell the story of how we started reimplementing the control server based on the code from Tailscale’s official client. We went through stages of “man this works surprisingly well” to “how does this even work” after we started to use aggressive integration testing to improve the “correctness” of our implementation. For every test we added, we found tons of issues to fix, and eventually, we got to a stage where we could improve headscale with great confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, integration testing is potentially the most vital part of our development cycle and we both use it to fix “old and broken”, and add “new and shiny”.
We have managed to take what started out as a learning project to understand how Tailscale worked and built it into a healthy open source project and community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"We're going to build a new type of database in Go" – "Are you mad?!" This was the common reaction when back in 2019, we decided to build an open-source vector database in Go. Today, Weaviate's downloads have exceeded 1.5M (at the time of writing), and we're over the moon with how far we've come. But oh boy, they were right; it was crazy indeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I would like to take you on a journey of the less common and crazier parts of Go: You will learn about pure-assembly optimizations, obscure pitfalls, tricks of heap allocations, and memory management in general.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of this talk, you should have at least an intermediate experience level of Go. The talk touches on database internals, but no prior knowledge of inner-database mechanics is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So buckle up. This is going to get nuts!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many people miss event-driven architecture benefits because they believe it is complex and challenging to implement. In this talk, I will show you how my Watermill library can help you to build a basic event-driven application in Go in 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show that building a basic event-driven application is not that scary with the open-source Watermill library (that I'm the author of). As part of this presentation, I will do live coding so you can see that building an event-driven application may be as straightforward as building an HTTP server. I will briefly overview event-driven architecture (EDA) and why it is a valuable tool for building scalable, resilient applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Is Go Object-Oriented? A Case of Public Opinion</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Go</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you are a Gopher, the mention of the term Object-Oriented Programming is likely triggering for you because Object Oriented represents everything that Gophers love to hate, from over-complicated design to unpredictable execution. But could Go be in fact OO? Experienced or new to Go, this talk is aimed to help you understand where Go fits within the realm of programming languages. Ronna will take you on a journey through the history of OO and the choices that were made when designing Go so that you can decide for yourself if Go is or isn't OO.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Join me in this experiment, we'll make some Go programs visually without writing a single line of Go code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming will be a required skill in the future, but for some people can be scary and difficult at first: too many keywords or too many grammar rules. We could lower the entry bar with a visual programming language, like Scratch is being taught at school. Could Go be a good option for this task? In this talk you could learn what can be done, the problems encountered and how to contribute to the future of this new way of programming Go.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the Wikipedia, a visual programming language (VPL) is any programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since macOS 11, macOS has been shipping with a native framework to run virtual machines which is called 'virtualization framework'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick introduction to Apple's virtualization framework, this talk will show how vfkit uses this framework from go with a focus on the bindings between Objective-C and go. These bindings are needed as the virtualization framework only offers Objective-C and Swift APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Rust based Shim-Firmware for confidential container</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will introduce td-shim (https://github.com/confidential-containers/td-shim).
Td-shim is a lightweight Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) virtual firmware (TDVF) for the simplified kernel for TD based confidential container (e.g. Kubernetes).
In order to match the short start-up time and resource consumption overhead of bare-metal containers, runtime architectures for TD-based containers put a strong focus on minimizing boot time. They must also launch the container payload as quickly as possible. Hardware virtualization-based containers typically run on top of simplified and customized Linux kernels to minimize the overall guest boot time. As such, we introduced the td-shim to replace the traditional Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) based TDVF for container use case.
Currently the rust-based td-shim supports multiple hypervisors such as KVM and cloud hypervisor with smaller size and better boot performance. It provides a secure and efficient way of building the cloud native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Project Veraison (VERificAtIon of atteStatiON)</title>
        <subtitle>(Trying to) making sense of chaos</subtitle>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Veraison is an OSS project that aims at sensibly reducing the complexity associated with the verification of attestation evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote attestation is the means by which a computational workload can provide trust metrics about itself as well as the processing environment on which it executes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence produced by an "attester" is typically used by a relying party to ascertain its security posture, and therefore as a building block to establish trust between the parties involved in distributed computations -- especially those that require a high level of security and privacy, such as in Confidential Computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an attestation is pointless if its trustworthiness can't be verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verification is, in fact, the central function the entire remote attestation architecture relies upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attestation verifier sits amid a complex network of trust relationships and processes -- including device manufacturing, software life-cycle, and product certification -- and has to make sense of a vast and messy amount of information in order to give the relying party the simple answer it needs to instruct its authorisation policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides pre-canned software packages addressing different attestation technologies that can be composed into a verification service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce complexity and fragmentation, Veraison embraces standard interfaces as much as possible while at the same time providing enough flexibility to adapt to technology- and deployment-specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veraison has been adopted by the Confidential Computing Consortium in the Linux Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Nydus Image Service for Confidential Containers</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of container images, we need to download all container images from the registry within trusted domains when creating pods. Current solutions have many disadvantages. The pod/container startup time is extremely slow, the pressure on the network and container registry is high, and additional CPU, memory, and disk IO are consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nydus Image Service project aims to reduce container startup time and resource consumption through techniques such as lazy loading and data deduplication, which may help to solve the problems of container image management for confidential containers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>THE BASE - FOSS Confidential Container SDK to ease the development</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Confidential compute is a powerful new paradigm. However yet it is not easy to use and many developers are hampered from enclaiving their applications. We have developed and open-sourced THE BASE, a set of 18 containerized applications by default leveraging Intel SGX technology. THE BASE covers popular open source applications, such as mariadb, mongodb, redis or runtime environments like python, java, go, rust, ruby. With THE BASE project we aim to help developers to enclave their workload without investing to much time. THE BASE is docker, docker swarm and kubernetes compatible, and requires no change to devops or code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll present the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>A Study of Fine-Grain Compartment Interface Vulnerabilities: What, Why, and What We Should Do About Them</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software compartmentalization decomposes applications into lesser-privileged
components that only have access to what they need to do their job. Properly
applied, compartmentalization can limit the impact of many memory safety issues
by containing corruption within the vulnerable component. Use-cases are
plentiful: library sandboxing, protection of SSL keys, sandboxing of
network-facing code, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last decade we have seen the appearance of many new mechanisms that
enable compartmentalization at a relatively low performance cost (Intel PKU,
the upcoming Intel PKS, CHERI hardware capabilities, vmfunc). This generated a
lot of research with a strong focus on compartmentalizing existing software, at
a fine grain (isolating libraries or components), and as automatically as
possible.  The promises are great: the compartmentalization of legacy software,
with a low engineering effort, and at a low performance cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, in this process, the interfaces between compartments are often neglected:
they are hard to reason about and difficult to secure automatically, and
compartmentalizing at finer and finer-grain exacerbates the issue. This is a
major problem, as weak interfaces enable for many attacks well-known in the
confidential computing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present the result of a study on the impact of neglecting
compartment interfaces. I will define and classify compartment interface
vulnerabilities, and present a fuzzer specialized to catch them. Having applied
it to 25 popular applications and 36 possible compartment APIs, revealing 629
interface vulnerabilities, I will present insights into what makes interfaces
vulnerable, and how to make them more resilient when compartmentalizing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Building a secure network of trusted applications on untrusted hosts</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deploying to "the cloud" is incredibly convenient, but that convenience normally comes at a cost.
The host necessarily becomes a major part of the applications trust domain, and a compromised host means a compromised application or a network of thereof.
This prevents several highly-regulated sectors, such as medical or financial, from directly deploying to "the cloud" as opposed to building their own infrastructure.
Solutions to this problem exist, but most require a custom and &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; implementation tied to a particular hardware vendor and SDK.
I will present a hardware-agnostic and cloud provider-agnostic solution to this issue, which, with minimal changes to the implementation, can be used to secure a network of applications and demonstrate strong trust assertions produced by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Gramine Library OS</title>
        <subtitle>Running unmodified Linux applications in Intel SGX enclaves</subtitle>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gramine (formerly called "Graphene") is a lightweight library OS, designed to run a single Linux application in an isolated environment. Currently, Gramine runs on Linux and Intel SGX enclaves on Linux platforms. With Intel SGX support, Gramine can secure a critical application in a hardware-encrypted memory region and protect the application from a malicious system stack with minimal porting effort ("lift and shift" approach).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last FOSDEM 2022 talk Gramine project has done two releases where we continue to enhance Gramine by adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving performance. Few of the features being, enabling CPU and NUMA topology, support more syscalls and adding Vtune profiling support. In addition, we have also enhanced our GSC (Gramine shielded Containers) tool to deploy Docker containers protected by Intel SGX enclaves. This talk will highlight the major enhancements, as well as the current status of the project and its future plans on enclave dynamic memory management support in Gramine.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Confidential Containers uses a generic guest image to simplify the orchestration and validation of Pod VMs. While this has many benefits, it also introduces some subtle security considerations. This talk will describe a class of so-called Evidence Factory attacks where privilege escalation can lead to dangerous misuse of generic attestation evidence. Can these attacks be mitigated while still preserving the benefits of a generic guest image? This talk will dive into the details of how attestation works for Confidential Containers and expose crucial considerations for anyone working with Confidential Computing more generally.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I teach a university class about the history of computing. To explain how early computers worked, I created the Toy CPU emulator - a reduced instruction set computer in the style of the Altair 8800 or IMSAI 8080. In this presentation, I'll explain how I created the Toy, and how to create and enter programs into the Toy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You enter programs into the Toy using "switches and lights" - the Toy simulates LEDs for each counter and instruction, and the accumulator value. We'll create a few simple programs and enter them into the Toy using 8-bit machine language. The Toy CPU is a great way to learn about machine language programming!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>How to best use your own PV-generated power</subtitle>
        <track>Energy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We all need to help decarbonize our world. It's hard to get hold of a PV system or heat pump for your household these days, but the real challenge to home owners is to implement a comprehensive energy management that makes best possible use of their own solar (excess) power.
There's organizational, regulatory and electro-technical challenges and those specific to control, be it with 'autonomously' acting appliances such as EV chargers and heat pumps or 'simple' things like to detect a washing machine's operational state. And what sort and extent of behavioral change will "household operators" accept ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will have a rapid talk about real world issues we have encountered when developing and deploying a Home Energy Management System based on openHAB.
It's covering the most power intensive use cases of a household: EV charging, heat pump and white goods operations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Obstacles to open source in building energy technology   </title>
        <subtitle>An analysis of the German research landscape</subtitle>
        <track>Energy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, we have examined over 180 research projects that develop, refine and use software related to energy in buildings and neighborhoods. These projects originate from Germany and are funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. The aim of this presentation is to give an overview of relevant research fields and related software, missing software building blocks and to talk about the relationship of software developed and used by the projects to open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we give an overview of the different relevant topics (especially simulations and monitoring) and the related software. We further state why there is a need to develop open sourcealterantives for them. Based on this, we state reasons for the existing challenges  for (research) software in the field of building energy technology. We discuss approaches to solutions and provide impulses for relevant software that is currently lacking.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Emissions from buildings are one of the biggest drivers of global climate change. Refurbishment, changes in use and operation, or adapted planning are ways to reduce these emissions. In order to achieve this goal, researchers worldwide are developing numerous ideas and corresponding software. Our analysis of the German landscape shows that even if criteria for open source and open science are met, much of this software is not reused, resulting in parallel developments. In addition to heterogeneity in the infrastructure, there is also a lack of individual building blocks in open-source software chains (e.g. solvers) that are needed to implement use cases. We describe ideas and approaches to close these gaps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>Energy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will give a brief introduction to electric vehicle charging technology, including an overview of the standards and protocols involved.
This will be followed by a deep dive into how you can build your own AC charging station with open hardware, utilizing the EVerest open source software stack.
Concluding the talk, we will present an outlook on how you could assemble a DC charging station with readily available components.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of EVerest is to develop and maintain an open source software stack for EV charging infrastructure. You can think of it as an operating system for EV chargers with implementations of communication protocols, software modules for representations of hardware devices and tools for simulating the charging process.
In this talk you will learn how you can adapt and use EVerest with existing charging station hardware, as well as building your own AC and DC charging stations. We will show you how you can get started by using open hardware designs and schematics in combination with open source software to build a charging station that will reliably charge your electric vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;No one seems to like the "German Eichrecht", esp. not manufacturers and operators of charging infrastructure, yet it provides security and transparency of your charging sessions. This talk will give an introduction to the fundamentals and requirements of the calibration law and explain you why Open Source of the "Chargy Transparency Software" is not only eyecandy, but a fundamental part of the security goals and guarantees for EV drivers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From a software developer's point of view the German calibration law is not so much about measuring energy correctly or invoicing the correct prices, but a first step towards a more modern zero trust architecture for the e-mobility charging infrastructure. This security update is sorely needed, as todays architecture is full of well-known, yet unaddressed bugs and design flaws mainly caused by the very the bad communication of people in distributed systems and across gated communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides solving technical goals, the German Eichrecht also tries to make sure, that the security gurantees also reach the end users and give them all required tools, data and information to verify the correctness of their charging sessions. Therefore for us Open Source is not only a non-functional, nice-to-have marketing feature off the calibration law or just more cost effective way of shared software development, but a fundamental (functional) requirement. Unfortunately the applicability of the calibration law for those end users is still very low. With the upcoming version 2.x of our Chary Transparency Software we not only introduce multi-language support to support the adoption of the German Eichrecht all over Europe, but also present new services like a real public key infrastructure for energy meter public keys and incremental charge transparency records for a "Real-Time Eichrecht".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we are interested in your feedback and future contributions to this Open Source Project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Seapath is a Power grid substation automation solution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Power grid substation automation is moving toward virtualization. In order to facilitate this transition, it is necessary to have a reference design and industrial grade open source real-time platform that can run virtualized automation and protection applications (for the power grid industry and potentially beyond).
That is why RTE, Alliander and Savoir-faire Linux created SEAPATH project under the governance of Linux Foundation Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several solutions already exist, but they cover only part of the needs. That's why the project aims to assemble the right packages with as few specific developments as possible. The effort is put on testing to ensure that all the parts, hardware and software fulfill the needs for critical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be about the platform itself with virtualization, high availability and cybersecurity features, and also about the test process based on the IEC61850 standard that will validate that the platform can indeed host automation and protection applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Desktop and server software at the present moment in time is very rarely developed with its energy consumption as a major consideration. However in a world with limited resources this becomes a growing concern, especially as developers cannot cater to this need since the appropriate tools are currently lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green Metrics Tool is an open source framework that allows for measuring, comparing and optimizing the energy consumption of arbitrary software. The goal is to empower both software engineers and users to make educated decisions about libraries, code-snippets and software in order to save energy and thus carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any application will be containerized and then analyzed by its logical parts. The open source tool measures classical performance metrics as well as energy related metrics like wattage, temperature and cooling efficiency to understand what part of the software is responsible for which part of the energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the concept of usage scenarios we create an interface for developers to test/develop against. In the end this makes complex software products comparable to each other and thus enables developers to select libraries based on their functionality-energy-profile (for instance messages per Watt or similar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present the roadmap for this tool over the next year, which will result in a public and open database of energy information for arbitrary hardware setups, code blocks and libraries and a green standard library / green code completion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Carbon Intensity Aware Scheduling in Kubernetes</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Energy</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Currently, the energy consumption metrics are only available at node levels. There is no way to obtain container-level energy consumption. Autoscalers and schedulers really need pod-level metrics data in order to obtain energy savings from resizing or migrating containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation introduces Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler) and its integration with Kubernetes. By leveraging eBPF programs, Kepler probes per container energy consumption related system counters and exports them as metrics. These metrics help end users observe their containers’ energy consumption and allow cluster admins to make intelligent decisions on achieving energy conservation goals. The presentation shows that Kepler can be easily integrated into Prometheus and render time series metrics into Grafana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, we will demonstrate sustainable management of clusters by leveraging Cloud-native patterns, Observability and Kubernetes features like node selector, node labels, node name, affinity and anti-affinity to achieve carbon intensity aware placement of workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FIM (Fbi IMproved) is a powerful image viewer with a minimalistic interface. FIM follows the spirit of the VIM (Vi IMproved) text editor: it is specialized in its task and powered by an own domain-specific language (DSL) which allows powerful custom features. FIM happens to be mostly appreciated by users of: [neo]mutt, emacs/mu4e, vim, command-line-interface and non-standard Linux Framebuffer-enabled hardware. The talk will introduce FIM's unique features from the perspective of its DSL, with word on the future. Feedback is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Pre-Scheme is a statically typed dialect of Scheme which offers the
efficiency and low-level machine access of C while retaining many of the
desirable features of Scheme.  Developed by Richard Kelsey in the late
'80s based on the powerful "Transformational Compiler" from his
dissertation, it didn't see much use beyond the Scheme 48 virtual
machine.  With a renewed community interest in systems-level Scheme
programming thanks to the growth of the Guix project, it's high time we
revisit this corner of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will:
- review the history of Pre-Scheme
- review its compiler implementation and related work
- discuss the features &amp;amp; limitations of Pre-Scheme
- discuss porting efforts &amp;amp; future work&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Bringing RISC-V to Guix's bootstrap</title>
        <subtitle>What's done and what we need to do</subtitle>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk is a review of my work on Guix's bootstrapping process for RISC-V. The presentation describes why we needed to make this, the challenges I encountered, what I focused doing, what is missing and how people can take part.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The bootstrapping process starts with Stage0-POSIX, then comes Gnu Mes and from there a bootstrappable fork of TinyCC is built. From that point, GCC is somehow built and then the rest of the distribution is built using it. In this talk, we'll discuss the last part of this process, from the bootstrappable TinyCC to the final GCC that compiles the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NlNet's support, I spent some time this last year preparing this process to be ready for RISC-V. During the talk I'll share the work that has been done, I'll introduce some of the particularities that RISC-V has, why this process has been different to the other architectures and I'll describe the current state of the bootstrapping process and how it can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using GNU Guix Containers with FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) Support</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Declarative and Minimalistic Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The GNU Guix package manager/distribution provides its own containers as part of a more general tool, 'guix shell' for quick one-off or repeatable environments. The container option is isolated from the host system, with options to expose directories, network interfaces, and so on. This is an excellent tool for isolating software in a completely controlled and reproducible environment in a minimal way. Recently, we added an option to emulate the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) within the container, so that this environment looks like a more "typical" distribution with a global '/lib', '/bin', etc., unlike a Guix system. This is helpful for developing or running software which expects or assumes an FHS file layout. For example, many language environments want to manage their own tools and download binaries, or some software isn't yet packagable for Guix, like a fully source and bootstrapable JavaScript application. These would otherwise be very difficult to use in Guix and now we can do so in an (isolated) environment. This talk will introduce 'guix shell' and the container and emulate-FHS options with examples of real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix functions well as a package manager and has been extended to also serve as a full operating system, under the name Guix System. In this talk I will show how it is possible to declaratively create operating system images for specific uses. Different than a 'spin' of a distribution, these can be used as a one-off live image or as a starting image to install to a computer before making further tweaks. Create your own minimal rescue image without needing to remaster media or use loopback mounts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jon Doyle's 1978 PhD thesis proposal, 'Reflexive Interpreters,' describes the idea of a reflective problem-solving meta-interpreter with a sophisticated model of its own behavior, semantics, capabilities, and limitations, that would display "self-conscious" behavior.  We investigate this idea of a reflexive interpreter, and connect it to ideas from McCarthy, Minsky, and Lenat.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) has facilitated the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”). To achieve this, the SSI has engaged a community of researchers; Research Software Engineers and developers; instructors and trainers that deliver research software training; research policymakers; and groups that provide services that support research software development. We will present an overview of the Institute’s main activities to engage the research software community, such as the Fellowship Programme, annual Collaborations Workshop, and Research Software Camps, and how you can get involved. We will also talk about resources that we have made available (e.g. the SSI Event Organisation Guide and other templates) that people are free to adapt and use to ease their own organisation of activities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Expected prior knowledge / intended audience: No prior knowledge is required for this talk. The intended audience includes all developers and users of open tools and technologies used in a research/investigation context who are interested in joining and collaborating within an inspiring and supportive research software community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association started as a project in Cohort 4 of the Open Life Science Programme in the year 2021. Since its launch, the RSE Asia Association has been deeply influenced by the Open Science principles. In this talk, we highlight how the Open Life Science programme helped us shape the RSE Asia Association and the benefits we derived by building a community based on Open Science principles. We will also highlight the journey and future plans of the RSE Asia Association.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest obstacles to implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research practices,  is the lack of awareness about what solutions are available across disciplines. Furthermore, most of the discussions around FAIR, Open and Good Data practices, as well as the solutions and requirements, occur at a higher level, distanced from the researchers who are the ultimate end-users of the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, we launched FAIRPoints-an event series highlighting pragmatic measures developed by the wider research community towards the implementation of the FAIR data principles https://www.fairpoints.org/.&lt;br/&gt;
Our goal is to bring together; the research community- the ultimate user and producer of data, policy and decision makers- shapers of research practices, and the broader research support populace- to aid in the development of solutions for better Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse by providing a platform for conversations to take place around realistic and pragmatic FAIR implementations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will present some of the ongoing projects and community efforts driven by FAIRPoints.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a new data management IDE for CSV that provides functionality to describe, extract, validate, and transform tabular data. It's a logical continuation of the Frictionless Data project's standards and software with a focus on the non-technical audience: data publishers, librarians, and, in general, people who prefer visual interfaces over command-line interfaces and programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Managing efficiently references for research papers or general works is of paramount importance for scholars and students across the spectrum. The common tasks of such a user range from information retrieval of a publication to easy tagging and searching the user's own library. Several libre and proprietary software packages exist. The package Papis consists of an extendable Python library, a flexible command-line interface and a simple (but powerful) data model. This in turn, empowers the user to curate her library metadata in a future-proof and privacy-respecting manner. Papis users are encouraged and empowered by a clear API to write scripts and libraries to extend the core functionality. All major text editors have an interface to Papis and a web-application for remote access to the user's libraries is also in place.  Additionally, during the last 7 years we have built a vibrant community of academic and industry researchers that have become happy users and avid contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With roughly 20 billion monthly pageviews, 15 million monthly edits, and almost 55 million articles across 300+ languages, Wikipedia and its sister projects are an essential part of the free Knowledge ecosystem. These projects are created and maintained by a vast network of volunteers.
The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization operating Wikipedia, has a Research team of scientists, engineers, and community developers. They use data and scientific methods to support the needs and advance the understanding of the Wikimedia projects, their readers and their contributors. To expand the team's  capacity and breadth of expertise, a focus area of the team is to improve the social and technical infrastructure  that helps the broader Wikimedia Movement and research community to tackle complex research challenges.
In this talk, members of the Wikimedia Foundation’s Research team will give an overview of their recent efforts to support the community of researchers working on Wikimedia projects. Specifically, they will discuss i) the generation of open data resources; ii) tools for working with open Wikimedia data; and iii) building and releasing machine-learning models to support Wikimedia projects. The goal of this talk is to demonstrate to open tool developers and researchers how to leverage these resources and contribute to the Wikimedia Research community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;vhost-user-blk is a userspace block I/O interface that has traditionally been used to connect software-defined storage to hypervisors. This talk covers how any application that needs fast userspace block I/O can use vhost-user-blk and its advantages over network protocols. A client library called libblkio is available for C and Rust applications will be introduced. The protocol is also summarized for those wishing to understand how it works or implement it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended for developers interested in connecting applications to SPDK or qemu-storage-daemon and those who want to know more about software-defined storage interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local block storage interfaces

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel vs userspace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications vs polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message-passing vs zero-copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is vhost-user-blk?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented by qemu-storage-daemon and SPDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;virtio-blk and VIRTIO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to connect using libblkio (C/Rust)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to implement a server using libvhost-user (C) or vhost-user-backend (Rust)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to integrate with the Linux kernel block layer using VDUSE&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>CANCELLED Container Storage Interface Addons</title>
        <subtitle>Extending CSI specification to provide advanced storage operations</subtitle>
        <track>Software Defined Storage</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was cancelled.
The aim of this session is to discuss about Container Storage Interface (CSI), its specification and
details on additional advanced operations provided by CSI-Addons.
CSI specification defines an interface along with the minimum operational and packaging recommendations for a storage provider (SP) to implement a CSI compatible plugin. The interface declares the APIs that a plugin MUST expose: this is the primary focus of the CSI specification.
The CSI-Addons project hosts extensions to the CSI specification to provide advanced storage operations. By adding new procedures to the CSI-Addons Specification, additional operations for storage systems can be provided. The reference implementation is done on Kubernetes, and maintained in the Kubernetes CSI-Addons repository. Some of the advanced storage operations that are currently supported are reclaim space, network fence, volume replication and encryption key rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation will cover the following outline:
1. Introduction to Container Storage Interface  (CSI)
   - The Container Storage Interface (CSI) aims to enable Storage Providers to write one CSI compliant Plugin that “just works” across all Container Orchestrators (CO) that implement CSI.
2. Architecture &amp;amp; Terminologies
  - The primary focus of CSI specification is on the protocol between a CO and a Plugin. It SHOULD be possible to ship cross-CO compatible Plugins for a variety of deployment architectures. In this section, we will be discussing in-depth, the architecture of CSI-Specification and related terminologies.
3. All about CSI-Addons
  - The CSI-Addons project hosts extensions to the CSI specification that provide advanced storage operations. We will be discussing various aspects of the CSI-addons project further in our talk.
4. Working and Demonstration of Advanced storage operations provided by CSI-Addons:
   i. Reclaim Space: The Reclaim Space specification defines an extension to the CSI Specification that will enable Storage Providers (SP) to develop controllers/plugins that can free unused storage allocations from existing volumes.
   ii. Network Fence: The Network Fencing specification provides a mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to network-fence any client using corresponding CIDR (Classes Inter-Domain Routing) blocks.
   iii. Volume Replication: The Volume Replication specification provides a mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to support async-replication which can be used for disaster recovery operations.
   iv. Encryption key rotation: The Encryption Key Rotation specification provides a mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to rotate keys for encrypted volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk has been cancelled. The speaker is no longer able to attend FOSDEM.
The objective of the talk is to highlight the various aspects and importance of two of the pillars of Observability: Metrics &amp;amp; Logs in Ceph Storage cluster. We will talk about the current architecture of metrics collection and logging, technology stack used and how you can easily deploy them in Ceph.
This talk will also highlight the various aspects and importance of Centralized Logging, which can be very useful to view and manage the logs in a Dashboard view.
We will also have a demo at the end where we'll show deployment of monitoring and logging services from Ceph dashboard
Demos:
Monitoring demo:
Diagram showing metrics collection architecture
Deployment of monitoring stack (ceph-exporter, Prometheus, Grafana)
Prometheus targets and query page
Grafana dashboards embedded in Ceph dashboard
Centralized logging:
Diagram showing centralized logging architecture
Deployment of log collector an aggregation services (Promtail &amp;amp; Loki)
Pattern based filtering in Loki&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda: Introduction to Monitoring and Centralized logging Dashboard in Ceph storage cluster and Demo&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The transition to a more sustainable future requires not only technological innovation, but also new opportunities for society to participate in the development and adoption of technologies. Open source culture has demonstrated how transparent and collaborative innovation can support modern digital services, data and infrastructure. Open Source Software (OSS) accelerates the transition to a sustainable economy by supporting traceable decision-making, building capacity for localisation and customisation of climate technologies, and most importantly, helping to prevent greenwashing. Despite the transformative impact of open source culture, its potential for developing environmentally sustainable technologies is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first analysis of the open source software ecosystem in the field of sustainability and climate technology. Thousands of actively developed open source projects and organizations were collected and systematically analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods as part of the Open Sustainable Technology project. The analysis covers multiple dimensions – including the technical, the social, and the organisational. It highlights key risks and challenges for users, developers, and decision-makers as well as opportunities for more systemic collaboration. Based on these unique insights, we were also able to define the Open Sustainability Principles that embody open source in sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Making the world a better place through Open Source</title>
        <subtitle>Focusing the unique power of Open Source Communities as force of social good in today's complex geopolitical landscape</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - Janson</track>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a world characterized by an increasingly complex geopolitical climate, war and with vital challenges like climate change begging for immediate and substantial action, the open source community has a unique role to play and has a vital chance to deliver solutions for these long standing issues at a pace and effectiveness that no single individual or public or private entity could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we will explore how contributors, maintainers, public and private sector are, should come together through the positive-sum game that open source is to impact not only the future of technology but drive impactful outcomes is some of the most pressing global social challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If software is eating the world, then, by all metrics, Open Source is eating software. That means that collaborations and innovation that happen every day in the open source community don't only have a major impact on technology but, as every industry and nation states undergo the "digital transformation", have a unique potential to make a lasting impact in our daily lives and offer novel solutions to long standing issues like climate change, incurable illnesses, financial inclusion and food scarcity, as well as bridge historical geopolitical rifts to continue to deepen in an increasingly divided world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will provide an overview of existing open source projects which are making already a huge impact on fundamental areas like Energy and Climate, Public Healthcare, Agricultural innovation and financial inclusion, as well as hone in on areas where open source collaboration can build bridges across historically divided, if not hostile, regions and states by putting forward a model for a positive sum-game that all actors in the open source community, from individuals to the private and public sector, can benefit from, while delivering immense collective value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers and especially open source contributors have a unique power in their hands if we collectively are able to harness it towards higher and higher order challenges: this talk will be an open letter and call to action to everyone, with a particular focus on policy makers and governments around the world, to focus our efforts towards making the world a better place through open collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The open source community has become vulnerable to new kinds of attacks on the software supply chain and there have been efforts by many to address those challenges. Those efforts require new processes, new tools, and new initiatives to drive adoption. Heightened interest, particularly by governments of the world, has driven the open source community to respond with a mobilization plan to achieve specific goals. The Linux Foundation and OpenSSF delivered a first-of-its-kind plan to broadly address open source and software supply chain security outlining approximately $150M of funding over two years to rapidly advance well-vetted solutions to the ten major problems facing open source software security. These concrete action steps are designed to produce immediate improvements and build strong foundations for a more secure future. Find out what you can do to be more secure and support this global security effort.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Rosegarden: A Slumbering Giant</title>
        <subtitle>How a 20-year old OSS project is still going strong</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rosegarden is an open-source Linux MIDI, Audio sequencer and Notation editor, originally created for a university project in 1992 and is still going strong over 30 years later. The current incarnation of Rosegarden for Linux was kick-started in 2001 by Chris Cannam, Guillaume Laurent and Richard Bown. In this talk, one of the original creators of this legendary piece of OSS history takes you through the project's history and analyses some of the critical elements for its continued success to this day.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 'current' version of Rosegarden was actually a complete bottom-up rewrite that started in 2001. The previous incarnation (Rosegarden 2.1) was initially written for IRIX and then ported to other UNIX variants, including in 1995, Linux. The current version has not significantly changed since its original architecture was settled in 2001-2004. What's so good about it that keeps it working to this day? How many people are working on it now? And what do current users think of the project and where is it going next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Richard for an entertaining and exciting ride through Linux audio history as well as the history and architecture of Rosegarden.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Podcasting has been around for 20 years.
Many revolutions have happened since then: DSL connections, smartphones, social networks, artificial intelligence everywhere… But Podcasting stayed still and its decentralized architecture resisted to the big corporations.
In this talk we will show how the Podcasting 2.0 community is reinventing Podcasting by adding tons of new features, while keeping all this interoperable.
We will quickly demonstrate how this actually works with Castopod, an open-source podcast hosting solution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In November of 2022 over 30,000 Twitter users decided to create an account on my Mastodon server running in my basement. By the end of the month I had scheduled time off my job as a Principal engineer at GitHub and began the process of legalizing an entity to protect the service. The rack of hardware began to topple over due to the increase in load, and I found myself instantly responsible for 30,000 passwords, email addresses, IP addresses, and access to several extremely popular technologists personal direct messages. This is the overview, research, hypothesis and outcomes that came from the mass exodus of Twitter. Learn how I was able to form a cooperative entity to combat the impact of ruthless capitalism in Silicon Valley in the name of a sustainable free and open source social media service.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Running a Hybrid Event with Open Source</title>
        <subtitle>The Plumbers Experience</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - Janson</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the pandemic years, conference organizers have had a crash course in running online events, but now that the world is returning to normality, they're under pressure to keep the on-line portion of the conference for a hybrid remote/local event.  Linux Plumbers Conference is a usually in-person event that specializes in direct in-person interactions as well as more traditional presentations.  This year was the first time we tried to take our on-line infrastructure and repurpose it for hybrid in Dublin in September.  One of the big factors in running a hybrid conference is that it's no longer just the committee and a server farm, you have a venue, a local audio team, an external A/V handler and the technology all to plumb into a seamless experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plumbers online was based on BigBlue Button and Matrix, which is what we also used for hybrid.  This presentation will be the story of how it was put together, how the in-person and local components were designed to interact, how it worked in the field and, although plumbers received universal acclaim for being one of the most successful hybrid conferences, the many things that went wrong during the conference and how we surmounted, or at least worked around, them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our technology infrastructure was set up identically to virtual: BigBlue Button (BBB) handling the audio/video but with the in BBB chat element replaced by matrix.  The reason we have an external A/V company in the mix above is because we've always done streaming from the in-person conference, and this was planned to be our free tier of the conference; view the stream and be able to interact with the room chat over matrix.  We've discussed before [1] the scaling problems of this setup (and so won't go over scaling in this presentation), but we'd fixed this in virtual and had no scaling issues in hybrid.  Of great importance to getting the interaction to function was audience training.  We used the same methodology for virtual (essentially only unmute your video if you want to interject) and hybrid, so we already had the on-line training ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the on=site issues were caused by the steep learning curve the external A/V company had to go through to manage the room BBB console as well as getting the in room sound setup correct (onsite audio isn't used to having a remote feed, but they can be persuaded to treat it like an audio feed from the presenter).  Our biggest problem actually turned out to be the size of our onsite committee tech team (2 people) which was insufficient to the number of live rooms (six) we were running.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Matrix 2.0</title>
        <subtitle>How we’re making Matrix go voom</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - Janson</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Matrix is an open standard for secure, decentralised communication, which may be familiar from powering the online editions of FOSDEM in 2021 and 2022 (and hybrid-FOSDEM this year!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will explain the fundamental changes which are landing in Matrix 2.0, which speeds up Matrix to be at least as snappy as the fastest proprietary messaging apps - all while handling thousands of rooms spanning millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During 2022 we've been on a mission to completely rework the slowest bits of Matrix, aiming that nobody can ever complain about Matrix being sluggish again. In practice this means fundamental changes in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how Matrix syncs data - "sliding sync", where servers only sync the bare minimum data to clients required to render the UI, providing instant login and instant sync (MSC3575)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how room joins work over federation - "faster joins", where servers only sync the bare minimum data such that clients can start participating in the room as soon as possible  (MSC3902)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how auth works - switching Matrix to use OIDC natively for all authentication, registration and account management (MSC3861)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how VoIP works - switching Matrix to natively support multiparty decentralised E2EE VoIP as the primary calling mechanism (MSC3401 and MSC3898)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The end result is transformational, and by far the biggest change to Matrix since the project began in 2014. So, we're calling it Matrix 2.0, and this talk will give a guided tour of everything that's changed - and show off the new reference matrix-rust-sdk client SDK, which powers the new flagship mobile Matrix client, codenamed Element X.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software has been a common thread across all of  NASA's major achievements from the Moon landing to the deepest images of our Universe. Today, NASA relies on, releases, and contributes to Open Source Software to advance its scientific missions.  From powering our databases monitoring our planet and Sun to running in our missions on other planets, Open Source Software is critical to addressing NASA's biggest challenges on climate change, exploring the solar system, and discovering life beyond Earth. The Ingenuity helicopter, exploring the surface of Mars, is guided by Open Source Software. The amazing images of the earliest galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope were made possible by open source software developed openly and contributed back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, NASA is taking the next steps to further broaden the impact of open source by applying it to the scientific process with its Open Source Science Initiative. NASA is directly supporting open source scientific software through grants and contributions. To further advance scientific reproducibility and reuse, the scientific software underlying future scientific results will be made openly available and unrestricted mission software will be developed openly to allow for community contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't know about ls, chmod or cp? Who isn't using it daily?
Coreutils are critical components of any Unix. According to its Wikipedia page, the first versions of cp or chown have been released in November 1971.
Almost all Linux distros are based on the GNU implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward today, a community spawned to reimplement the coreutils in Rust. We are able to boot a Debian with it, build Firefox or LLVM, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will explain why we are re-implementing the wheel.
But also how we are doing it, share some of the corner cases we have been facing, why we are (sometime) faster, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also quickly mention the usage of Rust in the Linux kernel.
With these two projects, we think that we will see more and more core piece of the Linux ecosystem in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Zero Knowledge Cryptography and Anonymous Engineering</title>
        <subtitle>The development of zk-snarks in recent years and explosion in algos has opened up an entire new design space of anonymous engineering.</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cryptography is undergoing a renaissance and explosion in algorithms that open up entirely new design spaces. Techniques such as zero-knowledge snarks, multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption allow us to create software that just 5 years ago was unimaginable. This unlocks a new field that we term anonymous engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will briefly explain how they work from a high level mathematical overview, present the abstraction they provide and show how they can be composed into applications. We will also show demos of writing ZK proofs and deploying them in our software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The original designers of UNIX in the 80s had a vision of computing which would allow groups of people to collaborate. From that vision was born the modern conceptualisations of networking, multi-user accounts, filesystems and multi-process OS. But they were limited at the time by the computer resources available, the network bandwidth and the algorithms. Since then the paradigm of computing has remained largely stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the Linux world after many setbacks is doing soulsearching and trying to understand what made us truly unique, getting back to first principles and our original values. We believe the time is ripe for the grand mission of reinventing the paradigm of computing. Recent developments in p2p &amp;amp; consensus algorithms, and crypto algorithms in particular ZK lay the groundwork for us to extend the original vision of the UNIX creators much further. Our wish is to draw the attention of the free software community to these magical and important developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, we want to also present the software stack that we are creating. Our team at DarkFi has created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous DAO (treasury management where participants have voting rights)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted task manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous chat software with spam protection (no registration, uses ZK proofs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this software is p2p and censorship resistant. We will explain other potential software designs such as authentication of information, anonymous auctions, proof of reserves, private statistical processing of info, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you have a project or a business, how are you measuring growth, adoption, and success?   Many companies need help understanding how open source community success translates into commercial success ( or a sustainable business ).  The conversion from free open source users to paying customers is a challenging one, but there are some common techniques and practices successful companies deploy.   For example:  Optimizing your user journey is critical and can make or break your success.  Did you know, for instance, some of the best companies can convert users browsing their documentation to those downloading their software at a 5:1 ratio, while others convert at a 500:1 ratio.   How do you optimize your journey to enable people to not only easily download your software but use it?   During this talk, I will outline the best practices, metrics, and processes you should follow when looking to build or grow your business.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Starting an Open Source Startup</title>
        <subtitle>What you need to know before starting your own open source startup</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Starting your own startup can be both very similar and very different to starting your own business, or even starting an open source project. It provides you the opportunity to be your own boss and control your destiny, while working on something that you are passionate about that can make a positive impact on the world. A startup, however, is different in that it's expected to grow rapidly and reach a high level of revenue, often raising money from investors to expedite this growth. There are many ways to start successful businesses, and a rapid growth startup is only one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source startups are great for the open source community, and we will all benefit from having more of them started. They bring in more contributors, and enable more people to work on open source software full time, making for more quality open source software. Successful open source startups also tend to contribute to upstream projects, both financially and with code contributions, making the whole ecosystem better. While there is a lot of information online about starting your own startup, there is much less information about starting open source ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk Tom will talk about why you should or should not start an open source startup, and what you need to consider when building an open source startup, covering topics such as fundraising, business model, product, and more. Tom will draw examples from his experience building two successful open source businesses, one of which has raised over $10m in venture capital, and the experiences of fellow founders of other successful open source startups.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The general consensus is that is too hard or too expensive to run a small business on entirely free software. After running my company for 5 years on entirely free software I think this is not the case. We have instant communication, shared calendars, groupware, single sign on, and a single administration interface! Things have worked out really well and in many ways are better integrated than trying to combine multiple different cloud based services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will walk through how our infrastructure works, what the pitfalls were, and what the benefits are. At the end I'll give a short demo on a couple of virtual machines to show off the user and admin experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The End of Free Software</title>
        <subtitle>How the Cloud threatens FOSS and what we can do about it</subtitle>
        <track>Main Track - K Building</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free and Open Source Software “won”–it successfully democratized access to code and technology—but the industry changed. Cloud computing has created an always online, software-defined world orchestrated around running software-as-a-service. This reintroduced practical limits to software freedom as hyperscalers create proprietary differentiation through secretive operation and management software. In practice, we have become dependent on proprietary services built on a FOSS foundation. This proprietary capture threatens to undermine the very ability to create Free and Open Source Software. This presentation explores suggestions (such as the Operate First initiative) for how FOSS can, and must, evolve to face these challenges and democratize the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Free and Open Source Software has successfully democratized access to code and technology. FOSS has become  the common, universal base for software development. However, despite “winning” the industry, FOSS largely stops with 'software at rest' (the runtimes, toolchains, and code components used when running your environment and building your applications). Upstream projects can take these software components and run them, but putting them into production at scale is mostly protected as proprietary knowledge by the companies offering cloud services on top of FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; FOSS enabled the evolution of computing through cloud and microservices, as well as the increasing ubiquity of software control in the physical world. With this widespread adoption the challenges to FOSS have changed: the software industry has remade development into the aggregation of black-box services running on infrastructure controlled by a third party. It has, in essence, re-created the problem of the mainframe. To survive, FOSS must evolve through open sourcing operations. Operate First is one way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During Covid a lot of public and private services switched to – in most of the cases -closed source or commercial services online solutions to book appointments and meetings. At, GFOSS, we adapted EASY!Appointments, an online open source platform for appointment
management and Jitsi, an online open source meeting with audio/ video and combined them into to a seamless integration for booking an appointment that will take place online rather than physically.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While a lot of open source projects should be praised for their commitment to openness, the topic of infrastructure is usually taboo, as many times it ends up that it’s in the hands of Big Tech companies/GAFAM. While the reasoning why small and medium teams do not move away from big (evil) tech platforms can sometimes be convenience, there can be monsters lurking in the shadows. In this presentation we will explore and celebrate the movement of independent, self-governed open source infrastructure providers, recognize some of the challenges in the path of libre infrastructure, and share how to migrate from tech oligopolies to open source cloud platforms without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Follow this short presentation if you are wondering why many projects that are working on open source software, open data, online privacy and open knowledge and not only, do not use Free Libre Open Source Software for their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Grottocenter is an open source database for cavers. It contains information about caves that can be used to prepare a caving trip but also background information that can be useful to learn more about the geology in a specific region. All information is submitted by contributors just like Wikipedia. Grottocenter is developed by a team of volunteers who are being supported by the Wikicaves Foundation. Funding comes from several caving organisations and donations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What can engineers do for digital humanities? What are the issues that our open source community can solve in this context?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will report two years experience in helping researchers in humanities (philosophers, literary scholary, archivists...) in approaching their problems.
At the end the audience will get an overview of some tools and methods used by the DH community. This will be the opportunity to observe the differences that the open source software community vs the Humanists are facing and reflect on how we can find a common ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is presented by the center of Digital Humanities of Uppsala University (CDHU).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;France has nearly a million teachers. Among them, there are teachers developing Open Source softwares but there are also more and more teachers using markdown + mkdocs + pages to create and share educational content.
Yesterday all these projects were scattered over multiple forges including Microsoft's GitHub which is difficult to trust in the long term.
With the support of the French Ministry of Education, the "Forge of Digital Educational Commons" project aims to pool all these projects on a dedicated GitLab instance and invite the school community to participate.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FOSSbot is a 3D-printed educational robot that uses open software, open design and electronics, and can be employed in all levels of education. FOSSBot has been developed collaboratively by Harokopio University of Athens and the Greek Free and Open Source Software (GFOSS) community. The use of FOSSBOT in education will be supported by collaborative seminars for all teachers of all specialties and levels based on educational material developed at https://elearn.ellak.gr. The aim of the action is to familiarize teachers with modern education models based on the S.T.E.A.M approach. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) and establish a student-centered approach to knowledge, based on open technologies, in order to lay the foundations for the creation of an open environment of discovery learning that will creatively contribute to the transformation of students into active citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOSSBot belongs to the DIY (Do It Yourself) category, with the logic that it can easily be built by other people besides its creators, and its disassembly and reassembly process can be part of an educational process in the classroom. This is possible since FOSSBot is made of electronic materials that can be easily found commercially at a low cost while the plastic parts are printable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information and the sources can be found at:

        <description>&lt;p&gt;FOSSbot is a free and open source and open design 3D printed robot that can be used in education. It belongs to the DIY (Do It Yourself) category, with the logic that it can easily be built by other people besides its creators, and its disassembly and reassembly process can be part of an educational process in the classroom. This is possible since FOSSBot is made of electronic materials that can be easily found commercially at a low cost while the plastic parts are printable.
It provides four main operation modes: i) a UI with buttons that is suitable for preschool children and shows the main capabilities of the robot, for example moving the robot forward or backward, or turning clockwise and anti-clockwise, ii) a block-based graphical programming interface (based on Google Blockly) aimed at primary school students, iii) a notebook coding interface that can be used for teaching high school students and elementary school students the fundamentals of Python programming (such as loops, conditions, events, etc.), iv) a Python coding mode, which allows to directly work into the FOSSBot programming shell and gives direct control to the low-level electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software of FOSSbot is based on a modular stack that allows the implementation the various programming functions, orchestrates everything through the UI, and controls the hardware in an easy way through a software library that plays the role of the FOSSBot operating system. This stack includes Google Blockly, Python Jupyter, Python Flask which hosts FOSSBot's UI, the core FOSSBot library written in Python which controls the bot's hardware, and finally the manual operation it offers to users through a user interface, i.e. a way to control the robot without any programming knowledge.
FOSSBot's software is built using the latest versions of the above technologies, including Docker, continuous integration, and microservices integration (CI) logic. As mentioned in the introduction, programming the robot can be done in different ways which are followed and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware is based on a Raspberry-Pi zero that controls everything and a set of electronics comprising:
- Sensors: Ultrasonic distance sensor, Battery Sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Odometers, IR Receiver, Line detection sensors, Light Sensors
- Interaction Features: Speaker and Front RGB LED
- General Features: Brick-compatible surface, Hole in the front for attaching a marker/pencil, a special pulling loop, rechargeable batteries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the plastic parts, except the wheels, are printable on a 3D printer and the total printing time does not exceed 36 hours. It is worth mentioning that the body of the robot has been designed in such a way as to facilitate its assembly process. This has been achieved since cases have been designed inside the robot, and adapted to the electronic components so that they are placed in the corresponding positions and do not move during the use of the robot. Also, on the outer surface, there are printed symbols that indicate the position of each sensor. The symbols also help teachers to know the position of the sensors, e.g. speaker, led, etc. The vertical tube that runs from top to bottom of the main body of the robot allows for the attachment of a pencil or marker so that by moving the FOSSBot around an area covered with paper, shapes can be created.
Printed meshes on the front and top of the robot help keep electrical parts cool. The robot's charging port, on/off switch, and a unique loop for towing small items are all located on the back. The loop also serves to protect the robot from minor collisions. Two printed spoilers above the wheels add to wheel protection and to the robot's aesthetic design.
The top surface of the robot is divided into two pieces. A cover that attaches to the main body using unique clips is the original accessory. The main cover can be joined to the top cover using an easy twist-and-lock function. It can be easily removed to give access to the interior of the robot and can also support a base of plastic bricks, allowing bricks to be added on top of the robot. This option enables lower-grade teachers to combine FOSSBot with other projects and can help add new activities to FOSSBot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lua for the lazy C developer</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Larry Wall (of Perl fame) famously cited Laziness as one of the three great
virtues of the software developer (the other 2 being Impatience and Hubris).
C is still the lingua franca of systems programming, but if you want to do C
programming right one thing you can't afford is to be lazy. You have to do
manual memory management, behavior is written in stone at compile time and
the joke goes that every non-trivial project has it's own linked list
implementation. There exists however a not so well-hidden superpower that allows
you to program in C, get the performance where it counts, and still
have plenty of time for chatter around the coffee machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That superpower is the Lua programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lightning talk will approach Lua from a C programmer's
perspective: how Lua can help alleviate some pain points of C, illustrate some
common patterns for how to integrate Lua with C (and vice versa) and how you can
get up and running with Lua in your C project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>I2P: Major Changes of the Peer-to-Peer Network</title>
        <subtitle>Cryptography of I2P Received a Major Update - an Overview of the Changes and its Impacts</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I2P ("Invisible Internet Project") is a peer-to-peer overlay network. Overlay networks (inappropriately called "darknet") are able to anonymize peers and to fully encrypt all messages within a network. I2P gained more attention in 2022. Lately some important changes to the protocol layer of I2P have been implemented: the cryptography has been modernized and the software packages were released end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short talk shows the major changes, and whether the performance and stability of the I2P network got improved. This is one of the I2P reseed server maintainers and application developers talking (see links).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation has the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short introduction: the I2P network (3')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of the latest changes (3')&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Nym Mixnet</title>
        <subtitle>Intro to a new anonymous communication network</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about Nym, a new anonymous overlay network for the internet based on mixnet. Unlike other privacy-enhanced technologies like OpenVPN and Tor, Nym defends against global passive adversaries that have a "God's eye" view of the entire network, like the NSA. Nym does this by mixing internet packets at nodes so they do not exit the mixnet in FIFO, as well as adding fake traffic. Like Tor, any application and use SOCKS proxies to bind to Nym. As Nym is built in Rust, it also allows WebSockets and other direct integration. We can demonstrate how the Nym mix network hides network-level metadata from everything from Bitcoin to Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nym has been supported by both H2020 PANORAMX and Next Generation Internet projects on the EU level. Although the original project was started by a Neuchatel-based startup, the project takes contributions from volunteers. Mix nodes are ran in a decentralized manner and keep track of their reputation using the NYM token. Currently, there are approximately 500 mix nodes, but new nodes and applications are welcome. Nym works well for asynchronous, message-based traffic like instant messaging and e-mail, while Tor works better for synchronous, circuit-based traffic like Web browsing. Both projects should be able to work together to provide full-privacy for users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Keyoxide: verifying online identity with cryptography</title>
        <subtitle>A novel approach to secure decentralized online identity</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Just as we need the ability to prove real-world identity, so will the need arise in the digital domain as the offline world slowly merges with the online world. But this time, let's improve on the concept and give people full sovereignty over their identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keyoxide is a new decentralized tool to verify online identities using modern cryptography through a system of claims and proofs. People use it to establish a verifiable digital passport that links to all their online accounts. These passports can even be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk briefly introduces the concept of online identity and explains how Keyoxide went about solving it in a decentralized way, using established cryptography standards and infrastructure, without needing blockchain-related technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gallia is an extendable pentesting framework with the focus on the automotive domain.
The scope of the toolchain is conducting penetration tests from a single ECU up to whole cars.
Currently, the main focus lies on the &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72439.html"&gt;UDS&lt;/a&gt; interface.
Acting as a generic interface, the logging functionality implements reproducible tests and enables post-processing tasks.
This work was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.secforcars.de/"&gt;SecForCARs&lt;/a&gt; project (grant no. 16KIS0790).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jubako is a new generic "container" file format. It allows you to store content and metadata is one file. You can read your data from the file in a efficient manner, without uncompress/extract the data from the file.
We will also see Arx, a file archive (equivalent to tar/zip) which use Jubako.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jubako is a new generic "container" file format.
It is to storage what XML is to serialization. It specify how you store things but it is up to you to define what do you want to store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jubako support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrary content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrary metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selective compression (some content may be compressed while other may not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient random access (no need to extract the data to read it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of consumer open-source products out there, beyond the realm of developer tools. There are now open-source competitors for almost any proprietary productivity, project and knowledge management, and other digital tools.
But to fully take advantage of open-source so far required at least basic coding knowledge -- without it, one is not able to fork or self-host the software, and is confined to using the cloud version only.
Open-source PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) solutions such as Caprover and Gardens offer a way out. They allow to easily host server-side or web-apps through the UI or CLI, and automate most of the complexity usually associated with setting up and maintaining self-hosted software. This presentation tells a story of how these products came about and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Libre-SOC: From architecture and simulation to test silicon, and beyond</title>
        <subtitle>A design for a fully documented and transparent hybrid CPU-GPU-VPU core, for a family of System-on-Chip products</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Libre-SOC aims to develop a design for a hybrid CPU-GPU-VPU core for a family of System-on-Chip products, from embedded applications, routers, cell phones and laptops, all the way to high performance computing, using proposed scalable vector extensions for the tried and true POWER instruction set. Being a fully documented and transparent design is a core value of the project, ensuring mainline kernel integration with no effort wasted on reversing-engineering proprietary designs covered by NDA (non-disclosure-agreements), while avoiding untrusted binary blobs. The products should “just work”, at its maximum performance and feature set, with full involvement and support for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Libre-SOC labored to produce its first silicon, a test chip, and produced its first Linux-capable networked proof of concept on an FPGA (field programmable gate array) development board. Using a completely FLOSS toolchain, any developer can build and test this design on their own computer, run it in hardware in a supported FPGA development board, or even build a full ASIC chip layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’ll present topics of the ongoing architecture design and formal testing, being written in a modern, developer-friendly, Python-based hardware description language.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Formal verification is the act of proving the correctness of software using mathematics. That means proving that your code is free of bugs and/or follows its specifications. SPARK is both a language (subset of Ada) and a set of tools that bring automatic formal verification in the hands of any developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technology is getting more interest from the industry (e.g. NVIDIA recently) for its extremely powerful properties in terms of safety and security. However, it is not widely known that SPARK is both open source and very easy to start using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will provide quick and easy instructions to start your first formally verified library in SPARK. Using only free and open-source tools and resources (compiler, package manager, IDE, verification tools).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Internet-based data sources and resources continue to grow exponentially, making the mechanisms for searching and discovering insights, and making sense of data, a crucial field of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our talk will present two sister projects, Next Generation Internet (NGI) Search and OpenWebSearch focused on improving the way we search for information in the internet and creating new mechanisms to improve transparency, privacy, and trust, contributing to the overall vision of a more human-centric Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Internet-based data sources and resources continue to grow exponentially, making the mechanisms for searching and discovering insights, and making sense of data, a crucial field of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our talk will present two sister projects, Next Generation Internet (NGI) Search and OpenWebSearch.
The objective of the former is to support innovative projects to develop trustworthy solutions towards the development of new ways of searching data by addressing the challenges of power cognitive search, natural language processing, and social computing amongst other cutting-edge fields through five Open Calls. The projects will be compliant with open, collaborative and unbiased values.
On the other hand, NGI OpenWebSearch has its origins in concerns over the imbalance of the search engine market, that are dominated and limited by a few gatekeepers.  Thus, information as public good, with free, unbiased, and transparent access is not under public control anymore. Over the next three years the researchers will develop the core of a European Open Web Index (OWI) as a basis for a new Internet Search in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both projects will lead to more transparency and choice with a focus on privacy and trust, contributing to the overall vision of a more human-centric Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Connecting from the browser to a public server with a valid TLS certificate is easy. But what if the server has a self-signed certificate? What if it isn't public? What if it is another browser?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the intricacies of browser communication beyond the standard browser-to-server use-case. I will give an overview of the many protocols available and how they can be used in a peer-to-peer fashion without sacrificing authenticity, confidentiality or integrity. We will leverage the new WebTransport for secure communication to public servers with self-signed certificates and WebRTC for secure communication to other browsers, using hole puching, without the dependency on central infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Swiss ISP SWITCH has developed a scalable IPFIX exporter built using Snabb. In 2022 the application gained many new features, and was upstreamed into the main Snabb repository. We will showcase a production-grade Snabb application, and discuss implementation challenges and how Snabb helps you deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges keep raising the bar for the security monitoring systems to deal with. From limiting visibility resulting to more and wider encryption adoption to log volumes, to sophistication and amplification of malware attacks and threat actors.
When multiple systems and integrations are involved the defenders are even more overwhelmed with engineering related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APTs and malware actors use any means necessary at their disposal. So should the blue teams around the globe.
The need for more visibility and faster response arises dramatically. Being able to have full network forensic evidence - including protocol, flow file transactions and packet capture to support the IDS generated alerts - is essential for defenders. However the sheer volume and infra needs can be prohibitive for many deployments scenarios as it is not always only related to just cost. If Open Standard is a key element in lowering the cost and complexity of integration, information sharing is a key element in getting fast detection and reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will walk through some of the challenges that Suricata faces and has solved as it keeps evolving. All that while doing an actual hands on review of real life examples of CVEs exploits and APT, Ransomware proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Due to the uniqueness in infrastructure (e.g. ICS vs corporate network), protocols, and cybersecurity threats,
network administrators need to have a simple yet effective way to define rules for accounting, detecting and alerting users
when specific conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we want to show how ntopng can be used as a scriptable system capable of reacting to network
events, by autonomously triggering actions or emitting notifications thanks to its scriptable detection engine
based on checks, scriptable actions and notifications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing growth of the Internet and corporate traffic, links speed and number of connected devices and users,
monitoring and controlling the infrastructure to ensure reliable and safe communications becomes more and
more a hard task. Due to the uniqueness in infrastructure (e.g. ICS vs corporate network), protocols, and cybersecurity threats,
network administrators need to have a simple yet effective way to define rules for accounting, detecting and alerting users
when specific conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we want to show how ntopng can be used as a scriptable system capable of reacting to network
events, by autonomously triggering actions or emitting notifications thanks to its scriptable detection engine
based on checks, scriptable actions and notifications.
ntopng performs network traffic analysis through checks that are executed on various entities including flows
(network communications), hosts and networks and can be used to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save man time by automating manual operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inform management about critical events, including network performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement cybersecurity threat detection and response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create custom traffic reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emit alerts when specific traffic patterns are observed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The scripting API is currently available for Lua and Python in addition to C++, and it has been designed not to reduce the application
performance during traffic processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Time Sensitive Networking is not a new thing per se,
since nowadays many dedicated real-time fieldbusses have been replaced by ethernet,
and the deterministic transfer of data over ethernet has now become a necessity in a variety of industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From audio-visual data, over industrial control, to steering data in automotive or avionic applications,
all these applications require continuous and reliable delivery of data in predetermined timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give a brief introduction into the requirements of said applications and
provide an overview over the different hardware and software components
of TSN applications and how they can be implemented using a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At FOSDEM 2022 I presented libp2p's hole punching mechanism, overcoming NATs and firewalls with no dependencies on central infrastructure. One year has passed since. We rolled it out to live networks. We launched a large measurement campaign with many volunteers deploying vantage points in their home network, punching holes across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give an overview of the largest hack of the internet (aka. hole punching), dive into learnings running it on IPFS (~50_000 nodes) and finally present the data collected through our measurement campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you always wondered how hole punching works, how much more successful UDP is over TCP, whether IPv4 or v6 makes a difference, which ISP is most friendly to p2p and how to overcome symetric NATs, join for the talk!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Creating a CNI plugin is a simple, but mostly undocumented, task. If you add plugin chaining the complexity is lofted by a layer. We’ll be getting you to where you can create your base plugin and add it to a chain, and inspect the links of that chain, the CNI result passed between each.
With CNI chains each plugin depends on information created at the previous step in the chain. We’ll be relying on tools such as cnitool, dummy CNI plugins to chain and custom json configs. We'll show the tools we use every day to create a multi-step CNI plugin in a NetworkAttachmentDefinition.
We’ll talk about how to use different capabilities, handle logging and writing a custom plugin in the chain. We’ll revisit concepts from the CNI spec such as prevResult and go from zero to a working multi-chain CNI plugin. We'll talk about how we architect CNI plugins to make debugging easier, and how to deploy them in a testing and production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Configuring your network setup can be hard sometimes, especially for sysadmins working with remote systems. Nmstate is a library with an accompanying command line tool that manages host networking settings in a declarative manner. In this talk we will see how Nmstate will help us to exploit the full potential of NetworkManager by making use of checkpoints, rollbacks and verifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuring routes, routing policy, DNS and interfaces have never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Mesh" is the new hotness when it comes to Wi-Fi. Routers, extenders and wireless range extenders all propose to work together to optimize your Wi-Fi experience. This is where prplMesh comes in.
prplMesh is an open source implementation of the Wi-Fi Easymesh standard. It helps organize your network by making onboarding easier, coordinate settings between devices and steer devices to the correct access point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll go over some of the challenges of coordinating Wi-Fi devices, and how we use (and develop) open source and open standards to make Wi-Fi better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cilium provides an alternative option for the current Service Mesh ecosystem which eliminates service mesh sidecars to improve performance and reduce latency, operational complexity, and resource usage. By the end, the audience will be able to understand and implement a Cilium service mesh that meets their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Service meshes are becoming the secure, observable networking layer for distributed computing systems like Kubernetes. However, they are also known for their operational complexity and steep learning curve. This talk will help clear up the mess around service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start by introducing what a service mesh is intended to do before diving into hands-on demos using Cilium Service Mesh powered by eBPF. The audience will learn how to monitor service-to-service connectivity, collect tracing data and golden metrics using standard Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry with eBPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will close by discussing how eBPF eliminates service mesh sidecars to improve performance and reduce latency, operational complexity, and resource usage. By the end, the audience will be able to understand and implement a service mesh rather than mess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols, including BGP. In the past year, the native go based BGP implementation has been replaced by an integrated FRRouting instance running in a container.
In this talk I am going to briefly introduce how MetalLB leverages BGP to implement Kubernetes services, describe the integration mechanism with FRR and how it made the MetalLB evolution faster and easier. I'll finally explain how the MetalLB CI works, and how we leveraged FRR to mimic various network topologies in order to extend number of scenarios we want to cover.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized file system for building the next generation of the internet. IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. In this talk, we’ll dive into how decentralised storage with IPFS works under the hood as it builds on top of many long-known, well established techniques and yet is more than just the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover basic working principles like content-addressing and content-routing, followed by the results of an extensive measurement campaign. Answering questions like: How does content-addressing work? Who stores my data if I upload something to IPFS? How do you retrieve content if you only know the hash of it? How fast is that process?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>CNI Automagic: Device discovery for semantic network attachment in Kubernetes</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Network</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CNI plugins – we love them for getting our Kubernetes networking untangled. Sometimes – we want to manage them in a more cloud-native fashion, using Kubernetes itself. Doug is here to guide you on a tour of a proof-of-concept CNI plugin, one that automagically probes your nodes for devices, and allows you (or your Kubernetes controllers! Or your AI/ML!?) to add semantics to your Kubernetes network attachment – and help you answer the question: “Which network am I really attaching my pods to?”, letting you express how to map your pod networking to devices, and to networks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, when you use the reference CNI plugins, such as macvlan and ipvlan CNI, you’re given a kind of magical power: Using native Linux capabilities for networking your workloads in Kubernetes. This is low level and powerful. We all know that networking isn’t simple when you’re in the real world, there’s lots of existing infrastructure and grim realities of data centers. Flexibility is clutch here, and low level solutions help us to build towards these realities. However, Kubernetes is meant for scale, and for expression of intent at a higher level. This approach is an example of how we can meet these requirements for low-level definitions of our network attachments to meet Kubernetes goal of large scale – especially at scale and in non-uniform server environments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will encompass a demo of a brand new CNI plugin and auxiliary components which allow you to map devices to networks, and associate your pods attachments to devices at a higher level, with more automagic, so you don’t have to baby the workload specifications at the lowest possible level, and take advantage of how Kubernetes can help you orchestrate these attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll learn a lot about CNI! You’ll get instructions to take home on how to get this CNI plugin running in your own lab, and it’ll give you a test bed for learning how to make your own CNI plugins too. Even if you’re not a CNI plugin developer, it’ll help you understand better what your CNI plugins are doing, and help you diagnose issues in your own Kubernetes deployment. We’ll also talk about device plugins for Kubernetes and you’ll get to learn about how device availability impacts scheduling workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this talk encourages you to get into the nitty gritty of CNI – Doug really wants to invite you to become a participant in bigger picture efforts for the Kubernetes networking community, too. There is a nascent Kubernetes-native MultiNetworking effort, the Kubernetes Network Plumbing Working Group, and upcoming work for CNI 2.0. This talk, and PoC project represents some problems that we need to solve as a community – If we don’t represent the community and what we all want – we lose out to the commercial efforts which will steamroll the community and leave our (already overtaxed!) sysadmins in the dirt. We all need common ground to work together upon, and it’s up to the community to set those standards and let the commercial efforts follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNI is the “Container Networking Interface”, and it’s an API for setting up networking for containers, and also used by Kubernetes. We love it for its simplicity, and for the fact that it’s a common ground for networking in Kubernetes, and we already know, container networking isn’t always easy. What you might not know is that CNI itself is “container orchestration engine agnostic.” For a 1.0, this limitation makes sense, and we need to respect the origins of this thinking, and it allows some overarching constructs that are useful for both orchestration engines, and container runtimes (like crio and containerd), but we need a step forward in terms of Kubernetes given how ubiquitous it’s become, and continues to become in the networking space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug believes that we need an evolution, or potentially, a revolution for CNI 2.0. One that gives us a layer to speak to CNI using Kubernetes. If we don’t have this pathway, it encourages developers to ignore CNI and build their own Rube Goldberg machine, and sysadmins have already had to chase the rolling ball down the chute to light the match to drop the mousetrap enough as it is. We need standards, not contraptions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things when running applications in an environment like Kubernetes is to have good observability and deep insight of their performance. However, for many applications it can be challenging to update existing applications to provide the observability you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cilium leverages eBPF to provide observability data with Prometheus metrics for your applications without having to modify the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we will demonstrate how Cilium powered with Hubble and the Grafana LGTM (Loki for logs, Grafana for visualization, Tempo for traces, Mimir for Metrics) stack is able to show Service to Service communication,  monitor Golden Signals, detect transient network layer issues and identifies problematic API request with transparent tracing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Using a demo application we will demonstrate performance and metrics for that application and how the metrics change when increasing request volumes. We will show how a new configuration of our application introduces error rates and request duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we will demonstrate how tracing headers for the application can be exported with the Hubble HTTP metrics as Exemplars to link metrics to traces in Grafana to monitor each HTTP Request and its duration using Tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience will walk away with knowledge how to monitor service-to-service connectivity, collect tracing data and golden metrics using standard Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry with Cilium and eBPF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a great solution for hosting highly available endpoint applications, but network functions can still prove challenging. VPN gateways are notably tricky, with overlay and underlay conflicts making their deployment an interesting dance. Performance is also a challenging topic when speaking about scale, most importantly when common optimizations like GSO don't really apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the Calico CNI with a VPP dataplane mixed with multus, allowed us exposing multiple k8s managed interfaces to pods, and thus building complex network functions that still benefit from k8s constructs (HA, service discovery, ...). In the end building an highly available Wireguard gateway gets as easy as building any other application. And it can even leverage accelerated interfaces and cryptographic engines, to reach multiple Gbps without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping this architecture could benefit Kubernetes at large, we started drafting a KEP, proposing to upstream the concept of multiple isolated networks, and standardizing their interaction with existing k8s resources.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This year marks 28 years since Java was first released, and it is still consistently in the top 3 most popular programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we'll explore how Java has maintained this popularity level, despite the many newer languages vying for the top.  The second question we'll look at is how Java can maintain its attraction to new and existing developers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Real-time stream processing has its own challenges such as windowing, event time and late events, streaming fault tolerance, and processing guarantees. In this talk, I will address those challenges and demonstrate the best practices for real-time stream processing, from data ingestion to data processing with ultra-low latency at scale and at speed, using the Hazelcast platform. I will discuss how you can optimize your real-time streaming projects in the following areas: scalability, performance, failover, reliability, and data recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Keep your dependencies in check&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Log4Shell, Spring4Shell, etc. have taught us anything, it's that we need to keep our dependencies up to date. But updating our applications can take a lot of time. How do we stay on top of that, while also continuing to deliver business value?
Luckily, there are plenty of tools that can help us with this, from package managers to bots that can automatically create changes on our repositories. Let's go over some of the different options, so we can make informed choices about what's best for us in a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Conferences love to show you the latest and greatest framework versions and language features. But those new technologies can feel a world away back at work. And it can be hard to justify the time spent to upgrade something that’s not broken, such as JUnit 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you could migrate in mere minutes? With OpenRewrite you can! A collection of fine grained recipes combine to achieve large scale migrations of frameworks and tools related to the JVM. And since it uses a lossless semantic tree, refactorings are guaranteed safe.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Upgrade Spring, Micronaut and Quarkus. Adopt JUnit 5; switch to AssertJ. Replace Log4j with Logback. Fix Checkstyle violations. A world of quick and easy migrations awaits!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How the  Eclipse Foundation, industry and academic partners are working together to address the challenge of measuring and improving the security posture of open-source projects in practical, compelling and above all adoptable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Foundation is partnering with the Linux Foundation and others to find practical and adaptable ways of improving project security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From simple process aspects like having a stated vulnerability process to more sophisticated elements such as SBOMs or secure build processes.
There are many ideas, tools, checklists and opinions.  This session will explain how the EF is planning to navigate this space to create a compelling framework that will allow projects to improve with limited or no impact.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch is nowadays one of the most widely used and deployed full text search engines containing a large amount of capabilities. How how are they actually implemented and how does Elasticsearch operate behind the scenes ? This session will reveal the innerworkings behind the core capabilities of Elasticsearch. We will provide a review of Elasticsearch architecture and general structure of the public Apache 2.0 codebase. Further expanding on that knowledge we will develop a relatively simple ingest plugin in Java that filters certain keywords from indexed documents.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Delivering software fast is one piece of the CI/CD puzzle, but delivering it securely is the glue that keeps your puzzle from falling apart. Software supply chain attacks are on the rise with security exploits directly targeting open source projects, central repositories, and software package managers. Now that developers are the target of security attackers, how do you protect your DevOps pipeline?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)  is working to solve. To help ensure a secure SDLC, the CDF is investing in projects that provide security solutions and in 2022 announced a new incubating project, Pyrsia. This talk will highlight the importance of securing your software supply chain at the source and how Pyrsia is working to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>What I Miss In Java (The Perspectives Of A Kotlin Developer)</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Friends of OpenJDK</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Java has been my bread and butter for almost two decades. Several years ago, I started to learn Kotlin; I never regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Kotlin compiles to JVM bytecode, I sometimes have to write Java again. Every time I do, I cannot stop pondering why my code doesn’t look as nice as in Kotlin. I miss some features that would improve my code’s readability, expressiveness, and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is not meant to bash Java but to list some features I’d like to find in Java.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Controlling electronics with Java and Pi4J is a perfect way to further extend your knowledge and learn about hardware and various communication protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022 articles were published on Foojay.io about using SDKMAN, JBang, Vaadin, Kotlin, and many more on the Raspberry Pi. These prove that Java and the JVM are a perfect match with this small and inexpensive Linux PC for experiments, pet projects, learning, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look back at what has been realized in 2022 regarding #JavaOnRaspberryPi and what we can expect in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Write Once, Run Anywhere... Well, What About Heterogeneous Hardware?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Friends of OpenJDK</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The emergence of heterogeneous hardware resources has posed a significant obstacle for the Java programming language to keep up with the “Write Once Run Anywhere” paradigm. The reality is that several parts of the Java Virtual Machine must be modified to make Java portable for execution on modern heterogeneous hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs. To tackle that challenge, TornadoVM is implemented in the University of Manchester as an open-source software technology that enables OpenJDK and other JDK distributions to offload parts of Java applications onto heterogeneous hardware for parallel execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the latest features of TornadoVM, and it will showcase examples of how the TornadoVM API can be utilized to abstract heterogeneous hardware and increase the performance of Java applications. The goal is to explain the basic terms of TornadoVM including all new API extensions, in order for developers to take advantage of heterogeneous hardware with minimal effort. Finally, this presentation will discuss how TornadoVM is used in research and industry for the acceleration of Java applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The Next Frontier in Open Source Java Compilers: Just-In-Time Compilation as a Service</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Friends of OpenJDK</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For Java developers, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is key to improved performance. However, in a container world, the performance gains are often negated due to CPU and memory consumption constraints. To help solve this issue, the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM provides JITServer technology, which separates the JIT compiler from the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JITServer allows the user to employ much smaller containers enabling a higher density of applications, resulting in cost savings for end-users and/or cloud providers. Because the CPU and memory surges due to JIT compilation are eliminated, the user has a much easier task of provisioning resources for his/her application. Additional advantages include: faster ramp-up time, better control over resources devoted to compilation, increased reliability (JIT compiler bugs no longer crash the application) and amortization of compilation costs across many application instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will dig into JITServer technology, showing the challenges of implementation, detailing its strengths and weaknesses and illustrating its performance characteristics. For the cloud audience we will show how it can be deployed in containers, demonstrate its advantages compared to a traditional JIT compilation technique and offer practical recommendations about when to use this technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Afraid Of Java Cold Starts In Serverless? Fear Not, Java Is Super Fast!</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For years, we’ve been told that Java suffers from cold starts in AWS Lambda and Serverless in general. Believe it not. Java is extremely fast to start, the simplest Java program starts in milliseconds. It’s the Java app servers, frameworks and libraries that usually slow things down. But there are now many ways to start Java apps fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, I want to show you the truth about Serverless Java and cold starts, what’s slow, what’s fast and why it matters. We’ll explore Piranha Cloud, one of the most modern and fastest Jakarta EE frameworks, and how it can start Java apps very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll explain which Java Virtual Machine optimizations may help if you need to start apps even faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see live for yourselves how Java AWS Lambda functions built with Jakarta EE can start fast and decrease the cold starts to the absolute minimum which you can barely notice.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/crac/Main"&gt;CRaC&lt;/a&gt; (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) is an OpenJDK project for the coordination of Java applications at checkpoints which leverages the &lt;a href="https://criu.org/Main_Page"&gt;CRIU&lt;/a&gt; (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace) library for process snapshotting. This talk will briefly introduce &lt;a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/"&gt;Firecracker&lt;/a&gt;, an open source virtualization technology based on KVM, explain how CRaC can be used with it and compare it with CRIU.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Classics Never Get Old: Two Easy Pieces For GraalVM</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Biased locking was removed from OpenJDK HotSpot JVM some time ago. This move had its reasons, but it resulted in a number of significant performance degradations in existing code. Thus, when non-contended locking optimization can be added, it still benefits virtual machines. Parallel stop-the-world garbage collection is one of the earliest GC variants in HotSpot, and yet it is the best choice in terms of high throughput.
SubstrateVM which powers GraalVM native image supports synchronization monitors and offers serial stop-the-world GC as a basic collector. Due to the increased popularity of pre-compilation and its support in modern frameworks, it is remarkable how playing classical optimization pieces helps to improve the performance of such code.
BellSoft recently put locking and garbage collection enhancements for public review. It is interesting that within GraalVM project both were implemented in Java. We'll explore implementation details, benchmark results, and application benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Java profiling relies heavily on the AsyncGetCallTrace API. But this API has major drawbacks: It is unofficial, not well-tested, and omits important information. I propose AsyncGetStackTrace (JEP Candidate 435) as an improved replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview of AsyncGetCallTrace and AsyncGetStackTrace, their implementations, differences, and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Java is a great programming language, however 'traditional' Java isn't so great to work with when it comes to modern, Cloud Native development.  Quarkus is a (fairly) new Java stack that addresses issues such as the typical slow startup time and rather large memory usage that hinder the adoption of Java in container and/or Serverless workloads.  Quarkus is not just useful for optimizing resource usage though.  There is also a big focus on improving the developer experience.  In this session we'll demonstrate how Quarkus is very easy to work with and allows developers to work with containers and external dependencies such as databases, Kafka clusters, Kubernetes etc without being experts in any of these technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
After this session, the audience should come away with inspiration to build modern Cloud Native applications with Java, and have fun doing so!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Fuzion — Intro for Java Developers: Mapping Java's Features to Simpler Mechanisms</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Friends of OpenJDK</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since last year's FOSDEM, the Fuzion language has seen two major enhancements:
algebraic effects and type features.  Algebraic effects provide a means to
manage non-functional side-effects of calls, while type features provide means
to attach logic to type parameters providing more power to generic types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain algebraic effects and type features in Fuzion and show
how they can be used.  Algebraic effects provide means to manage non-functional
aspects like I/O, global and local state, exceptions and much more.  This can be
used to automatically detect security issues due to side-effects.  Many examples
will be given that show how typical code patterns in Java can be realized in a
purely functional way using effects and type features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts
found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into
the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety
features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate
representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis
tools to verify correctness aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algebraic effects are a relatively new mechanism currently in use in some
research programming languages to make side-effects explicit.  The motivation
for this is to make any side-effects explicit and use this information either
for security analysis or to permit optimizations, e.g. to automatically detect
redundant calls or potential for parallelism.  An analysis of side-effects of
library code could have made it clear early on that code contains the log4shell
vulnerability by exposing the side effects of network access and possible
loading of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Algebraic Effects&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algebraic Effects are sets of operations that encapsulate a side-effect in a way
that is orthogonal to otherwise purely functional code.  Algebraic effects
represent values that are additional implicit arguments and results of functions
that depend on an operation provided by an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such functions must be called with an instance of the effect available in the
environment they are called from.  Effects can be installed for a certain region
of code.  Regions using given effects can be nested and inner regions may
replace the effects installed in surrounding regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an operations of an effect is performed, say &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; on a file-I/O effect,
that effect typically returns with a result, in this case the byte read.  Is is
said that the caller resumes operation with the result value.  However, an
operation may as well abort a calculation, which means that it will not return a
result but continue execution at the end of the region for which the effect was
installed.  In the general case, the operation of an effect may resume with 0,
1, or more results, while the effect is responsible of joining the resulting 0,
1, or more execution paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, Java's exception mechanism has a lot in common with effects: The
&lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;-block defines the region, while &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to aborting an
operation and the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clauses perform the required code to
produce a result from a resumed or aborted operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Effects in Fuzion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fuzion, effects are Fuzion features that inherit from base library feature
&lt;code&gt;effect&lt;/code&gt; and define their operations as inner features.  Effects are identified
by their type. Imagine we define an effect &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; that provides an operation &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;,
then we would do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x : effect is
  y(arg some_type) =&amp;gt; ...some operation...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; using effect &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to perform operation &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; given value &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; would then write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f =&amp;gt;
  ...
  x.env.y v
  ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that effect &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is taken from the current environment to call
operation &lt;code&gt;y v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; can be called, we must install an instance of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This can be done as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x.use ()-&amp;gt;f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; creates this instance and &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; installs it while executing the
provided lambda &lt;code&gt;()-&amp;gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, which in this case does nothing but call &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion provides a static analysis tool to determine for each feature the set of
effects a call to that feature may require. There is currently no syntax to
include in a feature declaration the set of effects that feature requires.
However, it is planned that for library code, such syntax will be added to
document the effects directly required.  It is this analysis that permits the
detection of the safety of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Type Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fuzion, features may have type parameters and value parameters, similar to
Java's method that may have generic arguments and 'normal' arguments.  In
Fuzion, however, type parameters are treated much the same way as value
parameters, but they can additionally be used as types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to call a feature on a type argument. A simple example is the
following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f(A type, v A) is
  say "f called with type $A and value $v"

f u16 123
f 123       # using type inference for A
f 3.14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;resulting in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f called with type u16 and value 123
f called with type i32 and value 123
f called with type f64 and value 3.14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fuzion, every feature defines a type, which is the type of its local
instance.  Type features are features declared implicitly for every feature.
Type features duplicate the inheritance tree of their underlying features, such
that type features can be inherited and redefined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The values of type parameters are instances of these type features and the inner
features that can be called are the features defined for the type feature. We
can, e.g., redefine &lt;code&gt;asString&lt;/code&gt; in a type feature as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;point(x, y i32) is

  redef asString      =&amp;gt; "point $x $y"
  redef type.asString =&amp;gt; "!!!my point type!!!"

f (point 3 4)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;resulting in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f called with type !!!my point type!!! and value point 3 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is more powerful than generics as used in Java since we can
define additional functionality, e.g., each type could provide an operation to
compare values of that type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mapping Java to Fuzion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will present code examples of how this will be done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Packages, Classes, Interfaces, instance methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all represented by (nested) Fuzion features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;static methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion does not have static features, every feature is declared as an inner
feature of some outer feature and called on an instance of that outer feature.
However, type features provide a natural place for what is a static method is
Java.  But there is more: these can be inherited and redefined!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Variables updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fuzion, all fields are immutable, i.e., it is not possible to change a
value. In code like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x := 123
say x
x := 2*x
say x
x := x+1
say x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are actually three fields &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; declared, only the later ones masks the
earlier ones.  It is not possible to write a setter as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x := 123

setX(v i32) =&amp;gt;
  x := v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since this would just define a new local field &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; within the feature &lt;code&gt;setX&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutable fields must be declared explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x := mut 123
say x
x &amp;lt;- 2*x
say x
x &amp;lt;- x+1
say x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;works. But the fact that this code performs a mutation is recorded by the
side-effect 'mutate'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, mutable variables are not needed, e.g., in a loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for
  i := 0, i + 1
while i &amp;lt; 10 do
  say i
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new instances of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; are created for each loop iteration, so &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is never
modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I/O operations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD: Will give an example how I/O is performed via an effect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exception handling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example using an untyped try-raise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;divide (a, b i32) =&amp;gt;
  if b = 0
    try.env.raise (error "division by zero!")
  a / b

show_div(a, b i32) =&amp;gt;
  r := try i32 (() -&amp;gt; divide a b)
  match r
    v i32 =&amp;gt; say "ok, result is $v"
    e error =&amp;gt; say "not ok: $e)

show_div 100 12
show_div 100 0
show_div 10 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;static fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immutable static fields in Java are often used for constants. In Fuzion, these
can be just type features resulting in a constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutable static fields, however, are used for side-effects like caching of
intermediate results.  Fuzion effects can be used here as well,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cache effect does this for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;expensive =&amp;gt;
  say "sleeping 3sec..."
  time.nano.sleep (time.durations.seconds 3)
  4711

my_cache(val i32) is

expensive_with_cache =&amp;gt; (cache my_cache (() -&amp;gt; my_cache expensive)).val

say expensive_with_cache
say expensive_with_cache
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Status of Fuzion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion is still in an early prototype stage, but the language is reaching a more
stable state. Some of the syntax shown here is still subject to change.  We are
developing sample code to compare different options and choose a clear syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of examples is shown on the Fuzion website
&lt;a href="https://flang.dev"&gt;flang.dev&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the
&lt;a href="https://flang.dev/tutorial"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://flang.dev/idioms"&gt;idioms&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://flang.dev/design"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzion currently has two back-ends, a Java interpreter and static compiler using C
as intermediate language.  A tool called &lt;em&gt;fzjava&lt;/em&gt; creates Fuzion interfaces for
Java modules such that interaction with arbitrary Java code is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion and Future Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of algebraic effects and powerful type parameters bring Fuzion a
big step ahead as a general purpose language.  The use of algebraic effects
brings a simple and powerful mechanism to provide many features known from
imperative programming languages to functional world while enabling static
analysis to ensure that unwanted side-effects do not occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the language specification becoming more stable, it is now time to develop
a modern standard library and improve the performance of the back-ends. We are
currently a small team of three developers at Tokiwa Software bringing this
ahead, but we are happy get feedback or other active contributors!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The idea of the microkernel OS architecture is more that 50 years old and the term itself is just a few years younger. Over the years, it has been implemented in countless variants and modifications, it has served as a basis for intriguing OS experiments, it has gained strong position in the mission-critical and safety-critical areas and while it is still not the dominant architecture in the general-purpose desktop OS domain, it has had major influence on the "mainstream" operating systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk, however, is not about the history. Instead, we describe where are the microkernel-based operating systems today, who works on them and why, who uses them in production and why, where they aim for the future. The purpose of this talk is also to present the basic practical experiences with the existing microkernel-based operating systems — not to compare them, but to provide the potential users and contributors with an initial sorted list of operating systems they should look into in more detail depending on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Device driver gardening</title>
        <subtitle>Transplant Linux drivers fast but gently</subtitle>
        <track>Microkernel and Component-based OS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Transplanting device drivers out of the Linux kernel has a long history in microkernel-based operating systems. While being economically attractive, in contrast to developing all drivers from scratch, one still has to deal with complex APIs and semantics. Therefore, the porting process can be demanding and tiring together, which leads to new sources of errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years the team around the Genode OS framework has collected a lot of experiences by porting device drivers out of the Linux kernel. Different approaches were followed. Recently, the methodology got reviewed again, new tools were developed, and the process got accelerated substantially. At the same time, the environment for device drivers in Genode got unified in between all architectures, and low-level platform support was enhanced. As a result it is now much easier and faster to port Genode to new boards, or SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk provides an insight into the new porting methodology and tools. It summarizes the results from this new approach that were achieved within a couple of months, and will show them in a short tech-demo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using Genode as an enabler for research on modern operating systems</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Microkernel and Component-based OS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The operating systems in use today and their interfaces and abstractions were designed decades ago and have predominately remained stagnant. In contrast, the evolution of computer hardware has seen significant changes over the decades. The last decade's research has shown that the abstractions and interfaces conceived decades ago have become a bottleneck, so the interplay of OS and applications needs to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exploring new interfaces and abstractions in an OS is a daunting and often intimidating endeavor. One often has to dig into hundreds of thousands of lines of existing OS code or write an OS entirely from scratch for hardware that is either sparsely documented at best or, too often, not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major challenge in developing a research OS is that a vast number of drivers need to be implemented to get the system running. And this effort comes with little or no scientific output at all. This is where Genode can rescue the day with its strictly component-based architecture. It provides the flexibility and extensibility needed to accelerate OS research while also providing the drivers required to get the system running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how Genode can lift the burden of creating new research operating systems. Using our research operating system as an example, we will show how easy it is to explore various OS interfaces and abstractions and how to automate experiments using Genode's scenarios. Furthermore, we will highlight the challenges we faced using Genode on multicore servers and outline what extensions to the framework we needed to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NOVA is a modern open-source microhypervisor that can host unmodified guest operating systems next to critical host applications. After adding support for multiple instruction sets (ARMv8-A and x86_64), NOVA's code base has been restructured to share as much code between architectures as possible. I will give an overview of the new abstractions that make NOVA fit for the next decade and discuss how advanced features, such as boot-time relocation and code patching, multiple resource spaces, support for suspend/resume, cache allocation technology, control-flow protection and multi-key total memory encryption have increased NOVA's flexibility, security and performance even further.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Evolution of OSv: Towards Greater Modularity and Composability</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Microkernel and Component-based OS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;By design, OSv has always been a "fat" unikernel and by default has provided a large subset of &lt;code&gt;glibc&lt;/code&gt; functionality and has included full standard C++ library (&lt;code&gt;libstdc++&lt;/code&gt;), the ZFS implementation, drivers for many devices, and has supported many hypervisors. On one hand, it makes running arbitrary applications on any hypervisor very easy using a single universal kernel. On another hand, such universality comes with the price of the bloated kernel with many symbols and drivers and possibly ZFS unused, thus causing inefficient memory usage, longer boot time, and potential security vulnerabilities. In addition, the C++ applications linked against a version of libstdc++ different than the version the kernel was linked against, may simply not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will talk about enhancements in the new release 0.57 to address these issues. More specifically, I will focus on a new experimental build mode to hide the non-&lt;code&gt;glibc&lt;/code&gt; symbols and &lt;code&gt;libstdc++&lt;/code&gt; and extract ZFS code out of the kernel in form of a dynamically linked library. I will also explain another new build option to tailor the kernel to a set of specific device drivers - 'driver profiles', and another new mechanism to allow building a version of the kernel with a subset of glibc symbols needed to support a specific application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will also cover other interesting improvements and optimizations like "lazy" stack, minimal netlink support, and novel ways to build and run ZFS images.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Helios is a simple microkernel written in part to demonstrate the applicability of the Hare programming language to kernels. This talk will introduce the design and rationale for Helios, address some details of its implementation, compare it with seL4, and elaborate on the broader plans for the system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks. Helios uses Hare to implement a microkernel, largely inspired by seL4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Unikraft (https://unikraft.org/) is an open source unikernel development kit, aiming to get efficiency, speed and security through specialization. During the past year, we updated the Unikraft release model to have more frequent releases allowing for features to be made available sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present the update release, governance, an inner workings of project and present the major technical features added during the past year, together with challenges encountered and the road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will highlight the major technical features added since FOSDEM 22 (release 0.7) until FOSDEM 23 (release 0.12): SMP support (x86, ARM), introduction of Musl as the standard library, update of scheduling implementation and API, virtual memory, security features, new internal libraries (posix-futex, posix-socket, posix-event), new system calls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Running your own custom applications is one of the most important features that make unikernels fit for the cloud. As related work has shown, unikernels can achieve this by compiling or linking them (native) or by providing a binary-compatible interface (e.g., Linux system call ABI). Both modes have their pros and cons, and because specialization is our key concept for the Unikraft OSS project, we support both. In this talk, we will present our implementation design, the challenges that we solved, and the lessons that we learned. Additonally, we will show a demonstration with nginx running in both modes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unikraft is an open source Xen Project incubator under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. The Unikraft open source project is the basis for Unikraft GmbH, a company that aims to build the next generation of cloud with unikernels for production and enterprise use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hardware acceleration for Unikernels</title>
        <subtitle>A status update of vAccel</subtitle>
        <track>Microkernel and Component-based OS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Unikernels promise fast boot times, small memory footprint and stronger
security but lack in terms of manageability. Moreover, unikernels provide a
non-generic environment for applications, with limited or no support for widely
used libraries and OS features. This issue is even more apparent in the case of
hardware acceleration. Acceleration libraries are often dynamically linked and
have numerous dependencies, which directly contradict the statically linked
notion of unikernels. Hardware acceleration functionality is almost
non-existent in unikernel frameworks, mainly due to the absence of suitable
virtualization solutions for such devices.
​
In this talk, we present an update on the vAccel framework we have built that
can expose hardware acceleration semantics to workloads running on isolated
sandboxes. We go through the components that comprise the framework and
elaborate on the challenges in building such a software stack: we first present
an overview of vAccel and how it works; then we focus on the porting effort of
vAccel in various unikernel frameworks. Finally, we present a hardware
acceleration abstraction that expose semantic acceleration functionality to
workloads running as unikernels.
​
We will present a short demo of some popular algorithms running on top of
Unikraft and vAccel show-casing the merits and trade-offs of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>A Rust-Based, modular Unikernel for MicroVMs</title>
        <subtitle>RustyHermit @ FOSDEM 2023</subtitle>
        <track>Microkernel and Component-based OS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Unikernels are specialized, single-address-space machine images built from library operating systems.
They shrink the attack surface and resource footprint of cloud services.
Applications that are compiled into unikernels are able to boot virtual machines.
Using library operating systems enables static analysis of the image's whole software stack: from the kernel to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present the transition from the C-based HermitCore to the Rust-based RustyHermit unikernel.
Using Rust's build system, the unikernel is split into components, whereby the end-user is able to specialize the application and the resulting boot image.
QEMU's microvm virtual platform and Firecracker are lightweight virtual machines (microVMs), which are specialized for cloud environments.
We show the benefits of the component-based architecture to build specialized applications for microVMs.
Minimalistic design of unikernels and microVMs reduce the memory footprint and the attack surface of the complete software stack and build an ideal base for cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Loupe: Designing Application-driven Compatibility Layers in Custom Operating Systems</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Microkernel and Component-based OS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Providing support for mainstream applications is fundamental for a new/custom
OS to have impact in the short and long term. This is generally achieved
through the development of a compatibility layer, currently an ad-hoc and
unoptimized process that involves a vast amount of unnecessary engineering
effort. There is a need for efficient methods to measure precisely what
OS features are really required by a given set of target applications,
gathering results that can help drive the development of compatibility layers
by pinpointing what features should be implemented in priority.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present a streamlined methodology to optimize the
development of the OS features required to build a compatibility layer in order
to support a set of target applications, focusing on the system calls of the
Linux ABI. To avoid engineering effort overestimation, we rely on dynamic
analysis. The methodology revolves around a tool called Loupe that measures,
for every system call invoked by an application processing an input workload
(e.g. benchmark, test suite, etc.), which ones really need to be implemented
and which ones can be faked/stubbed/partially implemented. Given a set of
applications and input workloads, Loupe can compute for a given OS an optimized
compatibility layer development plan, aiming to support as many applications as
possible, as early as possible. We analyze Loupe's measurements over a wide
(100+) set of applications, and demonstrate in particular that the effort
needed to provide compatibility is significantly lower than that determined by
previous works using static analysis: our study shows that as much as 40-60\%
of system calls found in application code are not even needed to successfully
run meaningful workloads and even full test suites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, in basements, factories, buildings and out of doors, millions of tiny (and not-so-tiny!) computers chatter with each other, constantly. But what do they say? And how can we talk to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is an introduction to binary pattern matching, a powerful syntax feature which Elixir has inherited from Erlang. When you learn it, it will open the doors to a world of communication that can otherwise seem obscure. During the talk, we will explore how binary pattern matching can be leveraged to implement low-level, binary communication formats in a succinct and performant manner.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gleam is a friendly statically typed language that targets the BEAM and JavaScript. In this talk we'll take a tour of Gleam by looking at its features, the ecosystem, and its interop with other BEAM languages as well as Javascript. All the while we'll be building up a distributed audio application that allows multiple clients to play with music and audio in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior knowledge of Gleam isn't necessary to get something out of this talk, and both those that are curious and skeptical of static typing are encouraged to attend and learn how Gleam might fit into their practice.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scalability under load. The holy grail of much of a developer's life is that our software survives its beginning. The system went live. Made it to production. Got its first user. But surely, the true test of good software is how it lives up to expectation over its lifetime? After all, you wouldn't say a bridge or building was successful just because the first 100 cars made it across safely. In other forms of engineering, things are load tested under demand either by weight, shocks or overload. As a software developer we should be ensuring SLAs or exploring error conditions under extreme load. But what is “load” in the context of software? And how do we test its many different definitions? In this talk, I will present a relationship made in heaven, the relationship between the actor model and the answer to these questions. I will also introduce you to a library that applies all this knowledge in a ready-to-use dependency.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learning from Python's Jupyter Notebooks, Livebooks are all about getting you up and running as fast as possible. Forget those throwaway prototypes. Livebook gives you a playground to get insights, document snippets and share ideas about anything code-related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll show how we use Livebook to mitigate risks early on in the conception phase. We've used it to assess the feasibility of using Elixir in our tech stack for building solutions in new problem domains, without the need to build the whole thing. Shorten your feedback cycle and get to the core of your problems even faster with Livebook.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AtomVM is a tiny portable virtual machine that allows BEAM code to run on microcontrollers with less than 500KB of RAM such as ESP32, STM32 or RPI 2040 devices.
In few words you can flash AtomVM on a microcontroller such as the ESP32 and get any virtually unmodified code compiled for the BEAM running on it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Thanks to a few features of Elixir, the answer was yes! Here’s how the Axios mobile app’s capacity increased 600% the day before the 2020 US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the language, many interesting tools were implemented for developing in Haskell (REPL, central package archive, property-based testing...). Today, the Haskell tooling provides several powerful and intuitive setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present some useful features provided in a classic modern setup (cabal + HLS + vscode).  Some of these features are also widespread in other programming languages, some are more specific to the Haskell world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Let's take a look at the program (newk) and perform a kata routine focused on reformatting and refactoring simple code in order to discover elements and connections between them. Hackathon friendly, in a really new way ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to show and tell about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cargo-cabal: a CLI tool that helps you to turn in one command a Rust crate into a Haskell Cabal library ;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hs-bindgen: the Rust procedural macro library that generate bindings of function that user wanted to expose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The talk will focus on discussing core design ideas and implementation and end by a quick live-demo of its developer ergonomics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Haskell is a statically-typed purely-functional programming language with non-strict evaluation. These features make programming in Haskell quite different from programming in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will illustrate how to use Haskell for implementing simple 2D animations, firstly using basic functional programming techniques and data types, and then using lenses, for accessing nested data types, and the state monad, for simulating mutable states.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Haskell Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to amplifying the impact of Haskell on humanity and broadening the adoption of Haskell, by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research. Haskell is already used in industry for purposes as varied as payment processing, formal verification of cryptography, freight forwarding, and spam fighting, and its influence can be seen far and wide in the world of programming languages, but more remains to be done. In this talk, I'll give an overview of the key Haskell community infrastructure and point to some opportunities for high-value contributions to the Haskell ecosystem, both for experienced Haskellers and those still learning the language. I'll also talk about how the Haskell Foundation thinks about where we can get the most leverage from our work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Example www.ictgames.com and www.echalk.co.uk and www.topmarks.co.uk en www.clap-lab.com is made with zim. But also https://web-labosims.org/ and others op www.zimjs.com/apps what is called a ZimApp = Zapp = www.Zimjs.com/Zapp :-) Many video's on www.zimjs.com/youtube and articles on zimjs.com/medium = https://drabstract.medium.com/
=&gt; Kids can learn to code into www.zimjs.com/kids/slate , free and no login: but all adults that not can code also ofcourse.
=&gt; Developers with https://devs.zimjs.com for example. All code on www.Zimjs.com/docs = www.zimjs.com/spells .
Have a great &amp;lt;code&gt; magic time with www.Zimjs.com/magic en www.zimjs.com/curriculum with all comments why it is a good followup solution after Scratch.mit.edu!
In a nutshell, Zim Kids is the most visual and rewarding way to introduce children to coding. It's never been easier to create beautiful interactivity with so little code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The content is curriculum aligned and delivered in bite-sized chunks where students are introduced to a concept and immediately get to type some code and see stunning results. Support materials are exceptional too with a video library and sections dedicated to teaching and learning. Everything you need to teach programming on a plate.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MIT App Inventor is an Apache-licensed visual programming environment for building mobile phone apps. In this presentation, we will explore the MIT App Inventor web interface and build a simple image classifier app for Android devices. We will explore collecting training data, training a small machine learning model, and deploying that model as part of an App Inventor app. By the end of the talk, participants will be able to test or install their creation onto an Android device. We will also provide a brief overview of educational resources available to teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Hedy: A gradual and multi-lingual programming language for education</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>FOSS Educational Programming Languages</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When kids learn to program they often use either a visual language like Scratch, or a textual language like Python. While visual languages are great for the first steps, children and educators often want to move on to a textual language. However early on, a textual language and its error messages can be scary and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedy aims bridge this gap with a programming language that is gradual, using different language levels. In level 1, there is hardly any syntax at all; printing is done with: print hello! At every level, new syntax and concepts are added, so learners do not have to master everything at once. Hedy builds up to a subset of Python including conditions, loops, variables and lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make learning as accessible as possible, Hedy allows for the use of localized keywords, f.e in Spanish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;imprimir Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the pedagogy of Hedy as well as its technical aspects, since a set of changing and localized complex grammars poses several interesting challenges for parsing, and a small language offers a lot of potential from improved error messages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Snap! is a Scratch-like programming language that treats code-blocks as first class citizens instead of confining them to an editing modality. Snap! has been developed for UC Berkeley’s introductory computer science course named “The Beauty and Joy of Computing”. Embracing nested data structures and higher order functions Snap! lets learners create arbitrary control structures and even custom programming languages with just blocks. Thus, Snap! bridges the space from low-floor motivational introductory activities to supporting sophisticated rigorous studies of computer science. In this presentation members of the core Snap! development team will deliver a hands-on demo of exemplary projects that exhibit our understanding of both "fun" and intellectual stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a short introduction to TurtleStitch and the communities of educators and learners. While the use of TurtleStitch on formal educational settings (school) focuses on students in secondary education, in informal settings such as maker spaces or in individual use cases, there are also a lot of adult learners using TurtleStitch. The main benefit of TurtleStitch lies in the combination of coding and textile making and thus in its potential to address different interest groups. As part of the talk, some selected examples of designs by learners as well by educators and more advanced developers will be shown, highlighting how easy it is to get started using TurtleStitch as well as its potential generate highly complex design.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yup, you heard me right! I am two years into Nix and NixOS bause I endedup working with a team deeply involved with such technology that I never hear about even if I spent 8years out of 10 doing cloud computing, automation and YAML!
I have to admit it is not easy to pick up, nix is weird, you never know what options to use and now it is all about flakes but I feel powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I want to show you my dotfiles and how I manage my little homelab. I will talk to you about netbooting, nixos-rebuild build-vm. A practical and driven by frustration approach to NixOS&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You want to use Nix at your job to build and deploy your fantastic application. And you even managed to convince your boss or your customer that it’s the right tool to use. Amazing! At this stage, what can possibly go wrong? Developers! While you are enthusiastic about Nix and wholeheartedly love it, your fellow colleagues may be quite skeptical about using a new tool they have never heard of. “My programming language has that shiny build tool that everyone uses, why do I need to use Nix?“, “My OS distribution has standard package manager, why should I install another one?“, “Oh, no-no-no, I once installed Nix and it ate hundreds gigabytes of my disk space, I will never do it again” — these are possible reasons why developers may be quite reluctant to using Nix. You can still go ahead and use it, but you may end up in the situation when nobody else understands and nobody wants to understand how things work, so people will request your help whenever they need to touch anything related to Nix, even if they just need to run one command on their machine. If you don’t want this to happen, before introducing Nix in your codebase it’s important to tell developers what they should expect, what concerns they may have and what to do with them. In this talk, we will elaborate on some intimidating factors of Nix and possible solutions to them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Who cares about immutability, declarative configuration and reproducibility? Well, certainly not the people whom I want to get to use Nix. Let's be creative for our plan to make Nix take over all package management. Tricks, treachery, lies... anything goes to "nixify" the heck out of the world!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Present the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nickel-lang/nickel-nix"&gt;Nixel&lt;/a&gt; library, interfacing Nix and &lt;a href="https://github.com/tweag/nickel"&gt;Nickel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tweag/nickel/"&gt;Nickel&lt;/a&gt; is a generic configuration language, heavily inspired by Nix but adding a number of features such as a gradual type system and a built-in merge system for records. This in turn allows for a better developer experience (error reporting, powerful LSP server, introspectability), more runtime guaranties, and eventually better performances (since there's no need to encode a computationally costly module system into it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nickel-lang/nickel-nix"&gt;Nixel&lt;/a&gt; is an experimental Nickel library allowing to use Nickel for writing Nix configurations. This makes it possible to leverage the niceties of the language for writing modular and user-friendly configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What happens when you have access to large clusters, but have little control over the software installed on the machines? Unfortunately, this is the current scenario that researchers often find in HPC clusters, which include very old software stack, a brittle environment and non-cooperative sysadmins. We have been experimenting with Nix to provide an up-to-date system running on top of the already existing software, without root permissions with the help of user namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we give a tour on the problems we found and how we solved them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting from the installation and configuration of nix to be used by multiple users when we lack a shared &lt;code&gt;/nix&lt;/code&gt; store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding library contamination from &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib&lt;/code&gt; with an isolated root mount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive development while compiling the code inside the isolated environment with a patched nix-portable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding custom compilers to the stdenv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building packages tuned to an specific CPU with vectorization optimizations in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running the benchmarks with SLURM inside the isolated environment with multiple compute nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving MPI fast zero-copy transfer inside user namespaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nix lacks of a static type system could be really annoying when we want to debug our expression, and understand what's part of code or data is wrong. Dynamic types libraries[1][2] comes to the rescue, giving a simple API to assert that data is valid.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nix has for a long time been struggling with a very low (~1) bus factor and a lack of clear development process, leading to some frustration from both users and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy that, we've recently created &lt;a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-team-creation/22228"&gt;the Nix team&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of collectively “tak(ing) ownership of the Nix source code”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents that Nix team, and gives a glimpse at the Nix development process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Runix is a Rust library for interfacing with the Nix command line. It provides typed structs for Nix commands, with typed flags, and interfaces which match with Nix’s underlying classes. It also makes it possible to have a FFI into Nix from Rust. It should greatly improve the state and stability of calling the Nix CLI in your libraries. This talk will introduce the reasoning behind this library in our work at flox, and what it can do for Nix in general.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nix, and by extension NixOS, are incredible tools to define infrastructures and deployments of dedicated machines. Unfortunately, sometimes the load is too big for even an optimized network stack and we need to get dedicated equipment such as load balancers to handle the load. What if we could configure those from within Nix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P4, a Domain Specific Language intended to produce highly optimized network processing code, allows for that. It can produce code that can be synthesized to FPGAs or even configure network ASICs in order to have optimized solutions to those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points we'll touch on: Writing a transpiler in Nix, Automatic (re-)deployment of synthesized code, hardware definition for Nix-reprogrammable hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an overview about the state of Lanzaboote, a set of tools that enable Secure Boot for NixOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UEFI Secure Boot is a firmware security feature that prevents untrusted code from booting on a system. Users can utilize this technology to prevent certain kinds of attacks that involve booting malicious code on their computers. Unfortunately, NixOS has no support for Secure Boot yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will give a short background of Secure Boot, go through NixOS-specific challenges, and explain the strategy we took for enabling Secure Boot in NixOS. We will highlight the newly developed components, such as a custom UEFI boot stub and companion Linux userspace tool, which are both written in Rust. Finally, we will explain the current state of upstreaming Secure Boot support in NixOS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AMENDMENT Covid Exposure Notification Out in the Open</title>
        <subtitle>Developing an Open Implementation of the Google/Apple Exposure Notification Protocol</subtitle>
        <track>Public Code and Digital Public Goods</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Covid 19 pushed national and international cooperation to its limits, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of our ambition to solve complex social problems using technology. One such area was Exposure Notification: using mobile phones to detect exposure to Covid. In this talk I'll chart my experiences developing an open source implementation of the GAEN protocol, which turned into the Sailfish OS Contrac App, with equivalent functionality to Germany's Covid Warn App developed by SAP.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Exposure Notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Exposure Notification was to use mobile phones to detect potential exposure to Covid 19 carriers, and to then communicate this information to the appropriate people in a suitably privacy-respecting way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different countries chose different methods for achieving this, but within Europe the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) protocol become one of the most widely used approaches. The protocol satisfied two important requirements: interoperability and privacy. The first comes from its deployment to all up-to-date Google and Apple devices everywhere in the world, offering truly global interoperability. The second from the careful and thoughtful design of the protocol itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will chart my experiences developing my own open source implementation of the GAEN protocol for use with Germany's exposure notification infrastructure. This eventually turned into the open source libcontrac library, and the Sailfish OS Contrac App, with equivalent functionality to that of the German Covid Warn App developed by SAP. Contrac gained quite widespread use within the Sailfish community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Working with Other Organisations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple released a specifications for the protocol very early on, and using this it was possible to release a cross-platform open-source library implementation of the protocol even before the official version rolled out to Android and iOS phones. However, this only tackled half of the problem, since the infrastructure for communication with health authorities was developed separately and independently by each country that used it, and this wouldn't be deployed until later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will therefore also talk about SAP's Covid Warn App backend implementation. SAP put great effort into developing this using an open source model. On the one hand their approach was very successful and achieved its purported goals, in that it made it possible to develop a fully-independent, fully open-source, fully-functional re-implementation of the Covid Warn App for use on Linux-based mobile phones. On the other hand, my personal experience of working with the project left something to be desired. In this talk I will therefore also explore some of the traps that organisations fall into when managing large, government-level, open source projects, and in particular in relation to how they interact with small independent contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be 20 minutes but have been expanded due to cancellations of other talks just before the schedule freeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AMENDMENT Global Open Source Quality Assurance of Emergency Supplies</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Public Code and Digital Public Goods</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 birthed a movement to use open source to address crises through rapid distributed manufacture of medical supplies and emergency equipment. However, even in drastic crises, labeling, tracking, quality assurance and authenticity is required. The Global Open Source Quality Assurance System (GOSQAS) proposes to solve this with an open provenance tracking system that will track the maker’s mark, self-asserted and 3rd-party quality tests, and changes in custody accessible with a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About a dozen nonprofits have formed an alliance to promote quality assurance for open source (free-design) devices and supplies. Open source emergency devices and medical supplies can be rapidly manufactured with distributed systems, such as hobbyists with 3D printers. This can quickly repair supply chains broken by war or natural disaster. However, the normal reputational and legal mechanisms for ensuring quality and authenticity don’t function well in such crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open source solution to this is to be as transparent as possible. In the case of physical devices, this means that a would-be buyer of the device should be able to easily look up: when, where, how, and by whom it was made, what quality assurance tests have been performed on it, maintenance performed, etc. By maintaining the complete chain-of-custody, counterfeiting can be effectively mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, encryption will allow provenances to be kept appropriately private. This proposed system does not compete with other tracking systems, but can be used to complement them on a purely voluntary basis. Eventually, people will demand full and transparent provenances for many devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we discuss the movement, the problems, and the proposed approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 09.40 but have been postponed to give room for the talk Covid Exposure Notification Out in the Open to be longer to cover for cancellations of other talks just before the schedule freeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AMENDMENT Public Money? Public Code! in Europe </title>
        <subtitle>A policy brief of the state of play of Free Software in the European Union</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the framework of the “Public Money? Public Code!” campaign, the FSFE is demanding legislation that requires that publicly financed software developed for the public sector should be made publicly available under a Free Software licence. This talk will provide a brief overview of the state of play of previous and ongoing EU legislative procedures focused on digital transformation, in which the FSFE has been actively advocating for public code. We will take a look at the impact of such involvement and the challenges that still lie ahead for software freedom in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Political decisions have a large impact on Free Software, its ecosystem, and its communities. The FSFE has been taking part in consultations, public discussions and in sharing our demands with decision-makers in order to recognise the importance of Free Software in the ongoing digital transformation of Europe. With the help of the framework of our “Public Money? Public Code!” campaign, we are demanding legislation that requires that publicly financed software developed for the public sector should be made publicly available under a Free Software licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will delve into the EU Declaration of Digital Rights and Principles, the ongoing AI Act, as well as recently proposed Cyber Resilience Act, and the Product Liability Directive. We will further discuss the European Commission communication: "Open Source Strategy: Think Open”. This will help us analysing the shift of wording that has taken place on the part of the EU institutions until now but also to highlight some of the loopholes that still exist in such legal frameworks. We will finally list some of the challenges that we have to overcome to assure more public code in the public sector in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 10.00 but have been postponed to give room for the talk Covid Exposure Notification Out in the Open to be longer to cover for cancellations of other talks just before the schedule freeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Discuss importance of funding and talent allocated to community work when investing in DPGs. You can’t just invest in the bytes; the bytes have no value of their own. It is everything else around the bits and bytes that matter!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Digital Public Good Standard is fast approaching its two-year anniversary. The Digital Public Good Alliance (DPGA) has built a registry of Open Source solutions and tools that address the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. But how do we know whether a DPG itself is sustainable? To date, we still don’t have a common way of measuring or knowing whether a DPG has what it takes to succeed and scale for different use cases. The variable for time remains unsolved in the current DPG equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For folks who participate in the funding and development of DPGs, how can we build better DPGs with open and inclusive communities? Are there pitfalls to avoid or key lessons to follow? Justin &amp;amp; Vipul will explore the life cycle of a DPG and why building in the open earlier builds better DPGs. This talk will look at DPGs and DPG nominees in different phases of development: early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The European Commission’s Open Source Observatory (OSOR) Team will present the Interoperable Europe Act (IEA) and its implications for the free and open source software ecosystem. The text, which the European Commission adopted as a proposal in November 2022, aims to reinforce the cross-border interoperability of the public sector in the EU. Practically, it aims to facilitate “the co-creation of an ecosystem of interoperability solutions across the EU”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the regulation sets up a two-layer governance structure (the Interoperable Europe Board and the Interoperable Europe Community), with both entities expected to work closely with open source experts, institutions and companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will in particular dig into the mechanisms meant to enable the sharing and reuse of interoperability solutions between public administrations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The OSOR Team will present the measures of the proposed Act that support the sharing and reuse of software and cross-border interoperable solutions, such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-layer governance structure—the Interoperable Europe Board and the Interoperable Europe Community—with both entities expected to work closely with open source experts, institutions and companies.&lt;br/&gt;
Interoperable Europe Agenda: the strategy for the coordination of public investments in interoperability solutions.
Interoperable Europe Portal: Single point of entry for information related to cross-border interoperability, Interoperable Europe solutions and interoperability solutions provided for by other EU policies.
Interoperability Assessment: Obligatory when creating or modifying IT systems for public services with cross-border aspects. The content of the assessment will be adopted by the IE Board.
Regulatory Sandboxes: Controlled environment for the development of interoperable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the presentation, the audience is invited to discuss the new EU proposal with the OSOR Team, as well as how the European open source ecosystem can support this policy effort as members of the Interoperable Europe Community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 11.50 but starts earlier to cover for cancellations of other talks just before the schedule freeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Natural language translation is an automated process in which text from one language (e.g. English) is translated to another (e.g. French). In this talk we introduce LibreTranslate, a FOSS package that combines state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithms, pre-trained language models and a simple RESTful API.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LibreTranslate enables the addition of automated translation logic to third party applications and offers a FOSS alternative to proprietary translation services such as Google Translate or Yandex Translate. You can run it from your laptop, too! No data-center scale servers required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Weblate is proudly a libre SW and helps many FOSS projects of various sizes to engage and enlarge their communities, and bring their creations closer to their users. It became an essential tool over the ten years since the first version. Knowing this, we will talk about the responsibility, project news, recently added and also notably useful features, and some plans. You will also see what works for openSUSE, Fedora, Libre Office, KODI, and other happy FOSS users.
All your Weblate questions will be gladly answered, of course.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL has supported national language support (NLS) (that is, message translations) with Gettext for over twenty years.  This has been a valuable feature, but naturally not without challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been involved in this effort as a toolsmith, organizer, and translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had interesting challenges making Gettext work reliably in a client/server system and to make it cooperate with the other internationalization facilities in the system.  We also had to write a lot of our own tooling to manage the translation work, merges with the code, and so on.  We also have translations of the documentation, which use separate workflows.  PostgreSQL is a relatively small community and the software is mostly not facing end users, so the possibilities for recruiting translators and other volunteers for this are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I want to give an account of the work we have done in the PostgreSQL project to make translation and internationalization in general an integral part of the project and start a conversation with other practitioners about best practices and the future of the tooling.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How the Frenche translation team of Debian provides ays for anyone to contribute&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Debian French localization team has an old-fashion translation system, in general. Many things use mail, the doc is not quite easy to learn, our tools are old, and the distro does not use modern tools such as Pottle or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to plan a such evolution, as Debian is large, the staff of administrators is small and busy, and covering all the translation subprojects is a very challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the debian-facile wiki page, I suggest a way in order to ensure the new translator walks at his/her owh rhythm, meets the team, understands the process, and so on. Of course, we need support, help and persons, but at least it lets persons not using modern tools to contribute and, if they want, become a Debian Developer not uploading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us introduce this way and how a beginner can take stuff to get involved, and see the challenges at each of such steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is more or less clear which tools to use when translating the text in the software itself, but not so much for documentation, especially when this documentation evolves and needs to be updated.
This talk presents a pipeline to create an initial version converting markdown files and html into po files. Using a script to automatic translate them using the cloud and what to do when the document gets updated.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>fq - jq for binary formats</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;fq is inspired by the well known jq tool and language and allows you to work with binary formats the same way you would using jq. In addition it can present data like a hex viewer, transform, slice and concatenate binary data. It also supports nested formats and has an interactive REPL with auto-completion.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It was originally designed to query, inspect and debug media codecs and containers like mp4, flac, mp3, jpeg. But has since then been extended to support a variety of formats like executables, packet captures (with TCP reassembly) and serialization formats like JSON, YAML, XML, ASN1 BER, Avro, CBOR, protobuf. In addition it also has functions to work with URL:s, convert to/from hex, number bases, search for things etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary it aims to be jq, hexdump, dd and gdb for files combined into one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Parsing binary formats with Kaitai Struct</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Binary Tools</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kaitai Struct is a tool for parsing binary formats. Binary formats, such as archive files, executables, filesystems, multimedia files, network protocols, etc. are everywhere. If your application needs to read data in a specific binary format, you need a parser that unpacks the bytes into meaningful data structures that you can work with. There are libraries doing that for popular formats, but what if there is no suitable library in your programming language for the format you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaitai Struct has got you covered: it introduces a declarative domain-specific language (based on YAML) for describing the structure of arbitrary binary formats. Format specifications in this language are consumed by a compiler, which generates ready-to-use parsing modules in 11 programming languages (C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Nim, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby). There are more than 180 format specifications in the format gallery and hundreds more in various GitHub projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the current state, capabilities and limitations of Kaitai Struct. It will also focus on serialization: a highly requested feature that is being actively worked on. Currently, Kaitai Struct can only parse (read) existing binary files created by other applications. Serialization allows to edit the data of an existing file and write it back or create a new file from scratch, greatly expanding the use of all written format specifications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU poke is an interactive, extensible editor for binary data.  Not limited to editing basic entities such as bits and bytes, it provides a full-fledged procedural, interactive programming language designed to describe data structures and to operate on them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this activity we will show the program and discuss about the current status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Stack walking/unwinding without frame pointers</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Binary Tools</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Sampling CPU profilers periodically fetch the stacks of the profiled processes that are running on the CPU at a given time. Walking the stacks of native processes with a little work is easily possible when frame pointers(FPs) are present. But most binaries in the real world are not compiled with FPs. So it can get quite complicated if profilers have to walk the stacks when frame pointers are omitted. In this talk, we will talk about how we can walk the stacks using the DWARF CFI (mainly .eh_frame). We will also discuss how eBPF is helping us with that and how extending the current stack walking facilities can be useful especially in interpreted languages, such as Ruby, as well as runtimes with JITs, like the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU poke is about manipulating structured binary data. For a long time, the only available user interface (UI) for poke was the CLI interface. But that's not the case anymore! Now we have ‘poked’ and a lot of pokelets. ‘poked’ is the daemon responsible for enabling pokelets provide their UIs. This talk explains why this approach is a good and powerful idea and how it enables users to make their own task-specific UIs very fast, or extend GNU poke with more capabilities (like making GNU poke a more powerful Wireshark-like tool, or adding disassembly capabilities). pacme project (a suite of pokelets) and poke-el (an Emacs interface) will be presented as examples.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>7 things I learned about old computers, via emulation</title>
        <subtitle>(p.s. it's not about games)</subtitle>
        <track>Emulator Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For most people, an emulator is a way of running old software (usually games) on new hardware. But using an emulator to step through the original ROM code of an old computer can provide insights on how the machine worked, teaching us tricks that were usually the preserve of hardware hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we cover seven different machines (including perennial home computers like the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, along with the Dragon 32, and consoles like the Gameboy) to deep dive on a single element of their implementation. We explain how data can be transfered without a data bus, why it's quicker to check for multiple results instead of one, or what is the legally optimal series of bytes for copy protection.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a brief overview of the era in question, 1980-1985, we begin by looking at each of the 7 machines, showing an open source emulator, and how it works in a normal scenario. We then highlight a portion of the code to examine, and break down the reasons for it being written in the way it was. For each machine, we focus on the way the code makes the machine work showing a practical use to emulators that is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We end with a number of "honorary mentions" of ROM code that exists for non-essential purposes, such as Easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. no knowledge of antiquated assembly languages is required or expected!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A presentation on Dreamcast and Nintendo DS emulation on PSP. This talk discusses the challenges and obstacles of porting emulators nullDC, nooDS and DeSmuME to PSP, as well as tailoring and optimising them according to the PSP's unique hardware layout. Utilising tools and tricks far beyond what was officially possible on PSP, this will push the hardware to its limit - not for the faint of heart!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Emulating a rival console released in the same year as your platform is no mean feat, nor is emulating a home console released just a few years prior as a handheld. Yet this is exactly what the PSP scene has set out to accomplish, and a few talented developers have spent hours researching these platforms in-depth and re-inventing the emulators to push them as far as possible. They have also delved into techniques never possible under official limitations - executing code directly on the second CPU, previously barred for official software, and using the latest development tools that can far exceed older results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far can we really push the PSP? And can new, experimental techniques claw enough performance to emulate the impossible?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Emulator development in Java</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Emulator Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk explores my recent experience of developing an emulator in Java for two of our favourite Z80-based retro machines, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Sega Master System. At first glance, Java may not seem the obvious choice for emulator development: it lacks features such as unions, macros and definable primitive types (at least until recently!) that are leveraged for efficiency by emulators written in C/C++; integrating with native libraries beyond those in the standard platform can add development complexity and performance considerations; meanwhile, our program runs in a virtual machine whose JIT compiler and garbage collector have the potential to introduce latency into time-critical code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Java is cross-platform and includes sound, graphics, UI and concurrency APIs out of the box and its native platform integration and under-the-hood optimisations have been steadily maturing. We will explore what Java has to offer the emulator developer using “traditional” Java language and standard OpenJDK features alone, and see when and how to address some of our concerns when it comes to low-level data operations and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>OpenCSD, simple and intuitive computational storage emulation with QEMU and eBPF</title>
        <subtitle>After all, why not turn your computer into a distributed system?</subtitle>
        <track>Emulator Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Computational storage devices (or CSDs) are the new emerging technology that allows offloading computation to storage devices. In this technology, computation is pushed to the storage device (close to the data), and only the final result is returned to main system memory. The efficiency and performance gains come from the reduction in data movement over the I/O interconnects, thus relieving pressure on the memory bandwidth in the traditional Von Nuemann architecture where all data is first moved to the main memory before processing. Despite lots of enthusiasm, proposals, and research publications, there are no immediately available open-source ready to use CSDs available. Due to the lack of such prototypes, it is very hard and challenging to explore hardware, physical interfaces, application APIs (block-level, file system, key-value stores) for CSD devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present OpenCSD, a completely open-source CSD exploration platform designed with QEMU. OpenCSD uses eBPF as the means to offload computation to the CSD, and includes an accompanying file system. FluffleFS, the file system, uses POSIX extended attributes to interact with the CSD device. The full, open-source implementation including a block-device, programming toolchain and a file system interface; allow anyone to explore the paradigm of computational storage.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Understanding the Bull GAMMA 3 first generation computer through emulation</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Emulator Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;First generation computers emerged during WW2 and developed in the 1950s and were based on quite different from the present technology: vaccum tubes/germanium diodes for processing and delay lines for memory. Running those ancestors is extremely difficult given the few examplaries left, their delicate technology and the lost expertise. However at a logical level, their architecture is not so different of our current computers as theses ancestors quickly adhered to the then emerging Von Neumann architecture. This allow us to understand their behaviour on programs through emulating their instruction set and memory structure. This talk presents this process applied by the NAM-IP computer museum to revive the memory of the GAMMA 3, the first french computer build and sold by Bull between 1952 and 1962.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After describing the machine structure and some existing emulators (assembly/javascript from ACONIT), we show how to progressively build a JAVA implementation by following the actual machine evolution from a core machine centered on an ALU operating on 7 decimal words and a 64 instruction panel to an enriched instruction set supporting a binary computation mode and external memories, including a magnetic drum of about 100KB. We then demonstrate the result on a few business programs recovered from that era. The talk also reminds about key concepts, the electromecanical context and how the transition proceeded to computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2020 a global pandemic forced us to remain indoors for some time, and in my case, I set to work on finally writing that GameBoy emulator... As a software developer without much of a formal background in computer architecture, this project served as a gentle and playful introduction to the topic (and perhaps it played some role in me eventually going to work with the ARM folks). This presentation is a playback of everything I managed to learn/discover during this process, some anecdotes, live demos, funny-looking glitches, Rust, WebAssembly, and (no promises here) perhaps a FOSDEM-exclusive ROM demo!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Data-in-use encryption has been a long standing open problem for decades. In contrast to data-in-rest encryption, data-in-use encryption guarantees that data remains fully encrypted throughout the runtime, that is while querying, reading or writing into the database. In this talk, we show how data-in-use encryption can be easily realized leveraging confidential compute. The nice thing is, no changes to the code base and devops process are required.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>InnoDB change buffer: Unsafe at any speed</title>
        <subtitle>The tale of some corruption bugs and how they were found</subtitle>
        <track>MariaDB, MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the innovations in InnoDB was the change buffer (originally, insert buffer), which aims to convert random I/O to more sequential I/O, by buffering certain changes to secondary index B-tree leaf pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its design and nature, any bugs related to the change buffer are extremely hard to reproduce. The change buffer is also becoming irrelevant, as the difference between random and sequential I/O is disappearing along with rotational storage (HDDs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the rr debugger and some improvements to InnoDB data structures, we have been able to reproduce and fix several tricky bugs related to the InnoDB change buffer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We shortly explain what the InnoDB change buffer is and how it is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We describe the challenges of testing the change buffer and some bug scenarios at a high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on one example, we show how instead of debugging a core dump and guessing what might have led to the problem, we can use &lt;code&gt;rr replay&lt;/code&gt; to analyze a deterministic execution trace from &lt;code&gt;rr record&lt;/code&gt; leading to the failure. We can set breakpoints and data watchpoints and examine the state of the traced process at any point of time of execution. This even works across process boundaries, for crash recovery bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.10 are the latest Major versions for MySQL and MariaDB.  While MariaDB started by being slightly different MySQL variant,  now it has grown into very much different database platforms which grows more different from every release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will look into the differences between MySQL and MariaDB in the core areas such as SQL features, query optimizations, replication, storage engines, and security. We will also discuss the unique features and capabilities MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.10 offers compared to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL is still hot, with Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) and MariaDB Server. Welcome back post-pandemic to see what is on offer in the current ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Amazon RDS now uses semi-sync replication rather than DRBD for multi-AZ deployments? Did you know that Galera Cluster for MySQL 8 is much more efficient with CLONE SST rather than using the xtrabackup method for SST? Did you know that Percona Server continues to extend MyRocks? Did you know that MariaDB Server has more Oracle syntax compatibility? This and more will be covered in the session, while short and quick, should leave you wandering to discover new features for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come for an &lt;em&gt;unbiased&lt;/em&gt; walk through the servers and what they offer from a feature standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you look at data store as just another service, the things Application cares about is successfully establishing connection and getting results to the queries promptly and with correct results.&lt;br/&gt;
In this presentation, we will explore this seemingly simple aspect of working with MySQL in details. We will talk about why you want to go beyond the averages, and how to group queries together in the meaningful way so you’re not overwhelmed with amount of details but find the right queries to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will answer the question on when you should focus on tuning specific queries or when it is better to focus on tuning the database (or just getting a bigger box).
We will also look at other ways to minimize user facing response time, such as parallel queries, asynchronous queries, queueing complex work, as well as often misunderstood response time killers such as overloaded network, stolen CPU, and even limits imposed by this pesky speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How does schema changes work in a distributed SQL database</subtitle>
        <track>MariaDB, MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Schema changes at scale must keep the data accessible and cannot block any clients from using a table. TiDB, a distributed MySQL compatible database, solves this by transitioning through compatible states, so clients can transition to the new state asynchronously and continue to use the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PingCAP, the developers of TiDB, has evolved the schema changes implementation to be both faster and more tuneable, which will be shown in the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation will explain things like why a delete only state is needed, also how something like REORGANIZE PARTITION can be executed online without blocking. New development like generating and ingesting SST files for speeding up data reorganization for ADD INDEX and distributing the data reorganization load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Life of a Query in Vitess</title>
        <subtitle>Impersonating a monolithic database</subtitle>
        <track>MariaDB, MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Vitess is built on three major pillars: Query Serving, Cluster Management and VReplication. All are critical to the success of running a distributed SQL database. Vitess is composed of various different components that work in harmony to achieve scalability and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we will walk through how Vitess Query Serving works and how it goes through the different stages: from the network protocol, through parsing, planning, and down to execution and session management, finally to provide the query result back to the client. The session also discusses what Vitess has to do to provide the appearance of a single monolithic MySQL even as data is sharded. In the end, we will also touch on how we ensure that Cluster Management and Sharding operations have almost zero impact on the query serving uptime.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Canonical has been relying on the Juju platform for many years. Juju enables anyone to build their own managed services. Now, our goal is to build an open-source managed MySQL solution.
The Canonical Data Platform will enable anyone to easily deploy and manage highly available, self-healing, secure and scalable data systems. Platform users will retain complete governance over their data.
In this talk, we share our vision, current state, and our philosophy around managed databases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ProxySQL is a MySQL protocol aware, high-performance reverse proxy commonly used in MySQL compatible cloud databases. Thanks to these features, ProxySQL offers an extra layer of flexibility and control otherwise very challenging to achieve when designing and adapting your infrastructure to different workloads. In this talk, we aim to discuss how to use these features for being able to lower your required isolation levels and causality checks in a multi-primary Galera cluster, thus attempting to increase the overall performance of the cluster. We will provide concrete examples, benchmarks and extra points on workload adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Extended observability to agentless monitoring on MySQL using ProcFS UDF plugin</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is a fundamental part of a DBA's daily activities. We must understand how the workload uses limited resources such as memory, CPU, and disks. In this talk, we will cover the ProcFS UDF plugin, which is open-source and designed to provide access to the Linux performance counters by running SQL queries against MySQL 8.0.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the Proc FS plugin, we can extend the monitoring capabilities of databases that cannot run a local agent. That is particularly useful for those who are using DBaaS as well as for companies that have separate teams responsible for operating system and database operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;matrixRTC is the world's first decentralised low-delay platform to exchange real-time data between groups of people over Matrix. The Matrix ecosystem is well known for applications such as Instant Messaging, but what if you want to transmit real-time data such as video conferences or sensor data? matrixRTC enables this new set of applications which benefit from low delay and real-time properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we walk through the journey from 1:1 calling towards the powerful matrixRTC framework which powers Element Call, our video conferencing solution. We also took into account scaling and resilience in a decentralised manner. Using those base building blocks, applications such as video/audio rooms, 1:1 calls or Third Room (Matrix’ interpretation of the metaverse) are just a matter of business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will start 10 minutes later than originally scheduled, and was extended by 15 minutes after the talk "Load Testing Matrix Homeservers" was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Element is one OSS module in the Sovereign Workplace (dOZ) together with Univention, Open-Xchange, Nextcloud and Collabora.
To serve individual Business Cases with Element, we are developing widgets and continuously extending the widget API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is going to start 5 minutes earlier than originally scheduled, following the cancellation of the talk "Load Testing Matrix Homeservers"&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will explain shortly the idea and status of the Sovereign Workplace and then show widget examples (BarCamp, Meetings, Polls, Whiteboard).
With the current and future widget API Element can become an application platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will then deep-dive into the API for a bit and show how we use it and what challenges it presents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Why use many SDKs when you can have one? Trixnity is not only cross platform capable, but also suitable for clients, bots, servers, appservices or anything in between (e.g. proxy). This talk shows how this is even possible and what challenges there were to make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk gives a brief introduction why Trixnity has emerged as yet another Matrix SDK. It shows what Trixnity does differently and why. For example, a cache on top of the database was implemented by accident, database transactions are saved asynchronously and timeline events are handled in a special way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With RCS forecasted to grow to 3.8 billion subscribers by 2026 (a 300%+ growth from today's population of 1.2 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/operators-providers/rcs-business-messaging#:~:text=Forecast%20Summary,a%20growth%20of%20over%20200%25."&gt;Juniper Research&lt;/a&gt;), Instant Messaging (IM) in SIP is becoming increasingly more important.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SIP is more than voice and video, it is also Instant Messaging and Presence.  Even if traditional SIP services are more voice-focused, Instant Messaging (IM) has gained a lot of traction in the context of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and Unified Communications (UC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://opensips.org/"&gt;OpenSIPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.opensips.org/About/Version-3-3-0"&gt;latest 3.3 release&lt;/a&gt; introduces several new modules which facilitate the implementation of messaging services in both IMS and UC contexts.  Tune in to this presentation for an in-depth view on the new MSRP stack in OpenSIPS, new MSRP-related modules and other exciting features!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/speaker/razvan_crainea/"&gt;Răzvan Crainea&lt;/a&gt; and Liviu Chircu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This presentation will give a brief overview on how you can build a similar kind of application using the Janus WebRTC Server, by focusing on the broadcasting and scalability aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While it may seem weird to think of WebRTC applications without video, that shouldn't be the case. In fact, the success of podcasts or platforms like Audible  are proof of the fact there's a lot of people definitely interested in consuming content that's only made of audio. When you think of applications like the aforementioned Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces and Reddit Talk, it's clear that the same can be said when there's potential engagement as well, and where the actual conversation becomes more important than any visual aid that may come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think of how one could build a similar application using open source tools, and the Janus WebRTC Server in particular (which as a matter of fact is apparently part of the Twitter Spaces stack itself). Specifically, in the presentation I'll focus mostly on what building blocks you can start from, and how you can build a larger application on top of them in a scalable way (with or without WebRTC as a distribution channel), taking advantage of functionality Janus ships out of the box (like the RTP forwarders that were presented at FOSDEM a couple of years ago), with a few considerations on how the current audio support in WebRTC can be of help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago we added support for 500 participants in Jitsi Meet. Today I'll show you how we are taking that to the next level: 10000 yes, that is 10 thousand participants!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reaching 500 participants was a huge ordeal because it stressed every component in our architecture, from the User Interface all the way to our XMPP server and everything in between. In order to reach 10000 participants thinking outside of the box was necessary. Thanks to some clever tricks like using the visitor role and multiple XMPP MUCs we were able to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will get into the gory details of what it took to get there!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WebRTC was obviously popular with developers during the peaks of the pandemic, but how is it doing now? Did all those new projects die, putting the community back at pre-pandemic “normal” levels or is WebRTC still going strong? Are there many new WebRTC-related repos? Is WebRTC still attracting new users and what are they doing?  How are newer API’s like Insertable Streams, WHIP, and WebCodecs doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Chad Hart of webrtcHacks and Kranky Geek will answer these questions with a fresh analysis based on a review of over a million GitHub events since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How to architect an oncall live payment system in the cloud using Kamailio &amp; RTP Engine.</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Just using OSS, namely kamailio and rtpengine and using a public cloud provider for hosting (it can be anything), we want to share how we have put an oncall live credit card payment system PCI/DSS certified together.
We will also go through the infrastructure parts and networking requirements that show how we also did this to be stateless as possible and horizontal scalable towards anyone's need.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be a company sponsored talk by people that advocate for OSS technology adoption. On the call center industry it is often needed to process payments while on call with customers, Talkdesk is a cloud native contact center solution provider where customers demand such feature for their daily usage.
The talk goal is to show how we at Talkdesk have replaced proprietary resources previously in use, just by OSS namely kamailio &amp;amp; rtpengine and how we have architected a new solution for oncall live credit card payments PCI/DSS certified.
We will go through some of the issues we were having before with a proprietary dependent implementation and on how we replaced it by a totally new solution totally owned by Talkdesk that just replaced the old buggy proprietary based implementation.
We will also share how we made the implementation secure, stateless, scalable PCI/DSS certified also being cloud native.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Dutch government wanted an obligatory standard for chat interoperability in healthcare. I chaired the standardisation workgroup drafting that standard and have learned an awful lot about interoperable chats and about the pitfalls of mixing up policy making and standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the European Commission wants an obligatory standard for chat interoperability, this time because of the ‘Digital Service Act’. Lets have a look what to expect when writing that standard!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sending a text message back and forth is pretty easy to standardise, but there is much more to chat, like avatars, sending pictures, stickers and emoji, message acknowledgment, ‘is typing’ messages, file transfer, end to end encryption and so on. Also some more interesting questions like: should it only be interoperable between some big organisations? Should only the s2s data streams be interoperable or also the c2s traffic? Lots of choices to make, I will draft an agenda for it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Real-time audio/video conferences in Linphone thanks to a modern SFU server</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Real Time Communications</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Existing audio/video conferencing solutions of type “Multipoint control unit” or “Mediamixing mixer”, have proved to be costly in terms of resources in the case of video processing, due to the algorithm complexity of video codecs. This constraint leaded to the emergence of new solutions transmitting a useful subset of the streams received from all the participants, to each participant. For example: only the video of the actively talking participant is dispatched to each participants, together with some very low resolution video streams of the other participants.
This technology is referred to as “Selective Forwarding Unit” (SFU) or “Selective Forwarding Middlebox” (SFM). These solutions open the path to conference sessions managed by a server that does not decode the media content.
The main benefit of a Selective Forwarding Unit is that it is capable of receiving multiple media streams and then decide which of these media streams should be sent to which participant. That way it is technically possible to enhance the number of participants to a group call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linphone is likely to be the first open source SIP-based conferencing solution powered by a modern SFU server. As the server solution already used for Instant Messaging features was already compatible with open standards for the function of managing group chatrooms and their participants., the idea was to enhance this component with media capabilities. Therefore the Linphone team developed a SFU algorithm on top of mediastreamer2 and ortp (Linphone’s media processing libraries), inside of a new software component called “MS-SFU”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compatibility of the conference establishment mechanism with SIP and the RFC 4579 (SIP Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;stream selection performed by the SFU based on the current audio level of participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;implemented standards to allow the communication between the Linphone's library and the Flexisip conference server in SFU mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how this technology paves the way for a future major innovation: end-to-end encryption for real-time audio and video conferences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Scaling Open Source Realtime Messaging System for Millions</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Real-time open source messaging systems are easy to design and code when small, servicing a few hundred users, and with limited media handling features. When an open source project becomes successful, however, the community of users often demand a level of scalability that the original design did not anticipate - and the entire project with its ever increasing codebase  (in both size and complexity)  can fail miserably during this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rocket.Chat as an open source project has to cross the chasm not only once but twice in its history.   The first time we took the wisdom of the time and bolt-on a multi containerized instances approach to the monolith project.  The result is both surprising and somewhat functional - easily servicing 10s of thousands of users. Satisfying the demand at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued success of the project led us to the second transition into a world-scale (approaching hundreds of thousands of users)  rich messaging system.  This transition required a complete re-architecture of the monolith server - an engineering debt that we knew we had to pay before long.  The result, after two long years with a lead R&amp;amp;D team,  is what can be described loosely as a “micro services” based scalable-by-function backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go into some technical details of these two transitions; and fill the community in on a few interesting back stories along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is the 4th edition of the "Status of AMD platforms in coreboot". As usual
the talk will cover the most recent news around the AMD support in open-source
firmware ecosystem and updates of the topics covered in previous years. The
current situation of coreboot project will be disclosed along with new
deprecations and shifting more platforms out of the main tree.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches 2007 where the
first contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's open-source
support continued for many years until now (with some break). Recent coreboot
release enforced new requirements on the features supported by the silicon code
base. More aging AMD platforms kept losing interest and many of them (including
fully open ones) starting to cause unjustifiable overhead, because of
accumulated technical debt. And yet again we experience similar situation as
with the famous 4.11 branch becoming de facto stable branch for some more AMD
platforms (open-source AGESA family14, family15tn, family16kb). Despite the
efforts to keep the platforms in the tree by implementing the necessary
changes, they landed onto the stable 4.18 branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays AMD is releasing the newest AGESA/FSP with the cooperation of hired
coreboot developers. The support covers modern mobile Ryzen chips on Chromebook
devices. We (3mdeb) trying to support the AMD platforms by reimplementing the
ASUS KGPE-D16 (FSF RYF platform) support in coreboot. However, the situation is
growing direr as the maintainership of PC Engines platforms by 3mdeb has
ended. We would like to present Dasharo plan for long term stable and
sustainable support for older platforms. If you are interested in open-source
firmware for most open x86 platforms on the market feel free to tune in and
discuss the ideas with us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Heads - status update!</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Open Source Firmware, BMC and Bootloader</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;h1&gt;What is Heads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heads is a secure runtime environment and a build system; a build recipe cookbook, which boards configurations instructs which modules to be incorporated in the mix needed for specific platform board configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heads takes advantage of the linux kernel and common linux tools to create its runtime environment, including kexec, busybox, whiptail, cryptsetup, flashrom, LVM, the GPG toolstack, and other important and already existing tools to empower its runtime environement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical output of a build are a packed initramfs and kernel, included inside a coreboot ROM image as its payload. Depending on the architecture/chipsets of a platform, it also integrates neutered/deactivated Intel ME/CSME binary blob (platform dependent), generated Gigabit Ethernet (GBE) configuration blob and an unlocked descriptor (IFD). The produced firmware images requires the platform to be flashed once externally to overwrite the origin flash chip(s) content, more specifically to overwrite locked IFD and ME/MCSE regions and to maximize the BIOS region to the extent of liberated Intel ME firmware region. Heads firmware upgrades can then happen internally for the lifetime of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why Heads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heads take advantage of coreboot measured boot in Static Root of Trust (SRTM) mode as a measurement base, which currently measures itself as early as possible, normally from bootblock(or romstage) into TPM a singleregister (PCR2). Heads payload is then executed after measured and extends TPM with its own measurements in distinct PCRs in the goal of sealing secrets in TPM's distinct NV regions. Kernel modules are measured prior to being loaded, LUKS drive(s) headers are measured if a TPM disk encryption key is configured, while going to the Recovery shell invalidates the TPM measurements by the same TPM extend mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a user standpoint, those sealed secrets enables oneself to validate the integrity of the firmware either through TOTP code shown on screen on its smartphone or through HOTP (which challenges validity against supported enabled HOTP USB Security dongles). Another TPM sealed secret enables the user to release an additional LUKS disk encryption key only if the firmware is intact, that kernel modules loaded and Headers are consistent to sealed state and only if provided passphrase matches. Heads also validates user detached signed /boot digests against its fused in rom public key, which guarantees both integrity and authenticity of the trusted boot configuration prior of kexec’ing into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot happened since 2020... Let’s cover current state and where the project is heading!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximized boards vs Legacy boards, or how to dodge blob redistribution legal limitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whiptail/FBWhiptail: one graphical interface (GUI) to rule them all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OEM Factory reset/Re-Ownership wizard upstreamed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QEMU/KVM board configurations with swtpm and USB Security dongle support to ease development/testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;What's next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM2 support on QEMU/KVM and SWTPM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better build system to guarantee reproducible builds based on NixOS if everything goes well...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean room, in ram GPG key generation with backup/restore/USB thumb drive emergency usage capabilities from encrypted LUKS container to restore GPG key material on USB Security dongles upon replacement reception/acquisition later on (No more USB Security dongle strong requirement to use Heads while still highly recommended).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authenticated Heads recovery shell, USB boot and more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally: flash write protection options!

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform chipset locking (only Heads can flash firmware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPI Write protection, permitting to write protect coreboot’s bootblock region (requires external flashing when coreboot version bumps happen under Heads. For the most paranoid only!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International keyboard support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On demand MAC randomization inside of Heads, overwriting GBE region inside of firmware. Persistence across firmware upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Overview of Secure Boot state in the ARM-based SoCs</title>
        <subtitle>2nd edition</subtitle>
        <track>Open Source Firmware, BMC and Bootloader</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the ARM world, Secure Boot is typically a BootROM feature, which allows for verification of the loaded binaries (firmware, bootloader, Linux kernel) before executing it. The main idea is to prevent untrusted code from running on our platform. The general approach is similar across vendors, but this area has no standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 2nd edition of such an overview. During the presentation, we will check the status of the Secure Boot feature on ARM SoCs shown a year ago, and then we will expand this by describing examples on Rockchip and Mediatek based boards. The knowledge contained in this talk should help developers integrate Secure Boot into their platforms, contributing to increased security in the world of embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;TwPM project aims to increase the trustworthiness of the TPM module
(hence the TwPM), by providing the open-source firmware implementation for the
TPM device, compliant to the TCG PC Client Specification.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) enable measured boot and support verified boot,
Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement, and other security features. Currently,
the market is dominated by the TPMs based on chips from large silicon vendors.
The common characteristic of these modules is the proprietary firmware
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will outline the project's goals, design, current challenges,
and status. The goal is also to gather a community around this project
and exchange ideas on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Semihosting U-Boot</title>
        <subtitle>Look, ma, no serial!</subtitle>
        <track>Open Source Firmware, BMC and Bootloader</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Semihosting provides console, filesystem access, and other functions over a debug interface, such as JTAG. This is especially useful when traditional bootstrap interfaces such as serial, USB, or Ethernet are not available in hardware. This talk will discuss implementing improved semihosting support in U-Boot; semihosting's strengths, weaknesses, and how to work around them; and how to semihost U-Boot with OpenOCD on your next board bringup.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Semihosting has long been used to provide host services for embedded ARM systems, especially microcontrollers. However, its use on Linux-capable systems has been much patchier. Vendor-supported recovery modes often use JTAG, but seldom make use of the features provided by semihosting. U-Boot has supported loading files using semihosting on ARM Virtual Express platforms since 2014, but lacked serial support and integration with standard commands. In release 2022.07, such support has been added, motivated by use on QorIQ platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NXP QorIQ platforms require a valid configuration programmed into the boot source in order to boot. Although there is a fallback configuration, it does not support traditional firmware loading interfaces such as USB or Ethernet. By using U-Boot semihosted over JTAG with OpenOCD, a recovery image can be loaded which is sufficient to complete device programming. The same binaries can be used to boot from eMMC as well as JTAG, simplifying configuration. Because semihosting is standard across ARM platforms which support JTAG debugging, similar strategies can be reused whenever JTAG is the most convenient communication method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target audience of this talk includes users of ARM or RISC-V platforms with JTAG Boot; users of U-Boot, OpenOCD, and QEMU; and developers of other bootloaders who are interested in adding semihosting support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Self-Hosting (Almost) All The Way Down</title>
        <subtitle>A FPGA-based Fedora-capable computer that can rebuild its own bitstream</subtitle>
        <track>RISC-V</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I will demonstrate FPGA-based 64-bit RISC-V computer, capable of booting and
running the riscv64 port of Fedora. Using Free/Libre packages available as
part of the Fedora repositories, this machine is capable of recompiling not
only its own software (e.g., kernel, glibc, gcc), but also its own gateware
(i.e., FPGA bitstream), completely from source code, all the way down to (but
not including) the physical (FPGA) silicon.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern hardware development shares many similarities with software: design and
specification in a programmatic hardware description source language (HDL),
and compilation of said sources into either photolitographic masks etched into
silicon for Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), or into
configuration data (bitstream) for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware vulnerabilities (accidental or intentional) can be inserted during any
such lifecycle stages: as part of the design in HDL sources, during compilation
where buggy or malicious toolchains generate malfunctioning designs from clean
HDL sources, or during ASIC fabrication, where masks are altered to etch
backdoors or Trojans directly into the silicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once fabricated, ASICs are difficult, expensive, and impractical to check for
vulnerabilities, which can be as bad as a privilege escalation backdoor
allowing for a total system compromise, even in the absence of any software
exploits available to the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's begin by mitigating against ASIC fabrication-time backdoor insertion by
using soft-IP-core hardware blocks on FPGAs, which are fabricated in the
absence of any knowledge of the final design details, and also consist of a
regular grid of identical, generic configurable blocks -- making it easier to
inspect for defects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having settled on FPGAs for hardware designs requiring enhanced assurance, we
can mitigate against HDL source and toolchain vulnerability insertion by
insisting on openly available sources to both, and on the ability of the system
to be self-hosting, i.e., to rebuild everything, from source, without relying
on assistance from any external "black box" or proprietary components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will demonstrate a Fedora capable RISC-V computer based on the Rocket CPU,
using LiteX for the rest of its chipset, deployed on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA board,
with the bitstream generated from sources by a fully Free/Libre toolchain
consisting of Yosys, Trellis, and NextPnR. Most importantly, the computer will
be capable of (slowly) rebuilding its own bitstream, by being capable of
directly executing the Yosys/Trellis/NextPnR toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;QtRvSim is a graphical RISC-V microprocessor simulator developed to aid computer architecture understanding. It is designed to cover the track of an undergraduate course based on the book "Computer Organization and Design" by Patterson and Hennessy. The class can begin with a single-cycle microarchitecture and gradually add more complex features like pipeline, hazard unit (with or without forward paths), configurable data and instruction cache, emulation of basic system calls, and finally, memory-mapped peripherals. The simulator provides an editor with an integrated assembler. The online version and course materials are available at &lt;a href="https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/"&gt;https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The simulator is cycle-accurate (memory operations finish within one cycle), compliant with official RISC-V tests, and supports RV32IM, RV64IM (CLI-only), and Zicsr.
Featured peripherals are LEDs, knobs with buttons, a terminal, and an LCD display.
It is available for Linux, Windows, macOS, and WebAssembly and is developed on &lt;a href="https://github.com/cvut/qtrvsim"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Many course materials, recordings, and edited lecture videos are also freely available at &lt;a href="https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/"&gt;comparch.edu.cvut.cz&lt;/a&gt;.
Czech Technical University in Prague, Technical University in Graz, and the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs are currently employing QtRVSim in their classes. Our previous MIPS edition (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cvut/qtmips"&gt;QtMips&lt;/a&gt;) is used by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and Charles University in Prague.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Porting RISC-V to GNU Guix</title>
        <subtitle>A year in review</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix is a from-source distribution with binary substitutes available. It is also a functional package manager, meaning that all the inputs are hashed and the build results are placed in their own destination folder. Guix also does its best to minimize bootstrap seeds, instead relying on a few cross-compiled bootstrap binaries used to build all other packages on the system. This provides some interesting bootstrap issues, especially for newer architectures, as we need to recreate the bootstrap path as it may have existed years ago in order to support programming languages. Some languages, like nodejs or ocaml, need to have support backported only a few versions. Others like java need more than a decade. Rust needed to use an alternate implementation of rustc to be bootstrapped and Haskell currently isn't on the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How to add an GCC builtin to the RISC-V compiler</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>RISC-V</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many low level features of architectures are implemented in GCC as builtin functions. Builtin functions look superficially like any C function, but are in fact intrinsic to the compiler and represented as patterns to be matched in the machine description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Builtin functions are often used to access unique functionality of individual machine instructions. Being integrated within the compiler, they are more efficient than using simple inline assembly code. For RISC-V, they offer an excellent way to expose the functionality of instruction set extensions to the C/C++ programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a builtin function to GCC is not that difficult, but neither is it completely trivial.  In this talk we will show you how to add builtin functions using examples from the OpenHW Group's CV32E40Pv2 processor core.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Bringing up the OpenHW Group RISC-V tool chains</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>RISC-V</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Open Hardware Group (https://www.openhwgroup.org/) is a large industry/academic consortium developing a family of fully open source, commercial grade RISC-V cores, branded as CORE-V. These are supported by a full software ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will look at the challenges of developing a vendor specific software ecosystem, how this ecosystem relates to the official upstream projects, and particularly the technical challenges in developing, maintaining and upstreaming vendor specific software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although CORE-V is a completely standard RISC-V architecture, it supports a large number of custom ISA extensions, and it is the support of these extensions that creates most of the challenge.  Many of these extensions come from the PULP research group at ETH Zürich, but some are pre-freeze versions of what will become standard RISC-V extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upstream projects generally provide mechanisms to support vendor specific variants, for example by use of the vendor field in the target triplet.  Thus rather than the generic riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc compiler, we can have the riscv32-corev-elf-gcc compiler. However this requires modifications to the code to use this information to control when CORE-V specific functionality is to be enabled, and this talk will explore these. In one specific case (vendor specific relocations), we are waiting on standardization from the RISC-V psabi committee, but otherwise this is all using well proven existing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work has also served to expose gaps in the upstream projects. For example, while versioning of ISA extensions is standardized, the code base for the GNU assembler lacks the infrastructure to handle this.  Similarly many ISA extensions require builtin (intrinsic) function support, but the upstream tools have only a handful of builtin functions, and the infrastructure for RISC-V builtins is very small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk cannot cover detail of every tool and operating system being developed, so will concentrate particularly on the CORE-V GCC tool chain.  However we will draw parallels with the work going on in CORE-V specific simulators and in CORE-V specific operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most CISOs and a great majority of developers are not aware of the importance of encrypting data in use (the core idea behind Confidential Computing). Confidential Computing is evolving rapidly and is starting to gain adoption by CSPs, but user adoption is still slow. But what if encrypting data in use became the default way to deploy applications, both in the Cloud and even on premises? In this session, we’ll discuss what are the main roadblocks towards this vision, what we can do about it, and what are the main implications if encrypting data in use becomes the norm.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three states in which data can be protected: at rest, in transit, and in use. Encrypting data at rest (e.g. files, objects, storage) and in transit (e.g. TLS, HTTPS) have become a common practice, while encrypting data in use (the core idea behind Confidential Computing) is still an emerging concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while a common practice today, encrypting data in transit only gained wide adoption with the Let’s Encrypt movement, which was fundamental in changing the general mindset from “encryption is only important for e-commerce and banking applications” to “let’s encrypt everything by default, no matter what’s the application”. Confidential Computing is just starting to emerge, and most use cases are restricted to sectors like healthcare and banking, which require greater assurances that their sensitive code and data are protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look back at the Let's Encrypt project, which started 10 years, to understand why this movement was so successful and how we can replicate this success for encrypting data in use. Our hope is to make encrypting data in use the default way for deploying applications, which will fundamentally change the security approach that exists today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>LSKV: Democratising Confidential Computing from the Core</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Distributed datastores such as etcd are widespread, particularly in the world of orchestration. They support the core of services like Kubernetes, providing storage for and access to critical data. These orchestration platforms are being increasingly run in the cloud but the core datastores don’t support natively running in confidential environments, despite the critical data they store. The ‘lift-and-shift’ approach leaves changes to be made to fully leverage the confidential computing context, making it unsuitable. On the other hand, native confidential applications can be difficult to build from scratch, hence the development of frameworks such as CCF which provide small-TCB building blocks for distributed services. LSKV, the Ledger-backed Secure Key-Value store, is built on top of CCF and provides a familiar etcd API, being able to seamlessly slot into existing systems. It keeps cloud operators out of the trust boundary and makes governance operations publicly available to audit on a ledger.­­­­­ LSKV aims to democratise confidential computing, lowering the barrier to entry and making it available to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Keeping safety-critical programs alive when Linux isn’t able to</title>
        <subtitle>Using OP-TEE to deliver availability to applications in a Trusted Execution Environment.</subtitle>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, industry is using Linux on embedded systems to take advantage of its flexibility and existing (open source) functionality. This allows them to connect Cyber-Physical Systems, which have stringent safety requirements, to the Internet so that they can do remote management and monitoring. However, the flip side of the flexibility coin is decreased availability. Not only can a lot more go wrong in such a complex operating system, if an attacker would be able to get root access on such systems, all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research project makes use of hardware Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), now readily available on even low-end commodity devices, to provide a secure and always available execution context for safety-critical programs. By integrating a real-time scheduler inside of OP-TEE OS running in an Arm TrustZone TEE, it is possible to safeguard the real-time execution requirements of these programs, even under the influence of Linux kernel panics and remote attackers with root privileges. This presentation will explain the system architecture that resulted from our research, its implementation on a common Arm processor and a quick demo showcasing the core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Standing on the shoulders of the TDX and SEV giants, the RISC-V &lt;a href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-ap-tee/"&gt;AP-TEE Technical Group&lt;/a&gt; is currently defining the threat-model, the reference architecture and the interfaces to support confidential computing use cases on RISC-V. All the TG discussions happen in the open and all the related reference implementations are open source, representing a unique opportunity for interested contributors to participate in the elaboration of such a fundamental piece of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this presentation we will describe the currently proposed architecture, highlighting how it is focusing on multi-tenant, hardware-virtualized workloads. We will also explain how both the guest and host APIs will support this architecture by stepping through a few concrete confidential computing use cases. Next we will present &lt;a href="https://github.com/rivosinc/salus/"&gt;Salus&lt;/a&gt;, the reference Trusted Security Manager (TSM) implementation. The last part of this talk will go into the short and longer term tasks the TG is going to tackle, like e.g. trusted IO and attestation. During this last section, we will try to highlight where and how new contributors could help the RISC-V community design and implement this confidential computing architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;IBM Z (s390x) has been supporting confidential virtual machines for a few years now. It is a Linux-first feature, fully supported by KVM and Qemu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will introduce the technology, the architectural extensions, the typical lifecycle of host and guest, the
unique features, and how KVM and Qemu have been adapted to support it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the interesting and unique features covered in the presentation are:
* allowing for swapping guest memory in the host
* not requiring encryption of guest memory when running
* implicit attestation
* explicit attestation
* secure dumps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lifecycle of a secure guest will be presented including all interactions among the guest, the host, the trusted hardware/firmware (Ultravisor), and the attestation agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tilting a Pyramid</title>
        <subtitle>Confidentiality in a Cloud Native Environment</subtitle>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A presentation about implications and headaches we're facing when we want to provide Confidentiality in a Cloud Native Environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has been transformative not onlyfrom the technical point of view, but also by introducing processes that democratized dealing with infrascture to some degree. To Enable developers to deploy their workloads independently required segmenting responsibilities of operating and using the cluster. The personas of Cluster Admin and API Users (and various shades in this spectrum) have been introduced to ensure teams can collaborate in a shared compute environment in safe and reliable manner. A multitude of extensions, tooling and processes have been introduced to protect a Kubernetes environment from malicious or erronous workloads (supply chain security).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, typically this model is still very much hierarchical: Cloud Service Providers (CSP) serve compute and control plane components which are then administered By Cluster Operators (CO) who configure the security and compliance boundaries in which Users can operate. Confidential Computing is challenging this model. The notion of rusted execution environments and trusted parties, which may exclude the CO and most likely the CSP turns a rigid pyramid of privileges into a more messy, bi-directional picture. We want to discuss some of the conceptual and technical challenges that we currently identifiy for Confidential Computing in a Cloud Native environment and review ongoing, practical efforts to reconcile both domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Salmiac: Running unmodified container images in Nitro Enclaves</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AWS Nitro is a confidential computing technology from Amazon that provides highly isolated execution environments in EC2 instances. Absence of external networking, persistent storage and interaction with the enclave reduces the attack surface. However, this drastically limits the number of useful applications that can run on a Nitro platform. Salmiac developed by Fortanix aims at solving this problem securely, by extending Nitro enclaves with external networking and persistent filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we discuss the implementation of file system and networking in Salmiac for the AWS Nitro platform in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An AWS Nitro enclave represents a separate VM with it's own processor cores, memory and a running OS kernel. External networking and storage are not available by default inside an enclave. The only way an enclave can communicate with the outside world is through a vsock connection to the parent VM. Salmiac provides network access to the applications inside an enclave by proxying network packages over this vsock connection. Offering secure persistent storage to nitro enclaves is more challenging. Salmiac saves the state of the application in a network block device. Data is transferred into the device via the vsock network channel that connects the enclave and parent in a nitro instance. It is secured by utilizing the Linux kernel's Device Mapper features like dm-verity and dm-crypt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Autonomous Confidential Kubernetes</title>
        <subtitle>How to securely manage K8s from within K8s</subtitle>
        <track>Confidential Computing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Managed Kubernetes offerings deliver a great set of features [autoscaling, loadbalancing, introspection, backups, automatic updates]. Applying the Confidential Computing concept to entire Kubernetes clusters ensures always-encrypted data and eliminates the service provider's access but also contradicts the managed approach. Fully isolated and self-managed clusters provide maximum control and privacy but do not offer smart features out of the box. This results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. We present a Kubernetes-native approach, allowing a cluster to manage itself while offering many features known from fully managed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution comes in the form of open-source microservices that provide secure and autonomous joining of new nodes, autoscaling, failsafe node OS updates, and even Kubernetes upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk covers microservice design patterns that give control back to the Kubernetes administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we explain how remote attestation can help our system to verify each software component of a Kubernetes node during the bootstrapping process, adding that extra level of security to an autonomous architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we explain how you can securely automate the Kubernetes node lifecycle: How nodes can prove their integrity and can join Kubernetes clusters autonomously without relying on a trusted third party to mediate the process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2017 I spoke at FOSDEM and told everyone about how Containerised App technologies like AppImage, Snap, and Flatpak were all terrible and posed the question "What could go wrong?" if we introduced them.
Now, in 2022, I am building a Desktop Linux distribution that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; uses Flatpaks for it's Apps, so obviously, something went horrifically wrong, but not with Flatpaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will revisit some of my arguments from 2017, and discuss how the Flatpak team in particular embraced and addressed those concerns. It will also revisit the arguments advocating for traditional packaging and how they increasingly fall down when compared to the Flatpak way of doing things. That said, this session will try to present a balanced argument, and highlight the risks and responsibilities this approach requires and how some of the containerised app technologies still fail to meet those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conclusion, this session will present a vision for more distribution and packaging projects to follow, possibly narrowing the scope of their efforts to better collaborate and embrace the potential on this new way of getting FOSS software in the hands of users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Automating a rolling binary release for Spack</title>
        <subtitle>Scaling a modern CI workflow to a large distribution</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Spack is a software distribution targeted at HPC systems, with over 6,800 packages.  While Spack has long been a source-only distribution, in June 2022 we added public build caches that offer fixed and rolling binary releases. With 400-500 pull requests per month, most of them package updates, this was a non-trivial task. The build cache model for Spack is similar to Nix and  Guix — it assumes no ABI compatibility. Any change to dependencies triggers rebuilds of dependents. Despite these challenges we have been able to build a CI system that builds and tests packages on pull request and on release branches for a subset of several thousand builds for x86_64, Power, and aarch64, as well as for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and Intel's oneapi compiler.  This talk will cover some of the main challenges we have faced: reliable build infrastructure, integration with pull request workflows, Kubernetes auto-scaling and AWS instance selection, and optimizing build performance in the cloud.  We’ll talk about the infrastructure, as well as the algorithmic complexities of choosing CI commits carefully to minimize builds.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is targeted at distribution maintainers, particularly people managing build farms for large distributions.  The goal of the presentation is to highlight the challenges of managing a rolling release for continuously evolving distributions hosted on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spack manages 400-500 pull requests/month and is a very active repository.  Keeping all the builds working all the time, particularly in a build-from-source system where the recipes are templated, is a big challenge.  We may have the same package built many different ways in Spack (e.g. for different CPUs, GPUs, or MPI implementations), and all of those are managed by the same recipe and a very smart dependency/package configuration resolver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover how we’ve scaled build caching to manage PRs as well as release branches, and how we’ve set up infrastructure that allows us to request builders with specific processor microarchitectures.  The CI system is orchestrated by a high availability GitLab CI instance in the cloud. Builds are automated and triggered by pull requests, with runners both in the cloud and on bare metal.  We will talk about the architecture of the CI system, from the user-facing stack descriptions in YAML to backend services like Kubernetes, Karpenter, S3, CloudFront, and the challenges of tuning runners to give good build performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll also cover a bit about security in a completely PR-driven CI system.  Specifically, we cover how we guarantee that arbitrary public CI users can’t inject malicious code into our binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing commits to build from the distribution tree has been a challenge as well, and in a build-cached system, choosing the right commit to &lt;em&gt;merge&lt;/em&gt; a PR with can be a key factor in minimizing the number of builds that need to be done.  Specifically, we are trying to maximize &lt;em&gt;reuse&lt;/em&gt; of builds done on the rolling release branch while still allowing PRs to update frequently.  Orchestrating this in CI, particularly when most systems want to merge with the head of the mainline, can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll talk about some of the architectural decisions in Spack itself that had to change to better support CI — specifically with the dependency resolver and how we choose exactly which stack configurations to build in CI for the rolling release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this topics should help distribution managers better orchestrate build farms, and they should be particularly relevant to other distributions that are similar to Spack, like Nix and Guix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Debian Janitor is a project to automate the making of certain changes to Debian packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to automate operations that can be taken care of by software, and leave tasks that can't be to developers. The project started sending out pull requests at the end of 2019; since then, close to 20,000 automated changes have been merged or pushed to packaging repositories. The changes made by the system vary from fixing common typos to importing new upstream releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the architecture of the Janitor and its philosophy. One of the key challenges is for it to ensure that changes are correct and a net contribution to Debian, rather than another source of noise.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Debian, openSUSE and Fedora have founded together the Linux Distributions Working Group at the Open Mainframe Project for achieving better support for the mainframe architecture s390x and collaboration for providing solutions.
That has been such success, that SUSE, Red Hat, Canonical (Ubuntu), AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux have joint also. The question has poppeed up, whether we should be restrictly open only for all Linux Distributions or should we include also important upstream projects in our Linux Distributions Working Group. In this presentation we will represent the existing benetif for all Linux distributions and go into detail, which (base) upstream projects should be included/invited and why. Finally, we want to receive feedback during the Q&amp;amp;A session with a discussion, how we should proceed with this idea.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AMENDMENT Linux Distributions’ State of Gaming</title>
        <subtitle>A Case Study of Fedora Workstation</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Due to the constant development of GNU/Linux distributions, setting up video game environments on GNU/Linux has become easier than ever, albeit with some performance and usability drawbacks. This has been further catalyzed by the involvement of popular companies like Valve preferring to use GNU/Linux distributions as their platform of choice for their consoles. We want to delve deep into the state of gaming on these GNU/Linux distributions, using the case study of Fedora Workstation 37, and compare them with other popular operating systems using impartial benchmarking studies. Based on the comprehensive observations, we would further explore how communities can come together to build better GNU/Linux distributions (and software applications surrounding it) to cater to both, video gaming enthusiasts and developers, alike.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Target audience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux distribution maintainers interested in catering to video gaming uses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software application developers who maintain videogaming supporting applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package maintainers who help maintain distribution-specific application packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budding community members wanting to start contributing to the projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux distribution users who are on the fence, about gaming on their OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Benefits to the target audience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux distribution maintainers would be informed about the possible inclusions that can help cater to the users who play and/or develop videogames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software application developers would garner visibility/attention, understand the current advantages and possible improvements, and possibly get contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package maintainers would get to know about support applications requiring packaging and understand how they can create distribution-agnostic solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budding community members would be informed about the upstream projects that help bring GNU/Linux videogaming forward and can use their valued contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU/Linux distribution users would get more information that would help them decide if they should use their operating system for videogaming or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This talk replaces "Modularity, ALP and the dream of the modular-distribution" that was due to have been given by Dan Čermák, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend as he has fallen ill.  We wish him a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the space of a year the Fedora installer Web UI turned from an idea to first preview of installation media being published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still a long way ahead before the new Web-based UI can replace the existing GTK3-powered graphical interface of the Anaconda installer in Fedora. Still it is a good time to talk about reasons for starting the Web UI effort, the technology being used, our progress so far, the challenges encountered &amp;amp; what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is where RHEL development happens in public. You can preview content coming to RHEL, test your things on top of it, and even participate! We'll show you how it works, highlight the key differences between Fedora ELN, CentOS Stream and RHEL, and see where it's all happening.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While showing some level of technical detail, this talk will be high-level, intended for anyone curious about Linux distributions. You'll learn about possible use cases of CentOS Stream, about how code flows into RHEL starting with Fedora, and how you can potentially influence goes into RHEL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;BPF is a rapidly growing technology that allows executing code in a safe environment inside the Linux kernel. Packaging the software makes it available to the broader public of Linux users. In this talk we will discuss how BPF software can be packaged for Linux distributions and Gentoo Linux specifically. We will also discuss some challenges that distribution packagers face when dealing with BPF software and how it is possible to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This session will review the history of women’s contributions to Linux distributions and open source, how Linux communities are a catalyst for improving tech diversity, and what we can continue to improve to bring in the next generation of women FOSS contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This session will review the history of women’s contributions to Linux distributions and open source, how Linux communities are a catalyst for improving tech diversity, and what we can continue to improve to bring in the next generation of women FOSS contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux distributions are a hub for technical excellence and open source innovation. Most people think of our efforts around packaging, integrating new technologies in our distros, and building communities around what we do. But how our communities innovate goes beyond technology alone. There is also innovation around diversity and inclusion in our communities. For women, Linux distro communities can provide a place to learn about open source, start building a career, and growing their professional networks. The goal of this session is to call out women’s contributions in this space, highlight ongoing progress to make Linux communities more inclusive, and a wish list of things our communities could improve so the diversity of our community increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future's looking bright for women who aspire to leave their mark in the world of Open Source. Let’s look at their contributions in distributions and FOSS spaces as we move at light speed from on-prem to cloud to edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fixing Year 2038</title>
        <subtitle>Coordinating the 64-bit time_t ABI migration</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The wrap of 32-bit time_t in Jan 2038 is only 15 years away. The people designing 32-bit linux products/systems still likely to be in use then have long product cycles so fixing this has become quite urgent. The base work has been done, but how to manage this ABI transition in distro-world needs some research, planning and co-ordination amongst distros. This session intends to get feedback on the problem and help inform a plan.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The fundamental choice is whether to treat it is a new arch/ABI/triplet or to migrate within the existing 32-bit arches/triplets to the new ABI. If different distros take different paths here we could end up in very confusing place. Updating ABIs has happened before so it is possible, but time_t appears in a lot of places and such a migration is certainly tricky. It may not be practical for some binary distros. Rebuilding from scratch is simpler but definitely requires a new GNU triplet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various people have looked into this over the last 3 years, but no one person has a good overview. Exactly how difficult this transition is still needs some experimentation and research. FOSDEM is a good opportunity to see where we are at, and see if we are agreed on a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When building and distributing packages and binaries you preferably don't want them to take up gigabytes of space on the disk. Stripping debug information from these distributed binaries are one way of saving a lot of space, but makes debugging crashing applications had. Debug packages collects the stripped information into separate packages which can be installed to provide the necessary information to debug crashing application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arch Linux implemented support for debug packages in 2022, and in this presentation we will take a look at the improvements that was made to the pacman package manager, the infrastructure changes that was needed and how debug packages are distributed through debuginfod.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>KDLP: Kernel Development Learning Pipeline</title>
        <subtitle>A comprehensive pipeline for bringing new talent into the the Linux kernel and its orbit</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;KDLP is a novel program run by Red Hat engineers to address the industry-wide shortage of qualified entry-level candidates for low-level software engineering jobs in general, and the Linux kernel in particular. We created, developed, and teach an "Introduction to Linux Kernel" development course to University of Massachusetts Lowell students and anyone who is interested. We recruit qualified students from our class to internship programs within Red Hat, and we promote the best interns to hiring managers with the aim of bringing them into the industry as full time software engineers. We have pulled together this program from scratch over the past few years, iterating our program and curriculum design in order to stand the program on its feet. As an established program, we plan to continue to scale our program and strengthen our partnerships, including a recent one with the Linux Foundation, in order to bring Linux kernel and low-level software engineering education to a larger audience and global talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A spectre is haunting the Linux kernel... the spectre of time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the industry, we have observed a shortage of qualified entry-level software engineers focused on the low-level niche, and especially within the sub-niche of the Linux kernel. As young, novice software engineers, we noticed this problem, and we quickly became aware that we were far from the only ones to do so. Engineers and managers of all levels within our industry niche have observed -- both privately and publicly -- that we must bring new talent into these spaces, and we must do so urgently. We have seen firsthand among the many talented and experienced engineers firsthand and we have benefited greatly from their guidance and mentorship, but we know that this opportunity will not last forever. Time spares no one, not even the engineers from the days of Digital Equipment Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have come to understand the invaluable and non-quantifiable nature of the tribal knowledge that exists distributed among the great engineers of our industry, and we believe that we must act quickly to enable them to pass on the torch, to strengthen the next link of the great chain of our relatively young but quickly maturing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this understanding, we have created the Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a program to bridge the gaps between academia and industry, between the novice and the legend, between the past and the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AMENDMENT KubeOS: Container OS based on OpenEuler</title>
        <subtitle>A container operating system based on openEuler and a solution of cluster nodes upgrade</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;KubeOS is a lightweight operating system developed in the openEuler community for running containers and Kubernetes. This takl will introduce the KubeOS's OS image and Kubernetes cluster node upgrade solution and how to use KubeOS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With widespread use of containers and Kubernetes, there are fewer requirements for operating systems. In addition, traditional operating systems maybe bring various problems like security, O&amp;amp;M overhead, and OS version splitting problems. This talk will discuss the current problems faced by OS management and upgrade and the concept of Container operating system. Then, share the design ideas and solutions of the container operating system KubeOS. Finally, introduce the architecture, functions, and use of KubeOS in detail.
This talk is likely to be interesting to the O&amp;amp;M personnel, the system administrator, or anyone interested in how the OS of a cluster node becomes a cluster component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was amended on 3 February 2023 to swap the speakers, as the original speaker was unable to attend FOSDEM due to visa issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what might be the best data type for a certain use case? Is it better to use INTEGER or BIGINT, and should you use TIMESTAMP or is it better to use TIMESTAMPTZ? When is the last time you migrated a legacy database and wondered what to use as replacement for VARCHAR2 or CHAR(255)? How to store IP addresses or geographical data, does that fit into VARCHAR or is there something more suitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 15 comes with around 40 different data types preinstalled. This talk looks beyond INTEGER and VARCHAR and dives into some of the lesser known PostgreSQL data types. Use cases and examples show which data type is a good fit for a certain situation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the sayings about development in the Postgres world is “it’s not just open source, it’s open engineering.” In the spirit of openness, this talk will show you how to increase the impact and the reach of your Postgres blog posts. These best practices begin with empathy for your readers—and cover lots of ground from there, including key things to know about SEO, as well as tips on how to promote your blog post. This talk is an updated version of the PGConf EU 2022 talk I gave in Berlin and it's not just theory: real-world examples are included throughout the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will cover what design choices of Go can help you to build robust programs. But also, we will reveal some parts of the language and drivers that can cause obstacles and what routines to apply to avoid risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will try to build the simplest cross-platform application in Go fully covered by tests and ready for CI/CD using GitHub Actions as an example.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AMENDMENT The Human Factor:  Why Database teams Need Crew Resource Management</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>PostgreSQL</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Our industry talks a great deal about human error, with the idea that we can automate away human mistakes. However, we are generally missing a fundamental and technical model of how we as humans operate, and what can be done to minimize errors and maximize good outcomes. As much as "human error" sometimes gets us into problems, the human factor is the only thing that gets us out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as an industry, we do not have to figure this out all by ourselves. Medicine, rail operators, and most importantly, airlines have been on the forefront of research and training in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation you will learn:
- The history of Crew Resource Management
- Specific case-based examples on how database teams suffer the same problems that flight crews, fire crews, and medical teams face
- What crew resource management training teaches
- How to Implement Crew Resource Management in your teams or company
- How Crew Resource Management training delivers benefits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker offers no commercial services in this field but has been involved in implementing crew resource management programs in database teams.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk replaces the talk "SQL vs NoSQL? Get the Best of Both Worlds with JSON in PostgreSQL" by Shayon Sanyal, who unfortunately can't attend FOSDEM this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Bulk Inserts With PostgreSQL: Four Methods For Efficient Data Loading</title>

        <track>PostgreSQL</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a world where data continues to grow at an overwhelming rate, knowing how to load and insert data into PostgreSQL as efficiently as possible is a key skill for any software or data engineer. Whether loading data from files, manually generating multi-valued INSERT or UPSERT statements, or using some of the more popular language SDKs, knowing which option is right for each situation can sometimes be difficult to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will review how to efficiently insert large amounts of data into PostgreSQL using freely available tools and well-crafted SQL. We'll demonstrate the usage of tools like COPY, how to batch data using multi-valued INSERT statements, functions to look for in language SDKs, and even demonstrate how to use array parameters to speed up multi-valued inserts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this session, you will know at least four ways to insert bulk data, the impact it will have on your PostgreSQL database, and options for improving your current application code to perform at its best!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>DBA Evolution (the Changing Role of the Database Administrator)</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever find yourself pondering life’s important questions: What does a DBA actually do? How has the role changed over the years? What will it look like in the future? Why are DBAs so grumpy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shocked me to realise recently that it’s almost a quarter of a century since I started work as a junior database administrator, fresh out of university. Just like everything else in the IT world, the role of the DBA has evolved massively in that time. Has it changed beyond recognition, or does today’s DBA still do fundamentally the same job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t imagine most DBAs currently spend their time reorganising their datafiles to create contiguous blocks of free space that the database can make use of. And I’m fairly certain the world is a better place for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 21 year-old self could never have imagined managing a self-healing, automated, scalable database cluster on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the questions of data modelling, disk capacity, query performance, and user management are as relevant today as they were back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a light-hearted look at the changing role of the DBA over the past couple of decades, with some guesses about what the DBA of the future will be doing. Or will autonomous databases finally have put us all out of work?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you look at data store as just another service, the things Application cares about is successfully establishing connection and getting results to the queries promptly and with correct results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will explore this seemingly simple aspect of working with PostgreSQL in details. We will talk about why you want to go beyond the averages, and how to group queries together in the meaningful way so you’re not overwhelmed with amount of details but find the right queries to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will answer the question on when you should focus on tuning specific queries or when it is better to focus on tuning the database (or just getting a bigger box).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also look at other ways to minimize user facing response time, such as parallel queries, asynchronous queries, queueing complex work, as well as often misunderstood response time killers such as overloaded network, stolen CPU, and even limits imposed by this pesky speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Based on the legendary "Don't Do This" PostgreSQL wiki page, this talk will explore some of the common pitfalls and misconceptions that Postgres users can face - and show possible ways to undo them or workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics to be covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct types for data storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Sub-)Partitioning

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And how to get it wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad SQL habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table inheritance

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And how to undo it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security issues

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsafe configurations and usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connections

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of, and properly handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Capabilities are tokens of authority that are unforgeable and delegable.
The Morello architecture extends the Armv8.2-A profile with features that implement the CHERI capabilities and protection model. It implements 129-bit CHERI capabilities with compressed bounds, which provide a compromise between memory consumption and bounds precision.
The Morello architecture also inherits the rules for architectural features and extensions from Armv8.2-A.
There is ongoing work on Linux kernel support with fine-grained memory protection and scalable compartmentalization features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses how Morello hardware features introduce new opportunities for designing kernel abstractions to achieve intra-kernel privilege separation and sandboxing mechanisms.
We further explain our ongoing work on hardening the kernel's security-sensitive subsystems and some of the challenges to achieving proper security across different abstraction layers in a monolithic kernel.
We hope this talk opens essential discussions with the Linux kernel community to improve hardware-assisted hardening mechanisms within the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There is quite a good chance that you have a PWM in your pocket: A PWM is the hardware unit drives the dimmable backlight for your phone's touch display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's just about emitting a periodic signal out of a single hardware pin, there is a surprising variance in the way different hardware implement a PWM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief introduction about what a PWM actually is and the common use cases the talk demonstrates the challenges of the PWM framework by presenting a few different hardware implementations and showing how the kernel's PWM API covers the whole zoo of PWM implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk concludes with an outlook on plans to further develop the API to be able to cover more use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience learns the general concept of PWMs, about the corner cases in their usage and driver design, and how to avoid the common pitfalls often pointed out to authors of new PWM drivers during the review process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The battle between user space networking and kernel networking has been ongoing since the dawn of high performance Data Plane Frameworks in 2010. With the transition of networking applications to the cloud-native paradigm, developers have had to weigh the benefits of flexibility vs. performance for their applications, and sacrifice one of these attributes for the other at a significant cost. Due to the latest innovations with eBPF, AF_XDP and Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP), there is a unique opportunity to develop a hybrid networking stack that leverages the best of both worlds (kernel smarts and user space performance). As such, developers no longer need to pick one attribute over the other. This Demo will showcase a CNDP-FRR vRouter an example of a hybrid network stack!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we deep dive our path into achieving host networking performance characteristics for containers and Kubernetes Pods. As part of that we developed a veth driver replacement called meta devices which can be made programmable through eBPF. We outline the design of this driver, benchmarks with flamegraph comparison and next steps for upstreaming.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>MPTCP in the upstream kernel</title>
        <subtitle>A long road that started almost 15 years ago</subtitle>
        <track>Kernel</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support in the Linux kernel has started in v5.6. At that time, only a single path could be used. The MPTCP development community has steadily expanded from the initial baseline feature set to now support a broad range of MPTCP features on the wire and through the socket and generic Netlink APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of MPTCP will be presented with an explanation of what is possible today in the Linux kernel and what should come next. The development of MPTCP in the Linux kernel is particular and has not been directly available on a vanilla kernel. Indeed, after 10 years of experimentations on the side -- in an Open-Source "out-of-tree" kernel -- the implementation has been rewritten (almost) from scratch to get an "upstreamable" result that is still being improved today. On the other hand, the out-of-tree kernel was and is still used today in production on large deployments with million of users. Maintaining this out of tree kernel with more than 21k modified lines for each different LTS version has a cost and also introduce some risks and complex situations that are interesting to share.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;MPTCP development for the Linux kernel and mptcpd are public and open. You can find us at &lt;a href="https://mptcp.dev"&gt;mptcp.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Understanding scheduler behavior can be important for understanding application performance.  In this talk, we present some tools that we have developed to help understand scheduling behavior on highly multicore machines.  The tools to be presented enable 1) obtaining a graph showing what tasks are running on what cores, with a variety of coloring schemes, 2) detecting overload situations, and 3) stepping through a recorded execution.  All tools rely on traces collected using trace-cmd.  The tools make it possible to get an overview of the execution, as well as to study specific execution intervals.  The source code is available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/schedgraph/schedgraph.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Implementing profilers and tracers in BPF offers a high degree of flexibility and allows for tools that have lower overhead and can make them suitable for production usage. BPF has a helper to unwind native stacks with frame pointers that works great. Unfortunately, most Linux distros and compilation pipelines omit frame pointers. We've built a BPF program that uses DWARF-unwind information to walk native stacks without frame pointers in BPF. We've integrated it into our continuous profiler project, Parca Agent.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Recently we posted patches on the lkml for a new filesystem called composefs. This is an image-based read-only filesystem with opportunistic file sharing and fs-verity based verification. This presentation will give a short demonstration of how to use it and present the usecases we wish to solve. Hoping to get feedback from interested users and linux filesystem developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EROFS aims to be a generic read-only filesystem for image-based distribution and runtime with high performance.  It has been a upstream part since Linux kernel 4.19(staging) and 5.4 with many adaptions landed.  In the past years, it gained several enhancements for container image and embedded use cases, such as FSDAX, EROFS over fscache, data deduplication, idmapped mounts, etc.  This presentation will show the recent updates and give the future roadmap.  Hopefully more people could get interested in EROFS and join us.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;From the workstation /home partition to a certificate store on an embedded system,
use cases abound for encrypting data at rest. The common goal is thwarting offline
attacks by keeping the plaintext key material safe from where an attacker could extract it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Ahmad will give a brief introduction to the kernel's trusted key
subsystem and his work in enabling it for unattended disk decryption on
NXP's i.MX line of embedded SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Rust in the Kernel (via eBPF)</title>
        <subtitle>Writing eBPF programs in Rust with Aya</subtitle>
        <track>Kernel</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux kernel already supports writing modules in Rust. There is also an ongoing effort of rewriting Linux subsystems in eBPF (for example HID-BPF). It almost feels like there is an ongoing race between Rust and eBPF to implement parts of the kernel, but both can be done at the same time - by writing eBPF programs in Rust with Aya!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aya is an eBPF library built with a focus on operability and developer experience. It allows for both user-land and kernel-land programs to be written in Rust - and even allows for sharing of code between the two! It has minimal dependencies. When linked with musl, it creates a truly portable, self-contained binary that can be deployed on many Linux distributions and kernel versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I would like to deep dive into the present state of Aya, with focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How it works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently supported features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Rust for Linux and Aya can benefit from each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our plans about BTF and CO-RE support, which is already being implemented and includes changes in Rust ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The BPF Hashmap and other hash-based BPF maps including Stackmap and Bloom Filters use an old hash function, jhash. Therefore, this should not be difficult to improve the maps performance by using a better hash function. However, this is true only in the ideal world, i.e., when we load the Linux kernel with mitigations=off. This is not as straightforward in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe obstacles which appear in the real world and how to approach them. Also, I will talk about how to benchmark BPF maps and kernel code in general and look into how fast BPF maps are actually performing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone who ever used eBPF has interacted with a loader(libbpf, cilium/ebpf, aya) but not many users know what actually happens behind the senses. I hope to give some insight into what it takes to load eBPF programs into the kernel and how features like BTF, Global data and CO:RE actually work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the past 10 years, Linux gaming came from a painful experience to a reality, with competitive performance, smooth experience and even an ArchLinux based handheld device, the Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progress was made possible by the effort of a strong community working in different parts of the stack, from Wine, userspace graphic drivers and finally the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming workloads have been pushing Linux development to tackle bottlenecks and enhancements never seem before. In this talk, we are going to cover the progress made to enhance game performance from the kernel side, current work and next challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Use-after-free bugs in drivers and what to do about them.</subtitle>
        <track>Kernel</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The devres resource management system in the linux kernel has been blamed for use-after-free bugs triggered from user-space via device files. We will show that this problem is not caused by devres but rather by common misconceptions about linux devices lifetimes and general errors in resource management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also discuss linux kernel frameworks that already deal with this problem, how they do it and how vulnerable subsystems can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Devres is a simple resource management system commonly used in linux device drivers. It's based on creating a linked list of various resources associated with given device. Managed resources can be acquired during the life-time of a device (typically when the device is probed after being bound to a driver) and will get released when the driver is detached from the device - be it on .probe() error or after .remove() returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On multiple occasions, devres has been blamed for use-after-free bugs that can be triggered from user-space in several subsystems. A simple way to trigger those bugs in vulnerable subsystems is to: open a device file, unbind the driver from the device and call any of the system calls relevant for this device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those bugs do exist, I believe devres has nothing to do with them, rather they are caused by managing resources with devres that should survive the driver unbind and instead live for as long as the underlying struct device's reference count does not drop down to 0. This talk will present detailed explanation and examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devres is actually an easy way to simplify error paths and REDUCE resource leaks and memory bugs. There is only a limited number of use-cases where devres must not be used and for most cases it can be hidden behind the subsystem's APIs. The aversion to devres that certain maintainers express is unjustified and this talk aims at changing people's minds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As new devices keep getting released with a stronger focus on upstream support, CI systems like KernelCI are becoming essential to quickly detect any regressions introduced and to allow long-term support to be sustainable. In this talk, I will show how several regressions were detected in the process of upstreaming support for a device, how KernelCI could have automatically detected them, what we're doing to make that happen going forward, and where test coverage still has room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;BoF for people interested in / working on MIPI camera support / libcamera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIPI cameras are cameras where there is a sensor directly connected to the laptop/tablet/phone's SoC, as typically found in smartphones but recently also showing up in x86 laptops. For these raw sensors a whole bunch of the processing and sensor control needs to be done by software (optionally with assistance from an ISP in the SoC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes these cameras a lot more complex then standard USB cameras which generate ready to use video frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scuttlebutt is a decentralised secure gossip platform. It is a protocol for building decentralized applications that works well offline and that no one person can control. Because there is no central server, Scuttlebutt clients connect to their peers to exchange information. Scuttlebutt is a flexible protocol, capable of supporting many different types of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will learn about the process of monitoring databases with a single open-source monitoring tool. We will analyze the data produced in customizable dashboards and identify the metrics that show us vulnerabilities in our databases wherever they are deployed. We'll look at ways to set up real-time alerts and get the most out of monitoring dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this talk, attendees will gain fundamental knowledge about database monitoring; they will be able to install Percona Monitoring and Management, an open-source tool to obtain metrics from their databases. In addition, they will be able to quickly identify the essential components of the Grafana-based PMM user interface and will be able to generate their dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Observability in Postgres</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Postgres provides a plethora of performance metrics useful for monitoring tools available through SQL. However monitoring a traditional relational database using modern observability tools presents some unique challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postgres's metrics can be extremely detailed and provide rich information about the relationships between the different database objects. However this requires custom SQL queries and the getting the right level of detail depends heavily on understanding style of architecture of the database schema. This kind of customization makes it difficult to deploy and maintain any dashboards, or alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even on a mundane level deploying an agent to interface through SQL introduces operational difficulty requiring additional custom work to coordinate the agent and database deploy and introducing many failure modes which can result in inaccurate metrics, no metrics, or even cause database outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on improving Postgres's support for modern observability tools and I have plans and challenges to talk about. Ideally I want to make  things work smoothly out of the box without having each site have to write custom queries and design custom dashboards to get the right level of data for their database and adapt it to their deployment environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenTelemetry is a collection of standards and tools to make it easy to get metrics, distributed traces, and logs out of applications. For example, OpenTelemetry's Java agent will instrument Java applications out-of-the-box, with no code change required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how to use these signals for application monitoring. We will introduce Grafana's open source databases: Loki for logs, Tempo for traces, and Mimir for metrics. And we will show how to use Grafana to explore the telemetry data for an example application running on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grafana and Prometheus metrics have been popular among platform engineers for monitoring Kubernetes clusters for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how application developers can benefit from Grafana as well, using open standards like OpenTelemetry, and open source monitoring backends like Loki, Tempo, and Mimir.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deploying an end-to-end observability system comes with many challenges. The organization has to decide how data will be collected, what data formats will be used, sampling strategies, filter sensitive data (a.k.a. PII), and ultimately send data to the observability platform of their choice. In this session, we will teach you how to roll out end-to-end observability data collection on Kubernetes using the OpenTelemetry project. You will learn how to effectively instrument applications using auto-instrumentation, deploy the OpenTelemetry collector, and collect traces, metrics, and logs. You will gain the knowledge needed to tackle the mentioned challenges. After this session, you will be able to understand and use OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries, collector and Kubernetes operator.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>Monitoring and Observability</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will walk through each pillar of API observability and we will learn how with Apache APISIX Plugins we can simplify these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We know that an API gateway offers a central control point for incoming traffic to a variety of destinations but it can also be a central point for observation as well since it is uniquely qualified to know about all the traffic moving between clients and our service networks. Instead of spending time integrating your services with other many tools and technologies to improve observability, you can easily manage all work with Apache APISIX Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of observability breaks down into three key areas: structured logs, metrics, and traces. In this talk, we will walk through each pillar of API observability and we will learn how with Apache APISIX Plugins we can simplify these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most observability platforms like (Prometheus, Skywalking, Opentelemetry, etc.) provide pre-built connectors and we will describe how you can easily integrate your API log data further derive useful metrics, and gain complete visibility into the usage, performance, and security of your APIs in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of observability tooling to analyze Logs, Metrics and Traces, it has become easier than ever to find the bottleneck in your software stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have identified the particular system introducing a user facing performance degradation, as its developer you need to understand which part (ideally down to the function and line of code) is slowing it down. With that insight you are able to effectively optimize your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show how profiles are collected, how they can be aggregated and visualized. And then how those insights can be used to optimize your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a focus on the Go ecosystem, most of the content of the talk should be transferable to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, a lot of applications run inside containers. The extra layer of
isolation provided by containerization brings specific challenges to monitor and
observe these applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspektor Gadget is a set of eBPF tools which permit monitoring and observing applications running inside containers, both locally or in distant Kubernetes
clusters.
By relying on eBPF, we are able to trace specific events while being lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, a lot of application run inside containers. The extra layer of

&lt;p&gt;Inspektor Gadget is a set of eBPF tools which permits monitoring and observing
of applications running inside containers, both locally or in distant Kubernetes
clusters.
By relying on eBPF, we are able to trace specific events while being lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present Inspektor Gadget from two points of views:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user point of view showing the tracing opportunities offered by the tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A technical point of view explaining how we adapted eBPF tools to fit them to
applications running in containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Along the presentation, the focus will first be set on local-gadget, which concentrates on locally running containers, then on kubectl-gadget, which
permits monitoring and observation of k8s containers.
The presentation will be punctuated by short demonstrations showing the possibilities offered by both tools.
specific to containers running on the same host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Best Practices for Operators Monitoring and Observability in Operator SDK</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Monitoring and Observability</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation is aimed for operator developers that plan to add or want to improve their operator monitoring.
We will present best practices and new tools that will help you get the best monitoring for your operator with a shorter and easier implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;All operators start small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the first metrics that we add, to a new operator, are the basic ones that help us in the development process.
When adding the first metrics, developers that are not yet experienced with monitoring, might add metrics that would later cause issues.
Like, metrics names that would need to be changed, metrics code that would complicate the core operator code, etc and the same for Alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will help developers to avoid pitfalls when implementing monitoring to their operator
and will direct them for best practices and new tooling that we added to Operator SDK to assist developers in the first steps in implementing monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT) project is aiming at improving the
quality of the Linux kernel by performing functional testing on Arm hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LKFT has built over 1 millions kernel per years other the last two years and
ran 140 millions tests on both emulation (qemu) and hardware devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present the current architecture that is able to build and
test millions of kernels with a really small team of engineers and at a
reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With great labs comes great responsibility! Open source CI systems such as KernelCI and MesaCI run hundreds of tests daily on various hardware platforms and require a reliable and diverse lab. In this presentation, we will walk through the challenges of maintaining and growing a LAVA lab focused on upstream testing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Successful CI initiatives such as KernelCI and MesaCI have been leveraging the Collabora LAVA lab for their automated upstream testing and development workflows, with over a hundred thousand test jobs running monthly on over 100 devices. Maintaining and scaling up on such a large lab comes with its own sets of requirements and challenges. As coverage increases in the project pipelines, the impact of any unreliability or failure in the hardware pool multiplies. Continuous monitoring and recovery mechanisms are crucial to ensure good device availability and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the lifecycle of devices inside the lab from the bring-up to the day-to-day care, as well as the ongoing efforts to make the Collabora LAVA lab more robust as it grows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Introducing Vegvisir: An automation framework for testing QUIC application logic</title>
        <subtitle>Who said using QUIC was easy?</subtitle>
        <track>Testing and Automation</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For years, the majority of internet applications have used either TCP or UDP as the transport layer protocol of choice. Recently, a new contestant - QUIC, an end-to-end encrypted protocol - has entered the ring. QUIC is being marketed as the successor to TCP and tackles some of its inherent problems. An excellent example is the Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking issue perceived by, for example, web pages. While QUIC holds many advantages over its predecessor, it still suffers from interoperability challenges and holds a number of open questions. The biggest one is: how do we efficiently test, measure, and debug the performance of applications using QUIC?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering the above question is non-trivial and plays a significant part in my research as a Ph.D. candidate. In this talk, we will – from a beginner's perspective – discuss why getting started with optimizing applications using QUIC as a protocol might seem daunting. We will discuss some tools available such as qlog, and why they can be more insightful than solely relying on packet traces. Finally, we will demonstrate our in-house developed automation framework called Vegvisir. Initially designed for analyzing the performance of video streaming over QUIC, it is now generalized for end-to-end testing of any networked applications. The goal of Vegvisir is to help alleviate some of the obstacles mentioned earlier, but also to ensure that developers and researchers can perform tests with QUIC consistently and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Observability-driven development with OpenTelemetry</title>
        <subtitle>Use traces to enrich your integration tests!</subtitle>
        <track>Testing and Automation</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing large systems with multiple microservices is hard to understand. You need to understand the whole system, all connections, and how the microservices interconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tracing you get a map of everything which makes your whole system easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to showcase traditional test-driven development vs the new observability-driven development. I'll use open-source tools like Tracetest and OpenTelemetry to showcase how to use trace-based testing and enrich integration tests with trace data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What's the problem?
Testing large systems and multiple microservices is hard to understand. Such a big system can quickly become convoluted. You need to be a specialist in that area to understand the whole system, all connections, and how the microservices interconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we solve it?
With tracing you get a map of everything which makes your whole system easier to understand.
I want to showcase traditional test-driven development vs the new observability-driven development with Tracetest and OpenTelemetry. With observability-driven development, you can improve your traces by using trace-based testing to enrich integration tests.
No more black boxes when running integration tests. You'll know exactly what's happening in each microservice. You'll also be able to add test specs and assertions for every step the transaction takes through your distributed system!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's our production use case?
Test-driven development is your thing. But, you’re using OpenTelemetry for traces? You have everything you need to move to observability-driven development. It will leverage your OpenTelemetry traces to create integration tests with more details and precision than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call it trace-based testing. It’s becoming popular to test systems at an integration or end-to-end level by applying assertions against the data contained in an OpenTelemetry trace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tests can check your code, they can verify your trace info is added correctly and can verify processes that show up deep in the trace worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re building an open-source tool called Tracetest (https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest) to make observability-driven development mainstream. It leverages the observability enabled by OpenTelemetry traces to allow you to create trace-based tests. These tests can check your code, they can verify your trace info is added correctly and can verify processes that show up deep in the trace worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Integration testing of GNOME, a desktop environment built from more than 200 separate components, is tricky. Since 2010 folk have been working towards better testing, and one outcome is the testing-only VM image "GNOME OS", built from the latest "main" and "master" branches of GNOME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we're trialling OpenQA to automatically detect regressions in GNOME OS as soon as they happen. In this talk, I'll speak a bit about how we got here, where we're going and some tips for getting started with your own OpenQA testing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Practical and fun automation for all your terminal sessions</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Termie introduces a new concept in terminal automation: an additional layer of interactivity on top of another interactive terminal session.  Modern debuggers and interfaces can overwhelm console users and clutter the screen with stack traces, excessive debugging information, database query details, and more.  Docker containers can also remove precious command line histories, which makes the console experience more tedious.  Termie allows for persistent histories across sessions, and adds a mechanism for clutter-free interaction.  It also provides some of the functionality of the venerable "expect", to further improve automation of interactive consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about using termie, and about some aspects of its implementation in the Raku programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Code coverage (the percentage of your code tested by your tests) is a great metric. However, coverage doesn’t tell you how good your tests are at picking up changes to your codebase - if your tests aren’t well-designed, changes can pass your unit tests but break production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutation testing is a great (and massively underrated) way to quantify how much you can trust your tests. Mutation tests work by changing your code in subtle ways, then applying your unit tests to these new, "mutant" versions of your code. If your tests fail, great! If they pass… that’s a change that might cause a bug in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll show you how to get started with mutation testing and how to integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline. After the session, you’ll be ready to use mutation testing with wild abandon. Soon, catching mutant code will be a routine part of your release engineering process!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers often use metrics as targets. Code coverage is one of the most common, and most prone to corner-cutting and abuse. Goodhart's Law states: When a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric (and trust us, we have a lot of memes to share with you about this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutation score is different. Because it tests your tests, coverage isn't enough - you have to write tests that are resistant to all the mutated code that wants nothing more than to sneak through your CI/CD pipeline into production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Penpot will be launched shortly before FOSDEM takes place, for a reason. Three years ago we presented our vision to the audience and we promised we would build a design &amp;amp; prototyping platform that was all about open standards (SVG, HTML, CSS) and open source, but also about collaboration between designers and developers at the design process level. We wanted to make FOSDEM 2023 the community event at which we demoed Penpot "GA", what it brings, why it matters, and what's next. We are extremely excited to share the good news with the open source design community!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;2022 has been a breaking year for us. We moved out from Alpha into Beta, enjoyed a ton of love from the community (libraries, templates, features, translations, tutorials) and we have kept adding features and making sure we are actively listening to users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A case study on a successful privacy by design project where we did everything wrong</subtitle>
        <track>Open Source Design</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2016 a group of innovators from healthcare, mental healthcare, social work and design teamed up to create a roadmap to a future-proof (health)care system. An important part of this healthcare system is an open source ecosystem of digital health applications that can cooperate in an integrated way. Right from the start, privacy has been an important part of the project: agency is at the core of the innovation project and agency is among the central values within privacy. So one of the central questions of the project was: “How to translate the principle of agency into design choices for data privacy within an ecosystem of digital health applications.” We will tell how this question was answered by looking back at the process and at the choices made about the user interaction and technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During this project we were confronted with three separate perspectives on privacy: a theoretical perspective that is generally focused on the philosophical meaning of privacy, secondly, a technological perspective driven by the suppliers of digital products and lastly a user interaction perspective, driven by the end user’s experience of privacy. The conflicting perspectives were holding back the progress of the project. Therefore we had to find a way to mediate between these separate perspectives. An important part of this mediation process was finding common values and translating these to overarching principles that are comprehensible to the different perspectives and stakeholders. Next these newfound principles were validated with end-users, representing the interaction perspective. For this purpose we used gamification and mock-ups to make the more abstract principles tangible and testable. Finally the general principles were translated to clear design guidelines for the technological perspective. This presentation will show how we combined a theoretical view on privacy with the users perspective and how we translated these into guidelines for user interaction and into a technical architecture. And you will leave with some practical tips when conducting comparable projects!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Helping your users help you</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many small to medium-sized open source projects depend on user donations for their primary source of funding.  Proper design of the funding webpage can have an outsized impact on whether your projects' end users decide to support your project financially.  Additionally, projects can easily pitch the funding ask too strenuously or not enough, leading to end user alienation and disengagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how to design an effective funding webpage that helps to grow your community and supports the long term viability of your project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Talking about donations is slightly taboo in the FLOSS world.  But the biggest secret is that people who donate money are one of your projects' largest assets because their contribution links them tightly to your project's community (coders, writers, artists, translators, end-users and other people who donate).  By running an effective donation program, you are growing your community and strengthening the long term resilience of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if your project doesn't need the funding directly, building a funding program will build your project in other ways.  Funding contributed to your project is ideally contributed upstream to your supporting libraries.  This process links multiple members with open source contributions that they were not even aware were helping them.  And this process starts with effective design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing the design consumer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to place the donation page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to optimize the page for both engagement and ease of use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy A/B testing without extra setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building effective community with your donation page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big red flags to avoid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this talk will give specific, concrete examples and results from the design process of the KiCad EDA suite's donation program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Creative Freedom Summit is a virtual event focused on promoting Open Source tools, spreading knowledge of how to use them, and connecting creatives across the FOSS ecosystem. The summit’s accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the first year of the event, along with potential changes for the following years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Creative Freedom Summit hosted by the Fedora Design Team is an annual virtual event to promote Open Source creative tools, features, and benefits of use. The Summit is a free -day event, with our first year kicking off on Tuesday, January 17th and running through Thursday, January 19th, 2023. Each day featured several informational sessions on various tools and topics related to Open Source creative software, as well as a social session to connect with other participants at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Freedom Summit is open to anyone interested in learning more about Open Source tools, how and why to use them, as well as to connect with other creatives working in the Open Source ecosystem. As part of the organisational team, the summit’s accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the pilot year of the event. We hope that you will join us and hopefully get involved in the planning for the next one! Or perhaps you’ll be motivated to organize your own Open Source Design event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Drupal has been a leader in digital accessibility for over an decade, and open source has played a key role. Mike Gifford has been spearheading accessibility in Drupal, and working with an open community has allowed us to pioneer some new design challenges. Working in the open has allowed us to tap expertise outside of our community. It has also given space for people with disabilities to become involved in a variety of roles. Accessibility best practices make it clear that accessibility needs to be considered at all levels of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will draw on the Drupal community but also engagement with other open communities, particularly through the We4Authors Cluster initiative of Funka with the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Practical UX at OpenProject</title>
        <subtitle>Musing after 1½ years of working on the UX of open source software</subtitle>
        <track>Open Source Design</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;User experience is often overlooked in open source projects, and this was the case with OpenProject too. In 2021, OpenProject hired two UX designers (including me) to improve usability and bring it to even more people. In this talk, we'll look at the challenges, processes and learnings gleaned from the past year and half of setting up a UX team within an established open source project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common complaints about open source software is bad UX. This can mean a lot of things to a lot of people (and modern design isn't always great either) but generally, a lot of it seems to be designed for and by technical people who don't mind configuring, menu-diving and reading the manual. Open source projects also tend to not invest their (admittedly often limited) resources on UX and UX designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenProject is an open-project management and collaboration tool that's been around for over ten years. The software went through its many versions and iterations without a dedicated design team and did so without this necessarily being a problem. But in August 2021 OpenProject GmbH hired not one but two UX designers to improve usability and user experience. I'm one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why OpenProject decided to invest in UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The challenges of designing for (and around) a tool with lots of legacy code, architecture and design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we're (slowly but surely) implementing a design system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we balance a seemingly endless list of UX optimisations with new feature development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we've learnt in the past year and a half&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we plan to go forward in 2023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Understanding and Managing the Dependency in SBOM with the New Feature of SW360</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Software Bill of Materials</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has emerged as an important practice to manage the risks in the software supply chain. To achieve this goal, understanding and managing the dependency is an indispensable task when applying the SBOM. In SW360 - a software component catalog application, we proposed features to manage SBOM in Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) format last year (https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/how&lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;manage&lt;em&gt;oss&lt;/em&gt;license&lt;em&gt;obligation&lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;sbom&lt;/em&gt;using&lt;em&gt;sw360&lt;/em&gt;new_features/). But because of the limitation of the old features, dependency management is still an urgent problem to be solved. The projects registered in SW360 can only create their dependency graphs by searching the components registered in SW360 dynamically. However, to apply SBOM, it's necessary to enable projects to store dependency graphs for themselves. Therefore, Adding the dependency management function for projects registered in SW360 is important for importing and managing SBOM information such as SPDX information in SW360. This function will also help in managing vulnerabilities of projects registered in SW360. To achieve this goal, TOSHIBA proposed and developed a series of features in SW360 to help users in managing the dependencies of their projects more conveniently. With these user-friendly features, users could register, view and modify the dependency graphs of their projects flexibly. Combined with the existing SBOM management function in SW360, the new features will help users to use SBOM in practice more easily. These features will also help SW360 to collaborate with other tools and explore more possibilities for managing vulnerabilities. In this presentation, I will first explain the issues related to dependency management in SW360. Then I would like to introduce and demonstrate these new features of SW360 developed by TOSHIBA. These features may include some that are still under development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>AMENDMENT: Automated SBoM generation with OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project</title>
        <subtitle>A case study of automated SBoM generation in meta build systems</subtitle>
        <track>Software Bill of Materials</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SBoM are becoming a critical component in ensuring the integrity of our Software Supply Chains. Many current tools for SBoMs generation focus on two ways of generating SBoMs: generating them from the initial source code, or post-mortem analysis of completed systems and artifacts. While these are both valid and useful methods of analysis, less focus has been put on the tooling that pulls upstream source code together and generates the completed system artifacts, such as a distro build system or more generically any "meta-build" system. Using OpenEmbedded as a case study, Joshua will cover the unique strengths that generating SBoMs in meta-build systems can provide, as well as the challenges when trying to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Multiple teams at Siemens evaluated several SBOM formats available on the internet.
All of them decided to use CycloneDX with some custom extensions. This talk is about
the BOM format itself, why we decided to use CycloneDX as a base, and what the goals
for this BOM are.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How FOSSology works with SPDX</subtitle>
        <track>Software Bill of Materials</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FOSSology is a open source license compliance software system and toolkit. As a toolkit you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line or from web UI. FOSSology can generate SPDX SBOM for source code in RDF and tag-value formats, including other reports, and is becoming more SPDX compliant. With the new license naming changes in FOSSology, users can provide more elaborate and correct SPDX License Identifiers for the licenses. The tool has also improved its reporting using SPDX version 2.3 with new fields.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FOSSology uses SPDX reporting formats to generate SBOM for source code. The project has recently improved the reporting by providing users and option to give SPDX License Identifier. This helps in maintaining the SPDX specified format for the reports in FOSSology.
Apart from using SPDX reporting formats, FOSSology also supports following SBOM reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEP5 format, which is predominantly used within Debian community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLIXML report, an in-house format, which reports about licensing and related information in XML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Build recorder: a system to capture detailed information</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Build recorder: a system to capture detailed information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue that is currently plaguing a number of people working in SBOMs is that, given a generated binary artifact of a project, it is not easy (or even possible) to point back to the exact files that were used for creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a typical setup, a project has a number of source files written in a programming language and a build process creates a binary executable.  However, in most cases only a subset of the files is being processed (others being test cases, for example), a number of other files are also used (standard header files residing elsewhere in the system), and a number of tools are being invoked (each introducing another dependency).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will present build_recorder, an innovative command-line tool that allows tracking of complete and detailed information about every single file that somehow affects the build process.  The tool works transparently while the software is being built, without requiring any change to the source code or build system.  For each file used, a number of attributes are being saved, like name, full path, checksum and exact use.  We will be detailing the information kept, the basics of operation, the generated output format, and planned future enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work has been the result of a 2022 Google Summer of Code project for the GFOSS organization.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Functional Safety evidences require a set of all documents that proofs the complete implementation and verification of all relevant work products. This does not only include code and tests, but also every other associated piece of documentation, like requirement specifications, architecture and designs, safety analysis etc. In terms of the typical functional safety development this set is called safety case. This safety case is nothing else than an (S-)BOM of the safety release. This talk will demonstrate how SPDX relationships can be used to generate this "Safety SBOM" as evidence for a complete safety case.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>The gold standard of communicating licensing and copyright information</subtitle>
        <track>Software Bill of Materials</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Developing, using, and re-using Free Software is fun, but declaring licensing and copyright information is not. REUSE changes that. With three simple steps, it makes declaring licensing and copyright information unambiguous and perfectly human- and machine-readable, making life easier for everyone involved in the software supply chain. In this presentation, we will present the latest learnings from big projects that recently became REUSE-compliant. In addition, we will provide you with an update on the latest features of the REUSE CLI tool.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As software has gotten more complex over the last years, the importance of declaring licensing information has become even more crucial. The FSFE's REUSE initiative contributes to the goal of clearly displaying legal information in Free Software projects by embedding it into every file of the repository. Any project following the REUSE recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable for both humans and machines. We ensure that individuals, organisations, and companies that are reusing code are aware of and respect the licence terms chosen by its original author, thus facilitating the communication of this legal information among everyone involved in the software supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REUSE integrates seamlessly into development processes and other best practices of indicating Free Software licences. In addition, there are tools and documentation to help you get started. During this talk, we will take you through the learnings of large projects becoming REUSE compliant (e.g. curl or GNUHealth) and present the latest features of our REUSE helper tool, which makes declaring license information a quick and fun endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Presenting the toolchain that we have created for Eclipse Oniro, we believe the single largest compliance effort by many metrics ever attempted for Yocto projects, featuring besides than the usual suspects (Fossology, Scancode, SPDX, BANG, Gitlab CI) some specifically developed tools, including a dashboard, aliens4friends, a graph database to map dependencies and license incompatibilities, a license resolver and way more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yocto has (as a recent addition) its own facilities to create a SBOM. We worked on some complements that need to be added to consume it for all bells and whistles of a full OpenChain conformant software composition analysis. We have created a way to preserve this information throughout the entire process of creating a build and can demonstrate how it is possible to uniquely identify each and every file that goes into the final image, resolve each binary file license from a large mix of diversely licensed source files, find the dependencies, find potential incompatibilities and &lt;em&gt;reuse&lt;/em&gt; this information by sharing it publicly. This for a project whose base of data and number of vetted licenses,files and packages is very large (one would say "huge"). Therefore, what we regard as an unprecedented amount of automation had to be put to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>In SBOMs We Trust: How Accurate, Complete, and Actionable Are They?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Software Bill of Materials</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the world of manufacturing, a bill of materials (BOM) constitutes a quantified list of raw materials and components used to produce, for instance, a given refrigerator. The equivalent in the software world would be a list of all third-party libraries needed to compile, test, and release a software product. There is, however, a significant difference between the BOM for a refrigerator and a software product. Unlike for refrigerators, not all software products' ingredients (i.e., third-party libraries) are actually used!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present findings from our recent academic research comparing SBOMs generated from different sources of abstraction (i.e., manifest data and call graph data) to highlight that potential inaccuracy can hamper the actionability of SBOMs. Evaluating the severity of security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries is one such example. Moreover, we will also demonstrate from a recent experiment that available tools generate different SBOMs for the same software product, showcasing that SBOMs are not trivial to standardize. Finally, we will wrap up the talk with a discussion on challenges and opportunities to establish a ground truth for SBOMs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a record of components, SBOMs can vary wildly in how they describe software. Some SBOMs lean toward security and some toward licensing. Some do a good job in their own niche, while others do not even offer enough information to even understand what it is they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will try to visit the 7 key data points (syntactic correctness, dependencies, licensing, semantic structure, software identifiers, supplier data, and software integrity info) required to make sure your SBOM is useful to the widest possible audience. We will take an inner look into real-world SBOMs using the Kubernetes &lt;code&gt;bom&lt;/code&gt; outliner. We will inspect how they are structured, and the data they offer looking for clues on how we could improve them with the goal of learning what a great Software Bill of Materials looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>What should be the primary goal of every community team</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Congrats, you have a community team!  Maybe if you are lucky, you have some DevRel folks too! In many companies, the community or DevRel teams are small, impossibly small for the work that needs to be done.  If you are like most companies I have talked to, your job in one of these roles is to gain lots and lots of adoption, “Grow the user base,” your boss will tell you.  The issue is how does a team of 1 or a handful of people build and support tens of thousands or even potentially millions of users… the answer is you don’t.  Rather the goal of most teams should be to support and grow external advocates and evangelists who can do the work for you.  Hiring 2 people to tell the world how awesome your software is can only reach so far… but if those 2 people get 1000 people to tell their story that has a massive reach.  So how do you build such a system?  How do you measure it?  I will walk through what I have learned when talking to hundreds of community teams over the last 5 years and share with you what I have seen works and what does not.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>What I learned about leading a healthy project from speaking to 50+ maintainers</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Community</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For many (many) months, in semi-regular intervals, I've been one of the organizers of contributing.today - a livestreamed fireside chat on open source licensing, funding, mental health and neurodiversity in open source, and driving different communities forward... differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2021 Tidelift survey of 400 open source maintainers found that 46% of maintainers are not paid at all, and only 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for maintenance work. Over half (59%) have quit or considered quitting maintaining a project, and almost half of respondents listed lack of financial compensation as their top reason for disliking being a maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the projects maintained by the proverbial single individual in Nebraska in their free time narrative, there are other reasons for projects "going bad". I'd like to share some stories, straight from the horse's mouth, share some of the give-aways of unhealthy projects, and together find ways for mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Cultural Relativism</title>
        <subtitle>a Prism for Constructing Cross Cultural Communities</subtitle>
        <track>Community</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cross cultural teams bring a special set of pitfalls that are not present in mono cultural teams; from hidden misunderstandings to perceived hostility or indifference.   This talk introduces the anthropological concept of cultural relativism, explores how it can be used to uncover potential conflicts that arise out of cultural differences, and presents culturally sensitive strategies for addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will gain an understanding of the interplay between culture and perception, and will understand how to apply the prism of cultural relativism to detect, understand, and disarm cultural differences that lead to failure within cross cultural communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Becoming an open source volunteer contributor has changed the entire course of my professional career. In hindsight, I realize how lucky I was that the first FOSS project I contributed had a welcoming to newcomers culture. In this presentation, we will discuss how to build a thriving contributor community around a FOSS project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about the “201” in the title? Just like in a University course catalog, it means we are going to examine the topic beyond the basics. I will share insights and case studies from the work of our team supporting contributors to the 4 foundational libraries in the Scientific Python ecosystem, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also introduce (and invite you to join!) the Contributor Experience Project, a new community of practice and an open source community-led project dedicated to developing best practices for onboarding and supporting contributors to open source. Our goal is to provide a space to reflect, engage, and offer advancements in the work of effective transfer of knowledge, contributor hospitality and support, project leadership, and social infrastructure development for the entire open source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We do not have a common way to show all our contributions to the free culture community as a resumé. If you are a developer, you can show your Github/Gitlab profile; if you are a Wikimedia project editor, you can show your Wikimedia profile; and if you contribute to OpenStreetMaps, you can show your profile, but why not collect all those contributions in a Free Culture CV?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will analyze several communities' state of the art of personal contribution metrics and propose/discuss the main technical (features, implementation, format) and ethical (data fields, data privacy) ideas to get an autogenerated Free Culture CV.
This Free Culture CV will be useful for recruiters that want to know better their candidates, where and how much contributions they provided to Free Culture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Creating Clear Linkage between Open Source and Standards</subtitle>
        <track>Community</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We have a rich and evolving set of standards that we use to build and deploy interoperable systems. We also have a talented and productive open source community that creates code intended for use in these systems and their ongoing operation. The challenge is shifting from defining standards and writing code to knowing which standards to use and finding code that accelerates implementation and deployment of these standards. This challenge increases as we become more efficient at defining new standards and creating new open source projects.
What if we could make it easier to navigate this landscape? What if we could create clear links between standards and code? This would  make our open source and  standards communities more productive. It would also make the great work they do more useful and rewarding. Fortunately, a set of practices is being defined and put in practice to make make it easy to identify and find open source code related to IETF standards. Join this session to learn what new mechanisms  exist, how to use them,  and to how help shape what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When discussing contributions, we still see a lot of emphasis on the code contributions into project repositories. But the open source world is extensive and diverse, and everyone can find their place there. Your project will benefit from various experiences that non-coders can bring to the table. Isn’t that cool when you receive an issue with an interesting bug from the community, read about a user case in a blog or a review, or someone makes a video guide for your product? And more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will look into different types of non-code contributions to the open source project. We will discuss how they can provide value to your project and team, and how to invite, engage and empower non-code contributors. We will cover various ways to find and measure those contributions and recognize individuals based on the experience that Percona Community Team gained working with non-code contributions to Percona repositories.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How to effectively push for Free Software all over Europe</subtitle>
        <track>Community</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to promote Free Software in public administrations? Then the campaign framework of "Public Money? Public Code!" is the right choice for you; no matter if you want to do it as an individual or as a group; if you have a small or large time budget; whether you are targeting the national level or your local administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present some inspiring success stories from the campaign around Europe and invite you to follow their example. For this we will explain how the campaign framework can be used to push for the adoption of Free Software friendly policies in your area; be it your public administration, your library, your university, your city, your region, or your country.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Communities are the backbone of the Free Software universe – not only in developing ideas and contributing code. Dedicated enthusiasts all over Europe help spreading the idea of software freedom and anchoring the call for public code on all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 200 organisations, and tens of thousands of individuals already signed the “Public Money? Public Code!” open letter, demanding that publicly financed software should be made publicly available under Free Software licenses. Together we contacted politicians, decision makers, and civil servants on all levels -- from the European Union and national governments, to city mayors and the heads of public libraries about this demand. This did not just lead to important discussions about software freedom with decision makers, but also already to specific policy changes. Already, we have administrations from Spain, Sweden and Germany supporting “Public Money? Public Code!”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many projects struggle to find people who will actively participate in their projects and continue to participate over the long term. We are in a situation now where there are a lot of open source projects and not enough contributors. Maintainers are burning out and in desperate need for help. This session will provide practical advice and suggestions for ways to encourage participation while avoiding some common barriers that prevent people from contributing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Maintaining an open source project is hard work that often extends out over several years, and maintainer burnout is common within open source projects. It can be hard for already overworked maintainers to balance the day to day work required to keep the project running while also investing in additional activity to increase future community sustainability. This includes getting help with all of the different types of contributions required to make an open source project successful: documentation, marketing, community management, and so much more. The good news is that we have best practices, resources, guides, and templates available to make it easier for maintainers and projects to build a contributor strategy that leads to a strong and growing community for an open source project over the long term. This talk will help you apply those resources in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will have several major sections. 1) Discussion about the major factors that impact contributor growth. 2) Developing and executing on a long-term contributor growth strategy, including governance, new contributor onboarding, and mentoring. 3) Using contributor ladders to promote contributors into leadership positions as more maintainers to share the workload can reduce maintainer burnout over time. 4) Metrics for measuring project sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience will walk away with a better understanding of how to grow their contributor base and build a community around their open source project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Centering DEI Within Your Open Source Project </title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Community</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The CHAOSS project represents a potential force for power and good in open source. This session includes speakers who took part in a two-year long reflection on DEI practices within the CHAOSS project. The session will help other open source projects in their work towards improving diversity, equity, and inclusion by exploring practices within the CHAOSS project first, then using those examples as points of reference for other projects. Our efforts have focused us on newcomer experiences, community surveys, and sustaining the people within the project. In particular, the session will discuss these efforts, aimed at answering the question of: How do we help open source communities to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Intro: Our CHAOSS DEI reflection team is amazing. We have been able to work together over the last few years, building and establishing direction for the CHAOSS project and others. Our work has resulted in many improvements within the CHAOSS project as well as external engagements aimed at better centering DEI within open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main idea 1: Supporting new contributors and making your onboarding process smooth helps with contributor retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting detail 1: Challenges include language barriers, time zones, access to tools from bandwidth limitations or other access limitations, merging in and accepting contributions in a timely manner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting detail 2: Helpful strategies include improving documentation, open office hours, welcome slackbot, accepting contributions of all kinds, having a newcomer space in slack/communication channels, onboarding calls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Main idea 2: Our two-year reflection process did not always go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting detail 1: Building newcomer experiences has been challenging. The CHAOSS global community has grown tremendously, for example, the African chapter has grown to over 180 members in the last few months– and as such, newcomer onboarding and paths to contribution became a priority for us. Our expectation was to make a difference and directly assist newcomers in CHAOSS since many of us  can relate to their pain of getting overwhelmed by the many parts in CHAOSS. It is  true that we made a significant impact; however, we had to reevaluate our first plan and improve on it. For example, office hours didn't get as much attention as we would have liked, so we adjusted the time and cadence, then went one step further with documentation diversity for newcomers (specifically the teams' sheet and quickstart for newcomers). More recently, we started a strategy document for newcomers' onboarding and have kickstarted newcomer onboarding calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Main idea 3: Strategic use of community surveys helps you to better understand the feelings, emotion, and qualitative feedback of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting detail 1: Make sure the community survey is completely anonymous and no personal information will be collected, and is GDPR compliant. Access to data should be limited and only report aggregated data on a high level. Have clear goals for what you want to learn more about, but be open to organic community response. Also consider troll-ish responses, and follow set standards when asking about demographic data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We have learned to be patient with our work. Advancing DEI in open source is challenging as we attend to corporate interests, community needs, and, most importantly, the safety of people for whom our efforts have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Do we still need to have virtual events? </title>
        <subtitle>My learnings from organizing virtual community events</subtitle>
        <track>Community</track>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic, we were all forced to move our events to virtual platforms, and we got used to attending events online. Even as our lives are returning to normal and people are returning to in-person events, I believe there will continue to be a place for virtual events as the virtual format offers some important advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Ray will discuss some of the advantages of virtual events, such as smaller resource requirements, simpler logistics, easier distribution of content, and opportunities for experimentation. In addition, virtual events do not need to be limited to tutorial-type sessions, but they can also be used to provide additional opportunities for community members to get together, network, and collaborate (e.g., for triaging issues, working on documentation, etc.). Even as life returns to normal, virtual events should remain an important tool–and complement what we’re doing with in-person events–for helping open-source communities grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray will also discuss some of the common mistakes and challenges in virtual events, such as limited opportunities for casual interactions, difficulty facilitating hands-on work, time zone challenges, etc., and how we can work together to mitigate these issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You might think that Kotlin is the programming language of Android…
Well, it's only partially true, and that's not even Kotlin's raison d'être.
Kotlin 1.0 (2016) had experimental support for JavaScript, and 6 years later, we're sticking to it on the WEB, in the backend, on Android of course, and now on (native) iOS as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to learn why you might, or might not want to follow suit.
This talk will be both an up to date introduction to Kotlin, and sharing our experience with it on the WEB.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Doom is maybe the game that runs on on any possible platform. In that regard, I ported Managed Doom to the browser with WebAssembly through .Net Blazor and some JavaScript.
The original game that I ported is an open source port of Doom written in .net called Managed Doom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I this talk, I will share with you how I quickly managed to port the source code from the desktop version to the browser. I'll also share my experiments with .Net 7 and the changes with regard to interoperability with JS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Web APIs have come a long way. You can create web apps that interact with devices via USB or BlueTooth with the respective Web API. You can build games on the web that is controlled via controllers! Join me to learn how I hacked a PS5 controller to play web games.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The bridge between native apps and web apps is getting smaller and smaller, enabling developers to provide a native experience to their users. This is possible only because of the continuous work on the Web APIs. One such API is the WebHID API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll introduce the WebHID API. I'll share all the possibilities and issues with the API. The talk will be accompanied by a live demo. In the demo, I'll code a web game that is controlled via a PS5 controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway will be the audience learning about the WebHID API which would hopefully get the community more involved!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Overlay networks (also sometimes called, inappropriately, "darknet") are able to anonymize peers and to fully encrypt all messages within a network. Creating a javascript application which is implementing true "privacy-by-design" is not that hard by using the I2P SAM library. This is the core developer of the library showing its usage and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation has the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation: why I2P-SAM got developed (3')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up the distributed overlay I2P network for testing (4')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an application using the I2P-SAM library (10')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use cases: wide range of peer-to-peer applications (3')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q &amp;amp; A (5')&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Strong Dynamic Type Checking for JavaScript</title>
        <subtitle>Where TypeScript is helpless, JavaScript Proxies come to the rescue!</subtitle>
        <track>JavaScript</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript developers learned to love TypeScript after seeing the benefits of static type-checking. But there is still a lot of data that that TypeScript is not able to check, because it is only known at runtime: JSON responses from an API, user inputs in a form, content taken from client-side local storages, browsers API quirks... In that case, you can only assume the types and pray for the best, or manually code tedious specific type checks. I'd like to introduce you to ObjectModel, an open source library I created with the intent to bring automatic strong dynamic type-checking to JavaScript projects. By leveraging ES6 Proxies, this library ensures that your variables always match the model definition and validation constraints you added to them. Thanks to the generated exceptions, it will help you spot potential bugs and save you time spent on debugging. I will also discuss the many other benefits of validating types at runtime, because as you will see, it leads to more than just type checking.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will present a few scenarios where TypeScript is helpless to detect type errors. Then I will discuss about ES6 Proxies, and how you can make type-safe objects in JavaScript itself. Finally I will present ObjectModel, a mature, well tested open source library that has ~2500 weekly downloads on NPM. ObjectModel is very easy to master: no new language to learn, no new tools, no compilation step, just a minimalist and intuitive API in a plain old JS micro-library. The audience should be able to immediately understand the interest of this library regarding the type assertions, but as a conclusion I will show how ObjectModel can also be used for other usecases such as form validation or API unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A security researcher known by the nickname percidae has drawn my attention to the Angular compilations.
By bundling a single page application without code splitting, SPAs can make the job for penetration testers easier.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will look into an Angular app and highlight areas, where means for performance optimisation can lead to a more secure app.
At the end of the presentation you should have a good understanding about how to read a webpack compilation for a SPA.
You will know where to look for your own code and what webpack pulls in in addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other SPA frameworks could be affected as well, but are out of scope given the time constraint of this presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtitles will be provided after the event as .srt if I can find the time. Otherwise I encourage you to contact me and I'll send them.
Accessibility is a human right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The problems you will have when creating a plugins system for your shiny UI project</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>JavaScript</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When creating a plugin system for a UI project, some of the questions one will undoubtedly have to answer are: What should we allow to be extended? What should the lifecycle of plugins be? How can developers test and distribute plugins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will share the issues and questions we faced when developing a plugin system for Headlamp, a Kubernetes UI project, and how we addressed them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UIs and their effectiveness can be very subjective. What works for some users will very likely not please many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Open Source, a full adaptation of a project to one's needs can be achieved by forking and modifying a project but that often results a massive effort to keep the fork or downstream changes close to upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to maintaining a fork can be a comprehensive plugin system. Such systems allow a project’s functionality to be extended via code that's dynamically loaded. Such extensions or plugins allow developers to isolate their changes and focus on them, thus avoiding having to fork and modifying the original project (or keeping changes to a minimum), and it becomes the base project maintainers' responsibility to keep the plugins working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a very flexible language to accomplish such extensions in a project by dynamically loading code, and React allows to reuse components in an isolated way, but developing a plugins system comes with many decisions and implications: What should we allow to be extended (and how)? When should we load plugins? What if they fail to load? What about the lifetime of plugins’ React components? How to avoid bundling modules that will be available in the base project when plugins are loaded? How should end users run the plugins? How can they test the plugins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to figure out all these questions when developing Headlamp, a Kubernetes UI that can be run as a web or desktop app and was created to offer a generic UI in its core but allowing users to modify and brand it through plugins, instead of having to maintain a fork of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will share how we addressed the questions around creating a plugin system: how we used webpack’s external modules to avoid bundling core modules, how we first shipped only type definitions of the libraries plugins use (and later decided we needed to ship the source code itself), how we created a helper script to bootstrap and keep updates under control, and many other considerations. Hopefully this will help early-stage projects keep these implications and possible solutions in mind when developing their own extension points. We’d also like to get others’ perspectives and comments on what we could have done differently, in the Q&amp;amp;A session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Are you eager to migrate your entire codebase to Vue 3 and composition API? Before starting the long journey away from Vue 2.6 you should consider a few intermediate steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compatibility with your dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider a step-by-step migration passing trough Vue 2.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what about the Vite/Vitest ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Node.js is branded as a single threaded, asynchronous, non-blocking Javascript runtime. What does this really mean? What is this V8 I keep hearing about? How does it differ from javascript that runs in the browser?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If questions like these intrigue you or have crossed your mind in the past, you're not alone. I too wanted to understand what's going on under the hood of the buzzword soup that is Javascript runtime(s). In this talk, I will go through my findings and past experiences on the topic. We will cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the Javascript runtime architecture. We'll try to make sense of concepts like the Eventloop, V8, libuv, frame rendering and WebAPIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the differences b/w the frontend and backend runtimes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about micro-tasks vs macro-tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present how to visualize the NPM dependencies ecosystem of your node project using the elevated city of BabiaXR, in VR using the webXR standards. We will start with a step-by-step tutorial on how to retrieve the needed data from the node project, and how to build a VR scene for the browser using only a few lines of HTML, including the BabiaXR toolset based on A-Frame. We will analyze the important features of the project, such the license usage, vulnerabilities, community, and employment of the dependencies installed. All of these metrics are mapped to building aspects (height, area, and color).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The continuous emergence of OSS web development projects makes the \npm network a field of study and most important the dependencies that these projects install, adding community, vulnerabilities, or size issues to the software development process. NPM registry is a network where most web developers upload their packages, this network has been shown to grow with time. The need to control these ecosystem dependencies is an active field in academia and industry. We present a VR city for analyzing the NPM dependencies of a node project with the goal of understanding the information about the licenses, vulnerabilities, community, and employment of the dependencies installed in order to detect and prevent issues derivated from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For creating the VR scene in the browser, we will use BabiaXR, a toolset for data visualization in VR for the web, in this case, we will focus on the elevated city, being the buildings the packages installed by npm, and the level of the dependency represented as an elevated quarter of the city. In this talk, we will follow a step-by-step tutorial for retrieving the data and needed metrics and we will show how to use this VR scene and how to change these metrics in real time, updating the city in order to see information about the license usage, vulnerabilities, community or package employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk requires basic knowledge of the NPM ecosystem, nothing else beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Using Webpack Module federation to break free from monoliths in UI</subtitle>
        <track>JavaScript</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, web applications are built as monoliths. Complex applications are typically organized into smaller packages, but these are still bundled and built together as part of the given application deployment. Micro-frontends allow developers to break out from this model by allowing a single web application to be split into multiple projects that are built, deployed and updated separately and served from different web -servers but still able to seamlessly integrate with the given application.Large projects tend to have lots of teams and collaborators working on different parts of the same application within the same code repository. Managing and coordinating releases can be difficult, since everyone involved with the project works towards the same release schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will highlight how Micro-frontends can be architected in any project using Webpack's module federation feature.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As a maintainer of an open-source UI library, most challenging requests are not always about performances or bugs. It can also be about customization. This topic is a permanent balance between code maintainability, developer experience, and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience as React developper at MUI, I will present most of the customization we face, and what are the usual strategies to answer them, and the tradeoff they imply. Allowing you to add customization in your own components or have an overview of how your favorite library manages customization.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right components of a digital architecture is essential but  not enough. As needs and technology evolve, organisations need to design systems in a way that allows to add end extend capabilities to it, without incurring in a complex refactoring. In this talk we will start with a simple website and progressively add capabilities and "layers" to it, from visual components to service orchestration, leveraging a MACH (Microservices based, API-first, Cloud-native SaaS and Headless) approach.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Firefox Profiler was born as the Gecko Profiler, the internal tool that Firefox developers use to analyze and improve the performance of the Firefox browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we replaced the Firefox Devtools' performance panel with this powerful tool, because we thought that Web Developers should also have access to the same data. While this newer tool provides a lot more information than what was previously available, it's also more complicated as a result. In this talk I'll explain and show the basics, so that you'll then be able to use the tool for your own profit.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the session, you'll understand what a profiler is, know how to capture a profile, and navigate in the Firefox Profiler UI like a pro. You'll be able to share performance profiles with your colleagues, report performance problems to open source libraries or Mozilla engineers. You'll know that in the performance world, measuring is always better than guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Firefox Profiler is a React-based open source web application that is open for contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Numerical simulations of physical phenomena are the usual use cases for HPC architectures. However, as they produce more and more data, how can we efficiently analyze and visualize their output ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present ParaView as a framework for visualizing and analyzing extreme scales of scientific data. Focus will be given specifically to data distribution and resource allocation along with the "in-situ" workflow and current support for heterogeneous compute architectures.
Strong of 20 years of development with performance in mind, ParaView is continuously improved, relying on state of the art libraries (such as MPI, OpenMP, VTK-m).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Simplifying the creation of Slurm client environments</title>
        <subtitle>A Straw for your Slurm beverage</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Slurm is the most widely used batch scheduler for HPC systems. The Open Source Software community
is very active in the development surrounding the Slurm ecosystem, contributing CLI tools for accounting, monitoring, and notebooks among others. A lot of these client environments are nowadays created on containers, which have become a ubiquitous part of running applications.
However, this way of working provides new challenges in HPC environments, especially when using Slurm.
Slurm requires careful management of shared cluster secrets and cluster-wide configuration files that need to be in sync in order to work efficiently and securely.
This talk proposes a novel and simple tool called straw, which allows the creation of secret-less and config-less Slurm client environments. Therefore simplifying the creation of (containerised) environments by removing the burdens of maintaining config files, sensitive munge secrets, and additional daemons.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will first provide an introduction to Slurm, followed by a description (mostly drawing from personal experience) of common patterns and pitfalls when creating containers that interact with Slurm clusters for different purposes (monitoring, notebooks, etc).
Next, I will introduce Straw, explaining why it was needed and why despite its simplicity (it mostly just fetches a bunch of config files), it is able to perform a task that regular Slurm tools can't, therefore simplifying Slurm client environments.
Finally, I will conclude by showing a simple example of how the tool can be used, and how it compares to the usual scenarios in which config files, extra daemons, and secrets need to be carefully managed.
If time allows it, I might detail some of the weaknesses of this approach: the fact that the Slurm protocol isn't really documented, and therefore this tool relies on "reverse-engineering" (as much as one can say reverse engineering when no documentation exists, but the code is available) to keep up with new Slurm releases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of HPC systems across the world, and nearly as many ways of interacting with them using job submission systems. Therefore, migrating complex HPC workflows from a system to another may prove challenging. We present Troika, a tool that aims to abstract the details of the job submission system from the user, providing a single entry point for submitting, monitoring, and interrupting jobs on multiple HPC systems. Troika allows for a site-agnostic job script with directives, that can be translated to a script that the job submission system understands, based on configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troika has been designed with extensibility in mind, to enable support for as many job submission systems as possible, as well as differences in the use of such systems. Troika is free software written in Python, exposing multiple entry points for hooks and plug-ins. It is a fundamental part of ECMWF's 24/7 time-critical operational and research workflows, making the glue between the batch scheduler and the workflow manager, where it handles hundreds of thousands of jobs each day. We will present how Troika works, as well as giving insights into its current and future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Azimuth helps users self-service create Science Platforms, such as JuyterHub and Slurm.
Sometimes this requires self-service creation of RDMA enabled Kubernetes clusters.
OpenStack can use SR-IOV using VF-LAG to provide RoCE RDMA within VMs.
We make use of K8s Cluster API to provision K8s using OpenStack servers.
We then use multus and macvlan CNIs to give k8s pods RDMA networking.
Testing the performance is automated using a Volcano based K8s operator.
We are working on also bringing this power to OpenStack Magnum.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How to deal with validation as an HPC software?</title>
        <subtitle>An approach to power software testing at scale</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scientific Computing is constantly evolving, relying on technologies increasing in complexity. Codes produced in that field require testing and validation to assess their performance and reliability. This additional but inevitable task is often of low direct added value compared to the deployment costs. Yet multiple solutions dedicated to testings, including some HPC specific, are currently available -- our solution has unique specificities. "Parallel Computing Validation System" (PCVS) is an HPC-aware YAML-based job orchestration tool. It offers the unique capability of retargeting tests, decoupling benchmarks and execution environments. This way, it allows the same job set to be re-run to compare two standards without modifying test specifications. This validation set may be scaled automatically depending on available resources, whether the process runs on a single node (like a workstation) or a thousand-node supercomputer. Beyond a one-time shot, PCVS can log several successive executions of benchmarks for browsing, inspection, and post-processing through a dedicated Python interface. More than a metric, PCVS can build validation trends, providing better visualization to track project evolution, leading to better software quality.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we introduce PCVS, a powerful and user-friendly job orchestration tool designed to streamline and scale test workflows. Utilizing a simple and intuitive YAML syntax, PCVS allows for flexible and efficient scheduling of tests based on massively parallel resources. Our retargeting model allows for the remapping of benchmark workflows, commonly associated with compilation and execution phases, across multiple environments. This approach has been used to build an high-quality MPI evaluation system, higlighting differences between API support among multiple implementations, demonstrating the potential of PCVS to assess API/ABI support across different implementations. Initially designed for validation processing, PCVS is versatile and can handle a wide range of use cases, from single test directory to large cluster-wide application stack. It should be viewed not as a test framework but as a coordinator between existing test bases and supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>LOFAR: FOSS HPC across 2000 kilometers</title>
        <subtitle>The unknown world of open source radio astronomy software</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe a large collection of 54 stations each with hundreds of
antennae collect a large amount of data for radio astronomy. These stations
separated by 2000 kilometers of distance combine at a core of 24 stations
in Exloo, the Netherlands and two HPC clusters in Groningen, the
Netherlands. Together this entire system is known as the LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses on the 400gbps datastream and aggregation across the
2000 kilometers distance between stations and how both a GPU and CPU cluster
translate these data into images. We will cover the open-source tools that
enable this processing, discover some of the history about our clusters,
gain insights into some of the pipelines and steps to do data transformations
and finally show you some of LOFARs current achievements and future
directions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Guidance on how to build and annotate containers for HPC</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While containerization revolutionized the delivery and execution of software, it introduces new challenges as the usual practice with one big software file-system with a subsequent &lt;code&gt;module load&lt;/code&gt; to rule all environments is not feasable with containers.
The talk introduces the 'HPC Container Conformance' Project which aims to provide guidance on how to build container images and how to annotate them so that end-users and system admins can integrate them in their workflows.
The talk also introduces the &lt;em&gt;MetaHub Registry&lt;/em&gt;, an OCI compliant container registry to serve  environment/hardware specific images and reduce overall complexity of herding all the container images. By using profiles when logging in MetaHub is aware of the context the image is going to be executed and picks the right image from previously pushed/configured container images. Centralising the logic of picking the right software variant (&lt;code&gt;module load&lt;/code&gt;) within the registry enables a series of enhancements to the user experience and a reduction in complexity which allows users and admins to focus on their science.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The LDBC benchmark suite</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We motivate and present an open-source benchmark suite for graph processing, created and maintained by the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC). We first define common graph workloads and the pitfalls of benchmarking systems that support them, then explain our guiding principles that allow for conducting meaningful benchmarks. We outline our open-source ecosystem that consists of a scalable graph generator (capable of producing property graphs with 100B+ edges) and benchmarks drivers with several reference implementations. Finally, we highlight the results of recent audited benchmark runs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Data processing pipelines frequently involve graph computations: running complex path queries in graph databases, evaluating metrics for network science, training graph neural networks for classification, and so on. While graph technology has received significant attention in academia and industry, the performance of graph processing systems is often lacklustre, which hinders their adoption for large-scale problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) was founded in 2012 by vendors and academic researchers with the aim of making graph processing performance measurable and comparable. To this end, LDBC provides open-source benchmark suites with openly available data sets starting at 1 GB and scaling up to 30 TB. Additionally, it allows vendors to submit their benchmark implementations to LDBC-certified auditors who ensure that the benchmark executions are reproducible and comply with the specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we describe three LDBC benchmarks: (1) the Graphalytics benchmark for offline graph analytics, (2) the Social Network Benchmark's Interactive workload for transactional graph database systems, and (3) the Business Intelligence workload for analytical graph data systems. For each benchmark, we explain how it ensures meaningful and interpretable results. Then, we summarize the main features of the benchmark drivers and list the current reference implementations (maintained by vendors and community members). Finally, we highlight recent audited benchmark results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected prior knowledge: specialized prior knowledge is not needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intended audience: developers and users of graph processing frameworks&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) capable of teraflop performance
double digit speedups over single core execution are possible.
An alternative application of GPU acceleration is quality up:
if we can afford to wait the same amount of time as on a single core,
then how much more accurately can we compute the same result?
A multiple double is an unevaluated sum of doubles and multiple double
arithmetic exploits the optimized hardware for floating-point arithmetic,
with predictable overhead and simple memory management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will present experiences with software package QDlib
(Hida, Li, Bailey, 2001) and the more recent CAMPARY software
(Joldes, Muller, Popescu, Tucker, 2016) on NVIDIA GPUs,
in particular the P100, V100, and RTX 2080.
Code to evaluate and differentiate polynomials at power series and
to accelerated the blocked Householder QR in multiple double precision
is used in the software PHCpack, publicly available at github,

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An AI that can lock you out of your own PC every hour or so, and only allow you back in when you did 10 pushups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounded like a good idea before I actually made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better way to learn about MLOps than over-engineering a pet project to a degree where Google can put it into production tomorrow.
Using a raspberry pi coupled with a camera / AI accelerator combo kit, I created a fully featured fitness overlord. The full ML pipeline was handled with ClearML, using a Google Pose Estimation model at its core, both open source ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will guide the listener through the journey of creating this overlord, from the specifics on the hardware to the fully automated retraining and deployment pipeline. Mostly the focus will be on the machine learning side of the project, the challenges that I had and how I was able to overcome them using open source tools and industry best practices around managing ML projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;High-performance computing (HPC) is often seen as antithetical to “reproducibility”: one would have to choose between software that achieves high performance, and software that can be deployed in a reproducible fashion.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;High-performance computing (HPC) is often seen as antithetical to “reproducibility”: one would have to choose between software that achieves high performance, and software that can be deployed in a reproducible fashion.  This talk will discuss how GNU Guix lets users deploy software optimized for the target machines while preserving provenance tracking and reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is HPC seen as antithetical to reproducibility in the first place? Maybe your cluster admins told you: if you want peak performance, you have to use the software stack that they themselves or the hardware vendors installed and tailored specifically to this cluster, and to recompile your code locally.  Your software deployment becomes tied to this machine and hardly reproducible elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by giving up on reproducibility, we would give up on verifiability, a foundation of the scientific process.  How can we conciliate performance and reproducibility?  Engineering work that has gone into performance portability has already proved fruitful, but some areas remain unaddressed when it comes to CPU tuning.  This talk looks into package multi-versioning, a technique developed for GNU Guix, a tool for reproducible software deployment.  We will show that it allows us to implement CPU tuning without compromising on reproducibility and provenance tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>LIBRSB: Universal Sparse BLAS Library</title>
        <subtitle>A highly interoperable Library for Sparse Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines and more for Multicore CPUs</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many science and engineering models reduce to problems involving huge sparse matrices -- matrices where most of the values are zeroes.
Such computations are resource-intensive (time, memory, energy), and much research was devoted into data structures ("formats") and algorithms leading to fast sparse matrix operations.
Yet, most such formats are highly specialized and seldom make it into a solid software package apt for general use.
The RSB (Recursive Sparse Blocks) data structure is a format that addresses performance concerns for current shared-memory multicore CPUs, while also avoiding dead ends in terms of usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LIBRSB library implements RSB with all the necessary operations to manipulate sparse matrices in most computations, in the most popular programming languages, and on many hardware platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview of the concepts behind LIBRSB and its main usage modes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Intended audience: Developers of Linear Systems Solvers based on Iterative Methods, or General Computing Packages.                        &lt;br/&gt;
Expected prior knowledge: Familiarity in any of C, C++, Fortran, Python, GNU Octave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We introduce the numba-mpi project, which offers access to the C language Message Passing Interface (MPI) routines from within Numba-JIT-compiled Python code. As a result, high-performance LLVM-accelerated Python code may use MPI communication facilities without leaving the "nopython" mode (still being usable, e.g. for debugging purposes, with the JIT compilation disabled). The numba-mpi API constitutes a thin wrapper around the MPI C API and is built around the Numpy arrays including handling of non-contiguous views over Numpy array slices. The package is implemented in pure Python and depends on numpy, numba and mpi4py (the last dependency is used at initialisation only). Package releases are available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/p/numba-mpi/) and Conda Forge (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/numba-mpi). Project development is hosted at Github leveraging the mpi4py/setup-mpi workflow enabling continuous integration tests on Linux (MPICH, OpenMPI &amp;amp; Intel MPI), macOS (MPICH &amp;amp; OpenMPI) and Windows (MS MPI). Auto-generated docstring-based API docs are maintained at: https://numba-mpi.github.io/numba-mpi. The project is in continuous development (size/rank, send/recv, allreduce, bcast &amp;amp; barrier available and covered by unit tests as of time of writing). We welcome feedback and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Running MPI applications on Toro unikernel</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Unikernels aims at improving the way single purpose systems are built with minimalist kernels that the user’s application compiles within. This results in deployments that require less memory, less disk, less cpu and less time to be up and running. Also, the whole system spends most of the time in the user application or doing IO for that single application thus cpu time is used more efficiently. In this presentation, we talk about the use of unikernels for High Performance Computing. We present a work-in-progress that aims at implementing the MPI standard on top of Toro, an open-source non-POSIX unikernel. In this work, we implement a library that conforms to the Open MPI implementation. This library relies on Toro API to implement the MPI functions. In particular, the library leverages Toro’s features like per-CPU memory allocation, cooperative scheduler, thread migration and inter-core communication based on Virtio. During the initialization, Toro creates one instance of the MPI application per core. Each instance is a thread that is migrated to the corresponding core and then executes without any interference. When applications are required to allocate memory, each core has its own memory pool from where memory is allocated. This allows us to keep memory allocation local, thus improving the way cache is used. Also, primitives like MPI&lt;em&gt;Gather() or MPI&lt;/em&gt;Scatter() that require communication between instances are implemented by relying on a new Virtio device named virtio-bus that allows core-to-core communication without locking. At the moment, we have implemented the following APIs:
- MPI&lt;em&gt;Gather()
- MPI&lt;/em&gt;Scatter()
- MPI&lt;em&gt;Reduce()
- MPI&lt;/em&gt;Barrier()
The goal of this PoC is to port benchmarks from the osu-microbenchmarking (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/) to compare with existing implementations. During the presentation, we present how this is implemented and we demonstrate the use of the current implementation by executing different MPI applications on top of Toro.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>MUST: Compiler-aided MPI correctness checking with TypeART</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the context of MPI (Message Passing Interface), our talk presents a long-standing collaboration between RWTH
Aachen and TU Darmstadt to further extend the MPI correctness checker tool MUST with memory allocation checking
capabilities in the context of MPI (communication) calls for C/C++ target programs. To that end, we developed the LLVM
compiler plugin TypeART. Both tools are open source and available under the BSD 3-clause license, see https://itc.rwth-aachen.de/must/ and https://github.com/tudasc/TypeART.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, MUST’s correctness checking includes errors that already manifest - segmentation faults or incorrect results
- and many errors that are invisible to the developer or only manifest with certain HPC systems and MPI libraries. MUST
works by intercepting MPI calls of a target application at runtime, allowing for bookkeeping of the current program state.
Thus, MUST can cope with the complex MPI semantics of, e.g., (a) collectives, (b) wildcards, or (c) datatypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of relying on intercepting MPI calls, though, MUST is unaware of the effective type of the allocated void*
buffers used for the low-level MPI API. To that end, TypeART was developed to track memory (de-) allocation relevant to
MPI communication. TypeART instruments heap, stack and global variable allocations with a callback to our runtime.
The callback consists of (a) the memory address, (b) the type-layout information of the allocation (built-ins, user-defined
structs etc.) and (c) number of elements. Thus, with TypeART, MUST can check for type compatibility between the type-
less MPI communication buffer and the declared MPI datatype. Our tools also handle derived datatypes with complex underlying C/C++ data structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Code instrumentation is the primary means for extracting fine-grained performance data from programs. However, special
care has to be taken to with regard to overhead management, as a full instrumentation can increase the runtime by orders
of magnitude. Careful selection of the instrumentation configuration (IC), typically via filter lists, is therefore crucial to retain
the performance characteristics of the original application. In order to give the user better control of what is measured, we
have developed CaPI, an open-source tool for the creation of low-overhead, user-defined ICs. CaPI relies on a statically
constructed whole-program call-graph as its central data structure, enabling the user to select functions based on the
context they are called in, in addition to function-level metrics. Currently, this call-graph is generated externally by tools
running on the source level. This can be cumbersome, especially when targeting large-scale scientific software.
To mitigate this issue, we are developing an approach that runs the analysis on the LLVM intermediate representation
during link-time optimization. Running during link-time also allows us to embed the result into the binary, improving the
workflow and usability of CaPI. In this talk we will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of link time generated call
graphs compared to source level generated call graphs, and show how statically generated information can be augmented
dynamically at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In high performance computing, package managers like Nix, Guix, Gentoo Prefix, and Spack are used to install applications and their dependencies. They allow multiple variants and flavors of the same package to coexist, by installing every package into a unique prefix directory that embeds a hash derived from the dependency graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This non-standard directory structure can result in increased startup time of executables, as the dynamic linker has to search through many directories to locate all required libraries. This is especially problematic in the context of HPC and shared filesystems, since many instances of the same executable may start in parallel, causing a "stat storm" on the typically slow filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk explores benefits and drawbacks of different solutions, and shows in particular how the Spack package manager solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Keeping the HPC ecosystem working with Spack CI</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Spack package manager is widely used by HPC sites, users, and developers to install HPC software, and the Spack project began offering a public binary cache in June of 2022.  The cache includes builds for x86_64, Power, and aarch64, as well as for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and Intel's oneapi compiler.  Currently, the system handles nearly 40,000 builds per week to maintain a core set of Spack packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping this many different stacks working continuously has been a challenge, and this talk will dive into the build infrastructure we use to make it happen.  Spack is hosted on GitHub, but the CI system is orchestrated by GitLab CI in the cloud. Builds are automated and triggered by pull requests, with runners both in the cloud and on bare metal.  We will talk about the architecture of the CI system, from the user-facing stack descriptions in YAML to backend services like Kubernetes, Karpenter, S3, CloudFront, and the challenges of tuning runners to give good build performance.  We'll also talk about how we've implemented security in a completely PR-driven CI system, and the difficulty of serving all the relevant HPC platforms when most commits are from untrusted contributors.  Finally, we'll talk about some of the architectural decisions in Spack itself that had to change to better support CI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing applications intended to run on high-performance computing clusters can be a painful process, especially when you do not have access to the resources you need. Sometimes you just want to check if you have the right compile flag specified, if the script you wrote actually works, or if your application can successfully use multiple cores. One way to test your HPC software is by &lt;em&gt;emulation&lt;/em&gt;; instead of wasting precious compute time on your bare-metal cluster, you use a micro-HPC cluster that provides the same functionality as the bare-metal cluster on a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the concept and implementation of an open-source testing framework that builds upon micro-HPC clusters. We will explore how a micro-HPC cluster can be brought up using Python and deploy core software such as identity management, shared file systems, and environment modules. We will also be exploring the transferability of the testing framework, such as how we can ensure that tests can both be run in CI pipelines and on local development machines, or how can use pre-existing frameworks such as pytest or unittest to run the tests. Lastly, we will discuss limitations of the testing framework and future work that can be done to improve its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk will demonstrate how doing less can result in doing more: how domain-specific data constraints may lead to dramatic speedups in serialization. There will be two examples: binary caching of numpy object arrays (Pandas) and generating json web responses from @dataclass-es. We will also cover the revolution of using C++17 in Cython, custom arena memory allocators based on mimalloc, and gory internals of CPython.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;pip install malware: it’s that easy. Almost all projects depend on external packages, but did you know how easy it can be to install something nasty instead of the dependency you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember classic typosquatting examples like goggle.com, but it’s now common to see malicious code hidden in spoofed or otherwise fraudulent PyPI packages or nested dependencies. Malware developers can also use techniques like starjacking to appear legitimate, so these unpleasant packages become even more difficult to spot. It’s estimated that over 3% of packages on PyPI could be using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk, you’ll know how to protect yourself when installing and updating dependencies and you’ll leave with a checklist to follow to help you stay safe in future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;So much of our knowledge is recorded as textual data. The knowledge is there, but extracting insights out of it is a challenge. Imagine the time you spend trying to get to that one piece of information that you know is buried somewhere in your piles of documents. In this presentation, we will approach this problem by building our own semantic search application in Python, using Haystack.
Haystack is an open source NLP framework and its key building blocks support a variety of semantic search pipelines. In this presentation, we will walk through one particular application of semantic search: question answering. We will also have a look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tasks semantic search enables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key building blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to leverage Haystack’s open source tooling to use the latest resources in NLP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>AMENDMENT Code reloading techniques in Python</title>
        <subtitle>Cold and hot code reloading, the different options, how they work and when to use them.</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While iterating rapidly on Python code, we want to see the result of our changes rapidly. In this talk, we will review the different techniques available to reload Python code. We will see how they work and when each is the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk replaces one titled "The future of Python's asyncio" that was due to have been given by Jonathan Slenders, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend as he has fallen ill. We wish him a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover both cold and hot reload techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold reload&lt;/strong&gt; techniques reset the application state between each reload. Examples include Django and Flask's autoreload tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot reload&lt;/strong&gt; techniques keep the application state despite the code changing. These include Jupyter kernels and 'reloadr' [1], an open-source module developed by the speaker to allow stateful hot code reloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMENDMENT: Please note that this talk replaces one titled "The future of Python's asyncio" that was due to have been given by Jonathan Slenders, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend as he has fallen ill. We wish him a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Realtime 3D Graphics on a MicroPython ESP32</title>
        <subtitle>Hacking the EMFCamp Conference Badge</subtitle>
        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is not really a "how-to" -- it's more of a "what-did"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent an unreasonable amount of time writing a software 3D renderer for an extremely small and low-power ESP32 device running MicroPython. I will talk about the problems I encountered, the optimisations I made, and the eventual contributions I was able to make back to the MicroPython project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you've been to other hacker conferences like EMFCamp or MCH, you may be familiar with the tradition giving attendees interesting hardware on a lanyard instead of a traditional conference badge. Attendees are encouraged to experiment with and hack on the device both at the conference and afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year at EMFCamp 2022, the conference badge was a USB thumb drive sized ESP32 device running MicroPython. It has a joystick, an accelerometer, the cutest little LiPo battery, and a lovely 135x240 pixel colour TFT display. It seemed like it would be a fun single-weekend exercise to write a little 3D renderer for it in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be a "fun" multi-weekend exercise, but I learned a lot that I'd like to share. I learned how to workaround problems in the tooling. I learned there were problems in the display driver. I learned about optimising Python. I learned how to write native MicroPython modules to rewrite some hot functions in C. I learned about optimising how the Python talks to the C. And I even learned how to contribute some improvements back to the MicroPython project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will bring the device with me, catch me after the talk to see it rendering Utah teapots up close.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a world of complex algorithms to recommend music, Calliope is a simple toolkit of ~6000 lines of Python that you can use to build different types of playlist generators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will touch on: open sources for music metadata, example playlist generators, and tools to speed up working with this kind of "small data".&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>DuckDB: Bringing analytical SQL directly to your Python shell.</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present DuckDB. DuckDB is a novel data management system that executes analytical SQL queries without requiring a server. DuckDB has a unique, in-depth integration with the existing PyData ecosystem. This integration allows DuckDB to query and output data from and to other Python libraries without copying it. This makes DuckDB an essential tool for the data scientist. In a live demo, we will showcase how DuckDB performs and integrates with the most used Python data-wrangling tool, Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk is catered primarily towards data scientists and data engineers. The talk aims to familiarize users with the design differences between Pandas and DuckDB and how to combine them to solve their data-science needs. We will have an overview about five main characteristics of DuckDB.
1) Vectorized Execution Engine,
2) End-to-end Query Optimization,
3) Automatic Parallelism,
4) Beyond Memory Execution
5) Data Compression. In addition, users will also experience a live demo of DuckDB and Pandas in a typical data science scenario, focusing on comparing their performance and usability while showcasing their cooperation. The demo is most interesting for an audience familiar with Python, the Pandas API, and SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Continuous Documentation for Your Code</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you document your code?
Imagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some code, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it and there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to onboard new team members,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to share knowledge,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It this talk I will show the difference between documentation types and will show a demo in the end of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you need to communicate with DBus in your application? Do you want a quick and easy solution? Are you confused by the DBus specification? Do you make typos in XML? Let me introduce you to the dasbus library and demonstrate some features and capabilities that might be interesting for your project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;DBus is a message bus system that provides an easy way of inter-process communication. It is widely used in the Linux ecosystem, but it can be a bit intimidating to work with. I was involved in development of DBus support for an operating system installer that required a fool-proof easy-to-use DBus library, so I have created dasbus. Dasbus is a DBus library written for Python 3.6+, based on GLib and inspired by pydbus. It is trying to be as Pythonic as possible and relies on exceptions, type hints and decorators with a strong focus on composition over inheritance to make its implementation fully customizable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Understanding what is happening in a large Python project stinks. Especially when you have a bug in production that cant seem to be reproduced in your dev environment. &lt;em&gt;Pyhton's Logging Enters Stage Left:&lt;/em&gt; Python's logging tools may not be the easiest to work with so lets walk through and understand together. To wrap things up we will see what it looks like to use a centralized log store for visualizing these logs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Will PyScript replace Django?</title>
        <subtitle>What PyScript is and is not</subtitle>
        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, through some examples and demos of PyScript, we will see how to use it - just include the CDN URL, understand that it is a frontend-only Python that runs on the browser and learn the fact that it can work with javascript in conjunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we will look at what is under the hood - Pyodide - which is a Python distribution for the browser. It is what is essential to power PyScript. We will discover what is the difference between using PyScript and Pyodide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will conclude what is already available in PyScirpt like which library you can run on PyScript and which ones are still yet to come. In the end, we will answer the question - Will PyScript replace Django?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for those who are curious about PyScript and the idea of running Python in the browser in general. We will assume no piror knowledge about it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Pyscript there are a lot of questions about what is it and how it works. Will it change how we do web development with Python? In this talk, we will go through what Pyscirpt actually is, and how it works (using compared Python libraries on Pyodides). We will also talk about why Pyscript is created - not to take over JavaScript or Django, but to give the rest of 99% of people access to Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will also showcase how to use PyScript with JavaScript and/ or Django, hopefully, to inspire Python web developers to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Outline&lt;/h2&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At FOSDEM19, Aleksei Akimov spoke about how Adyen migrated their docs to Grav. In 2023, we look back to see where this journey has taken us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 4 years, the company has grown 3x which led to a proportional increase in content and its users. The importance of knowledge sharing cannot be understated. Grav sits at the centre of internal and external knowledge sharing. This talk looks at our documentation deployment setup from a single Grav code base, the automation put in place to ensure content quality, the extensions we built to address user needs, and our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Creating a content pipeline with Antora</title>
        <subtitle>Using AsciiDoc content for the website and other downstream processes</subtitle>
        <track>Collaboration and Content Management</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For a project of a reasonable size, there's usually more than one source for the website that needs to be published. For several years, Antora is known as a site generator which pulls AsciiDoc content from multiple Git repositories at once. It publishes a static website where users find a navigation, online search and linked pages, with the option to group everything by component versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Antora made the leap to open its publishing process to plugins: They allow pulling information dynamically during the build process and forward the content not only to a static HTML site, but other targets like PDF as well. This talk outlines what is possible today with these extensions, and how it can be extended for custom needs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several open-source software projects like Fedora, Eclipse Che, Camel, Debezium and Couchbase use Antora. For developers it is normal to develop software in collaboration using their IDE and a version control system like Git. The same type of collaboration is possible when all documentation is versioned in a markup-format like AsciiDoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several examples will be from the Eclipse Che project which leveraged the Antora extensions in 2022. Additional examples show how to enrich the content with metadata and to use the information when building the site, and how to get feedback from the users of the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tribe is a collection of core libraries currently written in PHP that use MySQL JSON extensively. It provides a content structuring and storage framework. It has two main components - Types.json and Junction. Types.json helps configure a content structure, without having to work directly on MySQL tables. Junction is a CMS (dashboard), that auto-configures based on Types.json.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Opinionated content structuring so that collaboration is easier.
Self-hosted. Currently well-tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 servers.
Provides a robust and predictable URL routing system.
Integrity of data objects is of primary importance. Data can be moved from one "type" to another. Structure of the content is always stored with every data object, making each data piece meaningful in itself.
JSON:API v1.1 is auto-configured for all data stored.
Provides a protocol to mount multiple front-end applications on the same data-set.
It's been 3 years in the making, around 90 projects are running on this framework. These include web platforms, products, mobile apps and chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Online collaboration tools for document edition are the perfect fit to enhance the features of a Content Service Platform like Alfresco. This session explores the integration of Open Source alternatives like LibreOffice, OnlyOffice and Collabora with the Alfresco Platform. Ready-to-test deployments will be provided and demonstrated!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alfresco is an Open Source Content Service Platform (CSP) that provides document and content management features in a Cloud Native deployment. Online collaboration tools are the perfect addition to the platform when addressing document editing requirements. This session will explore different topics in relation to this integration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of the Alfresco features that helps Online Collaboration tools to work on a CSP deployment (Repository, Metadata &amp;amp; Content indexation, Rules and Automation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical description of the Alfresco APIs used for the integration (CMIS, REST API, Events API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review of different deployment scenarios including ready-to-test templates:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OnlyOffice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collabora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final recap on additional integration patterns to enhance collaboration experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Several years of pandemic spread influenced every branch. Document collaboration is no exception in this case. Lots of teams face certain difficulties: some users want to stay in home office and work remotely despite it’s now possible to get back to real office. Therefore, lots of groups became even more distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure effective teamwork in the current conditions, it’s important to choose right tools. In our session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll present an open-source project ONLYOFFICE and all the novelties over the year since last FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll tell you how to organize efficient and secure document collaboration for any team using open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Introduction to the Synapse Kubernetes Operator</title>
        <subtitle>A new way to deploy Synapse and its Bridges on Kubernetes</subtitle>
        <track>Matrix</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, attendees will get an introduction to Kubernetes Operators. We will briefly touch on concepts like CustomResourceDefinition and the Controller Pattern in Kubernetes. No prior knowledge of Kubernetes is necessary for following this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will next focus on the Synapse Operator. We will demonstrate its main features in an interactive demo. Finally, we'll talk about the next steps and the future of the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Containers are everywhere. Resistance is futile ! And Kubernetes has won the battle of container orchestration engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes Operators are a way to deploy and manage applications and their components on top of Kubernetes. As Operators are gaining popularity (browse https://operatorhub.io/ to discover some of them), why not building one for Matrix ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Synapse Operator contains the business logic for managing Synapse instances, as well as some bridges, on top of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come join us in discovering what Kubernetes Operators are and how they are built ! Then assist to a demo of the Synapse Operator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Have you tried to join a crowded room on Matrix on a young server where you are the first to do so ? It's... slow.
It will manage eventually but you can make your favorite beverage in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the Matrix and Synapse people has been at work this year to substantially improve that, and this talk will present you the details about it.
Our journey will begin with presenting the needed specs changes, and then go through the various implementation foot-guns that we had to dodge.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;matrixRTC allows real time voice, video and data channels to be established between groups of people over Matrix, but what happens when those groups get large? In this talk, we’ll explore how matrixRTC uses cascading foci (Selective Forwarding Units, Multipoint Control Units,…) to ease bandwidth requirements for clients by relaying through servers in a federated and decentralised way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I wanted a secure and convenient way to share baby photos with friends and family, so I used Matrix to create an app with a social network interface and end-to-end encryption underneath.  In this talk, I describe how we use Matrix rooms to represent human social structures, from loose disorganized circles of friends, to well-defined organized groups.  I will talk about what worked well, where we found some pain points, and what we did to work around them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted the security of Signal Private Messenger together with the convenience of Facebook.  So I created an app called Circles that uses Matrix as its server.  All posts are end-to-end encrypted, so even the server admins can't read what users post or look at their pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matrix, everything happens in a room.  So Circles uses Matrix rooms to store all of its posts.  We use Matrix rooms in two different ways to let users connect and share in an organic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we can use a Matrix room to store one individual user's own posts, similar to their "wall" in Facebook.  The user can invite other users to follow them by joining the room.  Followers can also post emoji reactions and replies to the room owner's posts.  In the app, a social "circle" consists of one such "wall" room belonging to the current user, plus similar "wall" rooms belonging to the user's friends.  For example, Alice's "Friends" circle might consist of her own "Friends" room, her buddy Bob's "Friends" room, and their friend Carol's "Friends" room.  The app hides most of the complexity of the multiple rooms and instead presents the user with a single unified timeline of posts collated from all the rooms in the circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we can use a single Matrix room to represent a social group (like a Facebook group) where everyone in the group knows each other.  All that is required here is to render Matrix messages as a timeline of "social" posts rather than as chat messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We estimate that building on Matrix saved us 18-24 months of development time for our first minimum viable prototype.  Overall the experience has been very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we did run into a few pain points.  These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decryption errors with the iOS SDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing two passphrases to enable secure server-side storage, or hoping that the user never loses their first device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems with the 3rd party identity server that we initially used for email verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No ability to post both text and media in the same message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No ability to give a new user access to the earliest encrypted posts in the room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions about server performance and scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To address #2 and #3, we built a new authentication service using the Matrix user-interactive authentication API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to upcoming improvements in the Matrix spec, including extensible events, rooms as profiles, and sliding sync.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Decentralized moderation is difficult. For privacy and federation reasons, no server and no server admin has access to all the data and all authorizations. Bots could have access to authorizations but how can you deploy then, trust them and how can you make sure that they also have access to all data?
In this presentation, we'll show some of the ongoing work on Mjölnir for All, an exciting project that aims to transform moderation on the Matrix network, without end-user configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The DB48X project aims at recreating an open-source implementation of Reverse Polish Lisp on modern calculator platforms&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP28C, and with it, a new programming language, "Reverse Polish Lisp" (RPL). This was arguably one of the most powerful programming languages ever introduced on a pocket calculator, and it continued well into the 2000's, with the HP50 series. RPL was initially designed for a machine with a 4-bit CPU and 2K of memory, soon upgraded to 32K. Some of the more recent calculators from Hewlett-Packard used ARM CPUs, but then only to emulate the original 4-bit CPU and run the older 4-bit ROM code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, several ARM-based calculator platforms support open-source firmware. This opens the possibility to revive RPL in a more modern environment. DB48X is an attempt at recreating RPL from scratch to run on such platforms. Even today, these machines remain minimalistic, with as little as 60K of free memory and less than 1MB of usable Flash storage, for example. This talk will present a design and implementation of a basic RPL runtime written in C++, but replacing the standard C++ object model with a compact, garbage-collected, byte-addressable representation of RPL objects. We will also dive into what RPL is, why it truly deserves the name "Lisp", and why it remains remarkably different from the Lisp most of us are familiar with. We will discuss some of the implemented and planned features for that new iteration of RPL, including built-in on-line help, taking advantage of high-resolution graphics, or making it as efficient as possible in "direct" (non-programmed) mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Guix Home is an exciting new feature of GNU Guix that enables you to
apply the same functional configuration style you enjoy from Guix
System to your own home directory!  If you've ever wondered how to
manage your dotfiles with Guix, this is the tool for you.  It even
works on all Guix-supported GNU/Linux distributions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll explain how it works and how you can get started with it
without fear of breaking your $HOME directory.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show you how to use the &lt;code&gt;guix home&lt;/code&gt; subcommand of Guix for user-level configuration management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss how to create an initial configuration, tweak it to taste, and how to find additional "home services" you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have time, I will briefly discuss how to write your own home services!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a free software developer, do you wish to move to your own fully self-hosted git hosting service? Are you unable to do so because you find the GitHub issue tracker and website building features too convenient and useful? Are you frustrated with free software issue trackers and git hosting tools that require too much setup? Then, tissue is the minimalist issue tracker and project management system you've been waiting for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tissue, you write issues as free-form text in gemtext files and commit them into the git repo of your project. tissue comes with an excellent Xapian based search interface that lets you search through these issues using very natural and powerful queries. tissue comes with an easily self-hosted web interface, and even helps you with building a static site to show off your project. State is evil. So, apart from the project git repo, tissue is stateless. The web interface does not require a database. This makes it easy to deploy, backup, and is at the right level of complexity for small free software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tissue is written in the delightful GNU Guile, if that's important to you!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
