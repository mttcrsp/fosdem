        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch in my spare time, and has grown over time to boast 600+ open-source plug-ins developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other projects. In this talk, I'll discuss how the Jenkins project and the community work, what the ingredients are, why they help you attract more developers into your projects, and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A short version of this talk can be found at http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/building-developer-community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my points are that (1) to create a thriving software project, one needs a community of developers, (2) to foster a community of developers, you need extensibility (as a means of not getting in their way and in the way of what they want to do with my software), and (3) you also need to make every step leading up to hacking as easy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, am the creator and the lead developer of Jenkins, which boasts more than 550 plug-ins developed independently by contributors from all over the world. So I'd like to think that I'm qualified to speak on this topic. I have been a speaker at numerous technology conferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free software seemingly enjoys large support from the public sector. Top level politicians from all corners of the European Union are expressing their support for open formats and open source software implementations, and more and more municipalities and local authorities start the painstaking course of migration. At the same time, this dedication does not translate into a larger scale dedication to reform the systems which create roadblocks for open and free source entrepreneurs. The patent and copyright systems seem as irrevocably broken as ever they were. What can we expect from the future, and how do we deal with the present?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OONI is the Open Observatory of Network Interference. We are working to create a peer-reviewed taxonomy for discussion surveillance and censorship, a free and open source software tool set and to produce open and freely available data for all.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the vision of the OONI project as well as discussing technical details of our tool, ooniprobe. ooniprobe is one of a few tools we produce for performing internet surveillance and censorship measurements. We are working to create a peer-reviewed taxonomy for discussion surveillance and censorship, a free and open source software tool set and to produce open and freely available data for all. Data discussed will include a detailed explanation of some rather interesting countries that the speaker has recently visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Isis' request, there is no published video recording of this talk, but you can listen to the audio recording.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Practical Security for developers, using OWASP ZAP</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Any application exposed to the internet will be attacked, either by automated tools or manually by individuals looking to compromise it and its users. Security should be considered throughout the development process, but testing for security vulnerabilities (penetration testing) is a key part of secure software development. This is a particular challenge for open source projects as most developers have limited security experience and often don’t have the funds to pay for external expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), an integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is completely free, open source and cross platform, as well as being a community orientated project that actively encourages participation. While ZAP is used by security professionals, it is also ideal for anyone new to web application security and includes features specifically aimed at developers. ZAP can be run interactively, but it also supports a REST API, making it ideal for including in a continuous integration environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon will show how ZAP can be used to find vulnerabilities, both manually and as part of an automated build.
He will also give an overview of some of the more advanced features, and explain how they can be used for more complex security testing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Keccak, More Than Just SHA3SUM</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the selection of Keccak as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition. This concluded an open competition that was remarkable both for its magnitude and the involvement of the cryptographic community. Public review is of paramount importance to increase the confidence in the new standard and to favor its quick adoption. The SHA-3 competition explicitly took this into account by giving open access to the candidate algorithms and everyone in the cryptographic community could try to break them, compare their performance, or simply give comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk the authors of Keccak will introduce and highlight the strengths of their cryptographic primitive and explain how it can benefit to the FOSS community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Keccak, as the SHA-3 standard, will coexist with the current standard SHA-2 hash function family, it is much more than just another "SHAxSUM" algorithm. Keccak relies at its core on a new construction, called the sponge construction, which allows for simpler and more flexible modes of use. The talk will illustrate this by giving various examples on how current software designs can benefit from this greater flexibility, e.g., for all the flavors of hashing, stream encryption, authentication, authenticated encryption and pseudo-random bit generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will also focus on the different aspects that make the design of Keccak open, from the open source implementations on various platforms to initiatives to keep encouraging third-party cryptanalysis, such as the KeccakTools cryptanalysis software and the Crunchy Crypto Collision and Pre-image Contest.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When dealing with free and open-source software, we have to work together with reporters, upstream developers and other distributions to protect end users from security threats. For distributions, it is a challenge to deal with a huge collection of software packages, both internally and externally developed, employing many different development procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk looks at best practices which emerged for vulnerability tracking. Tracking already reported vulnerabilities is only one aspect, however. We discuss tool-chain based hardening features (which can sometimes turn vulnerabilities exploitable for code execution into mere crashers), some remaining low-hanging fruits in this area, and more radical approaches for avoiding low-level vulnerabilities related to memory safety. Some of the APIs we provide are difficult to use, and we look at ways to detect API misuse statically, across an entire distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How do you build a comprehensive and coherent Identity Management System on Linux ? This is the question I started answering 7 years ago when I joined Red Hat, and that is still being worked on today. In this talk I will present a broad overview of all the aspects of Identity Management that need to be considered to have a full end-to-end solution, from the server components (Kerberos, LDAP, DNS, Management components, etc..) that are managed under the umbrella of the FreeIPA project to the client components (SSSD and utilities) and all the other hidden parts (like GSS-Proxy, Samba libraries) that are normally not easily visible, but that become needed once you get down to playing with the bits. The talk will go down into the technical details and the whys and hows of the whole architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the Fedora ARM Project and in particular the work we are doing to bring Fedora to emerging 64-bit ARM server systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fedora is a popular Linux distribution on desktop and server-class systems. The Fedora ARM Project brings Fedora to ARM-powered systems - both existing 32-bit and emerging 64-bit. We are presently engaged in a full bootstrap effort to the new 64-bit architecture. This talk will include a live demonstration of Fedora running on 64-bit ARM hardware along with a detailed description of the process of bootstrapping a general purpose Linux distribution from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Anykernel and Rump Kernels</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Operating systems</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce the concepts of the anykernel and rump kernels, motivate their existence, and show a few cool tricks that are unique benefits.  We will not go deep into technical detail -- basic knowledge of operating systems is enough to follow the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The anykernel is a new way of looking at kernel architecture.  Conventional models such as the monolithic kernel, microkernel and exokernel dictate the execution model for kernel drivers.  In contrast, the anykernel states that any of these should be possible as a runtime choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rump kernel is a lightweight virtualized driver execution environment.  Typically, OS virtualization means that the application execution environment is virtualized.  In contrast, the rump kernel is designed for ultralightweight kernel driver virtualization.  Benefits of using rump kernels include millisecond bootstrap times and a small memory footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A production quality implementation of the concepts is available in NetBSD 6.  The implementation lends itself to various use cases, such as isolating kernel drivers into separate servers on an on-demand basis and reusing kernel drivers in a library fashion such as for accessing file system images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a basic overview of the concepts and benefits, the talk will introduce recent developments.  An example of such is a script for building rump kernels for non-NetBSD platforms which allows NetBSD kernel drivers such as the TCP/IP stack to be leveraged on platforms beyond NetBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a demonstration, the NetBSD kernel FFS driver will be run in a browser.  This is accomplished by compiling the driver with a C-to-javascript compiler and running a rump kernel on top of a hypervisor provided by the javascript environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Open ARM GPU drivers</title>
        <subtitle>Where are we today, one year after the unveiling of the Lima driver.</subtitle>
        <track>Operating systems</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source 3D drivers for the ARM space are finally happening. This talk will cover the projects tackling the arduous, but highly pressing, tasks of creating these drivers, the current status of those projects, and the handful of highly dedicated and determined individuals behind them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When the Lima driver was presented at last years FOSDEM, it was a game changing moment. Before this reverse engineering project for the highly popular ARM Mali 200/400 GPUs was announced, the open source graphics driver world was fully focused on the three x86 market leaders only, and the huge ARM market was being completely ignored (from a graphics driver point of view). The Lima driver fundamentally changed this, and now open ARM graphics drivers are a hot topic, and several people have taken it upon themselves to follow the Lima example. While individual projects are of course in different stages of completeness, and few are directly useful at this point, they have made this goal attainable. They will be enabling proper open source operating system on what is now ubiquitous hardware, and they have already changed the perception and attitude of graphics vendors for ARM towards their main markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover several open source graphics driver projects for several ARM GPUs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARM's own Mali with the Lima driver, and some of its developers: Luc Verhaegen, Connor Abbott (present), and Ben Brewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Qualcomm Adreno with the freedreno driver, and its main developer Rob Clark (present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nvidia Tegra, and its principal developer of the open source 3D driver for it; Erik Faye-Lund (present).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vivante GC range: Wladimir J. Van Der Laan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broadcoms Videocore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imaginations PowerVR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This talk will finish with a demo round of the current capabilities of the Lima driver on a proper GNU/Linux system. Some time has been reserved in the X.org DevRoom for further demos and talks by the other open ARM GPU developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>Operating systems</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, the ARM support in the kernel has considerably evolved: usage of the Device Tree, introduction of the pinctrl and clock frameworks, introduction of multiplatform support, new code organization, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the speaker's experience of getting the support for the new Armada 370 and Armada XP ARM processors from Marvell into the mainline Linux kernel, this talk will detail the most important steps involved in this effort, and through this, give an overview of those changes and summarize the new rules for ARM Linux support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be useful to both developers willing to add Linux support for a new SoC, but also to the developers willing to better understand the ARM code base in order to port Linux to a new hardware platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk provides some insight how Wolfram handles the I2C subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is one puzzle piece which simply has to work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Linux ecosystem, maintainers are gatekeepers. They take the ultimate decision as to which patches are accepted and they are entrusted to lead their subsystem in a future-proof direction. Discussions and decisions are public via mailing lists, but what does an actual workflow look like? Are there any special tools involved? What equipment is used? What helps in handling difficult corner cases? How do maintainers collaborate? How much time does it take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk provides some insight how Wolfram handles this for the I2C subsystem, which is one puzzle piece of the kernel which simply has to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kids, Code, and cakes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to find a solid way to share your love for code with your children? We did too. So we launched Coding Goûter: a monthly event where kids and parents play with a variety of programming tools and languages. And eat cakes and candies :-)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coding Goûter is not a class, is not a lesson, and has no teachers: Kids and adults discover and learn together, from each others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have organized 10 Coding Goûters as of december 2012, most of them with a wide range of kid’s age – 5 to 14 – and constantly slightly more girls than boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding Goûter is a (mostly) monthly event where kids and parents play with a variety of programming tools, algorithmic games and puzzles, development environments, and languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Goûter' is French for a child’s afternoon snack or party, so we eat cakes and candies too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love code. We do it for pleasure, we do it for money, we do it all the time or just… very occasionnally :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are many to have learned to code when we were kids, or teenagers, or later, but in all cases we &amp;lt;em&gt;enjoyed&amp;lt;/em&gt; it. For some of us it’s now their job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we share the marvel and creativity of code with our children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard. We don’t really have time at home, because there’s always something else to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And school? Well, it’s mostly not good. At best, there is &amp;lt;em&gt;some&amp;lt;/em&gt; computer classes. But you know what? Classes are no fun. And it’s probably not even the best way to discover programming (Did you discover drawing in a formal class? I guess not.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something is missing, a time for kids and parents that feels like a hackathon or a coding retreat, where you can explore, meet, fail, start over. So let’s have fun together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding Goûter is not school-oriented, and there not a designated teacher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned by copying code, hacking around, we draw from these experiences to recreate an environment where learning happens organically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We let the kids show us the creative direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think demoing to others beats points or badges as a reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take our time, a Coding Goûter last more than 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not our kids’ teachers, so we just forgo the all lets-build-a-curriculum obsession :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Organizing quality software competitions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we describe an approach for organizing programming competitions that aim to reward software qualities such as readability, maintainability, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At my university we are considering the idea of organizing a software competition with the objective of promoting, beside programming ingenuity, the production of software of good quality, that is,  software that it is easy to read, maintain, modify, debug, ...,
Such qualities are, by their own nature, quite "fuzzy" and ill-defined, so measuring them in an objective and quantitative way is not easy.  In order to solve this problem we figured out an approach based on  a competition between "spoilers" that introduce bugs in the software and "counter-spoilers" that try to debug them.
Briefly, each spoiler is given a set of programs and s/he must modify them by introducing bugs, as subtle and difficult to find as s/he can.  Each counter-spoiler receives a set of programs and s/he must find the bug(s) in them as fast as s/he can.  Finally, every program is given to many different spoilers to get many different spoiled versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition turns out to be, actually, three competitions in one since we reward&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;ul&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;The best spoiler, that is, the one that introduces the most difficult to find bugs.&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;The best counter-spoiler, that is, the one that is fastest in finding the bugs&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;The best program, that is, the one that is most "resilient" to bug insertion.&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "untangling" of the times required for debugging into a measure of spoiler, counter-spoiler and program quality is done by using a statistical approach (that we plan to describe in detail in the talk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the talk is to describe in detail the technique, stimulate feedback from the community and, also, search for volunteers spoilers and counter-spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;and a way to create customized newspapers according to your favorite topics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we can use RSS feeds, Twitter, Google Reader, Yahoo Pipes or aggregators to keep up with news. Though those solutions do not guarantee data privacy and rather manage news by origin. The zone project proposes an innovative solution to overcome those issues using the power of Semantic Web and group related informations together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ZONE-project provides a new, innovative way to follow news. At its core, the system is aggregating news items from various RSS feeds. Using the power of semantic web we are able to efficiently tag &amp;amp; annotate each news. Those tags are the basis of filters. Filters allow users to see only news that are relevant.
For instance users can retrieve all news containing a tag, or on the contrary never see news containing specific tags. Basically it means that each user can create custom news feeds according to his interests.
Though it may be tedious for John Doe to build its own filters, thus it will be possible to exchange filters with other users, or read specific news feeds built by other users. This will enable users to create news group feed focused on specific topics such as technology, heath, industry, transport, agriculture, communication, environment...  No field can escape from the ZONE search and news feed mechanism!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Arduino is a development platform useful not only for amateur/hobbyist projects, but also for prototyping commercial solutions. Its modularity make easy the process of creating and evaluating concepts in a short space of time and with reduced costs. In this talk we are going to illustrate a development flow divided into three steps: the modular design, the prototype and the final product. The modular design intends to validate the main features of the product being developed, while the prototype has the goal of evaluating its performance. The two first steps allow us to validate the proposed product with reduced costs and reduceddevelopment time, as well as it helps reduce the need of making changes in the final product project in a later stage. To illustrate this process, we are going to go through the development of a GPS tracker with GSM communication made on top of open-source software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Programming and debugging Arduino in user space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing the Arduino simulator and C/C++ development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searduino is made to ease and speed up development for the Arduino boards. In short, with
Searduino you get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/C++ interface - use C/C++ to program your Arduino boards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makefiles - easy to use Makefiles for inclusion in your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand alone program - build your Arduino code to run on your local computer instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulator - run your Arduino code in a simulator to test it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulation API - write your own test cases in C/C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python simulation API - write your tests in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino example translation (not ready yet, but really close)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The authors of Searduino love developing code for Arduino. We love using Arduino and we believe that developing code for Arduino has been made significantly easier for not-so experienced developers. However, for some of us it is easier to develop code in our favorite editors and build and compile via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searduino was initially created to make it possible to automate the building of your arduino program and to do this outside of the Arduino IDE. Once we had the compilation and linking up and running we quickly noticed that it wouldn’t take that much to make it possible to turn your Arduino program into a program executing on your local computer. The writes and reads on pins in your Arduino program were ’translated’ in to reads and writes on stdin/stdout, which we used to create a simple simulator communicating via a pipe. We saw the potential of the simulator and decided to write a “proper” API for it instead. To make the simulator more usable for quick checks and for people preferring GUIs we started to write a simulator GUI in Python, so we added a Python extension to the simulator API. And here we are right now....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Vehicular traffic estimation through bluetooth</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lightning talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present a traffic monitoring prototype powered by a raspberry-pi that leverages on techniques such as the detection of signals as Bluetooth. Namely, signals spread by vehicles passing on the roadway are revealed by the battery powered boxes installed on the roadside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire system is proudly powered by only free and open source softwares, at the probe side upon a healthy OS level orchestrated by the Debian OS runs the bluetooth inquiring tool while at the server side the traces are gathered and analyzed by a python back-end developed with the web2py web framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the growing and serious issue as the traffic jam and the continued reduction of the budget that municipalities have to deal with a sane and open source system for monitoring the traffic trends could be a starting point not only for cutting the expenditure down but also to develop an homogeneous monitoring infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of developing our prototype based on signals as bluetooth stems from an interest of proposing an open source solution in the field of monitoring vehicular traffic. Moreover the idea is that the same solution can be applied by different municipalities without any significant effort in customizing and adapting the source code for their particular requirements.
Nowadays the bluetooth technology is available on several vehicular fleets, it is a matter of fact, it is widely used as the main in-car short range point-to-point communication standard for info-entertainment and phone headset. Its adoption in new vehicles is growing, as a result we expect that the number of cars monitored will increase in the following years. This positive growth can only strengthen the use of this technology.
In particular, based on empirical tests carried out in the city of Bolzano, the number of cars detected are at least the 25% of the total traffic flow, with an average of  30%, and peak of 43%. This figures are proof that it is possible and worthwhile to predict the traffic trends with this approach. In addition, by detecting bluetooth signals the system is not only able to project an estimation of the total number of cars passing through the monitored area but also to compute the travel time that a vehicle took to pass through two different places monitored by the probes. Namely, the former is an estimation chart generated as a function of the percentage of cars equipped with bluetooth while the later can provide input data for the so called in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) domain origin/destination matrix, which is used by traffic engineers to feed complex traffic simulation models that compute the traffic flows distribution over the entire road-network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A new C?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C2 is a new programming language that attempts to maintain the spirit of C, while considerably
 raising development speed. C2 also adds some great features and tools to C developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The C programming language has been around for a long time and C is one of the main 'open-source' languages that is used today. The C2 project attempts to build on the success of C, while keeping the spirit of C intact. C2 doesn't change the abstraction level (like C++/Java/etc), but it does change the way code is structured. This will greatly accelerate development cycles and at the same time increase run-time speed as well. One major change from C to C2 is the removal of the use of #include to access code in other files... This presentation at Fosdem 2013 will be the first ever to be given about C2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Using Lua to script the Linux kernel ABI</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using Lua to script the Linux kernel ABI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling Linux from a scripting language offers many advantages, in order to learn about how the operating system works, to build embedded systems and test environments and other uses. The ljsyscall project is a project that is working towards this aim using the Lua programming language to implement the Linux kernel ABI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Linux distributions do a very good job of “just working” out of the box, and hiding what actually goes on, in a complex set of largely compiled code. The original use case to develop ljsyscall came from trying to build small Linux container, virtualised or embedded systems that only needed to do one small thing, where a whole Linux distribution was overkill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also easy to understand what is happening with a scripting language as you can explore it in a REPL, see all the source, and run code easily with no recompile cycle. The code is also easier to understand than C for many people, with simpler string handling, garbage collection, and the provision of higher level data types as abstractions, eg for network interfaces. This makes it a good learning tool for what operating systems actually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code uses the LuaJIT foreign function interface (ffi) which makes it easy to understand as the Lua to C interface is very simple, as well as being very fast as it is just-in-time compiled giving similar performance to native C code. There are extensive tests, and the code works on x86, AMD64 and ARM processors so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code works and already exposes a lot of functionality, including system calls, signals, processes, containers, network interfaces and routing. It is like the busybox application in a scripting language. There is more to implement, such as support for more parts of the netlink protocol. It is being used in some projects now, but a wider audience could help contribute and improve it. You can use it like busybox, or for simple applications, or exploring the system. All code is MIT licensed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to:
- Give an overview of the cloudeebus architecture.
- Demonstrate how to use a DBus service in a web app or a Javascript lib with cloudeebus.
- Get feedback, users and contributors for the cloudeebus project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Linux Kernel with Dragon Wings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Lightning Talk introduces the LLVMLinux Project which is the collaboration platform for all efforts around compiling the Linux Kernel with the LLVM/Clang compiler infrastructure. We'll talk and demo what we have reached so far and what we plan to do next. What challenges we face in exchanging the compiler and what is already upstreamed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How to reliably evaluate storage systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blkreplay toolkit replays I/O-loads on storage systems on the block-level. This allows measurements and comparisons of storage systems under close-to-real-life conditions. With this tool deep insights into workloads and storage systems can be obtained easily.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The blkreplay toolkit (see http://www.blkreplay.org) was developed by 1&amp;amp;1 Internet AG in order to reproduce natural loads, recorded via blktrace in our data centers. It automates large laboratory projects, e.g. benchmarking comparisons of a wide variety of storage hardware and its multi-dimensional parameter space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will explain how the blkreplay toolkit works and discuss the block layer storage loads that have been recorded on various servers of a large ISP. The loads available cover a large range of applications including for example webhosting, databases and backup servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of these loads to commercial and open source / commodity storage systems has led to a deep insight into their behaviour. Some of which are surprising and eye-opening. Finally it will be shown that OpenSource based hard- and software systems can compete with commercial ones in many areas, provided that certain conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux system call tracing and injection API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracy is a library that offers cross platform event-based system call tracing and injection; fast memory access as well a few other neat features using ptrace. (Currently only with the Linux kernel)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tracy currently offers event-based system call tracing and (system call) injection on the ARM, x86 and AMD64 Linux-targets using the ptrace system call. Support for other kernels and architectures (mostly: *BSD) is planned. The aim of the project is to offer a uniform system call tracing (and injection) API on the popular UNIX platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracy can be used to create transparent (network) proxies, fault injection tests, secure user space jails and system call debuggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will discuss the implementation of Tracy and future plans with regard to new features, stability, and feasibility of cross platform tracing/injection code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pystemon is a multithreaded monitoring tool for PasteBin-alike sites written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation will quickly overview the main functionality of the tool and elaborate on interesting aspects:
- complexities when monitoring pastebin alike sites
- dynamic configuration by config file or variable classes to increase flexibility while keeping code small, readable and extensible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Secure messaging for everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocat is free software that aims to provide an open, accessible Instant Messaging environment with a transparent layer of encryption that works right in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cryptocat is developed by privacy advocates, for privacy advocates. Big Data providers such as Google and Facebook continue to amass gigantic amounts of personal information without providing any guarantee of privacy, while encryption remains largely inaccessible. This means that a lot of what you do online is not within your control, but rather susceptible to governmental or corporate interception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocat aims to bridge the gap for those who need encrypted communications that are easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fipes is a damn simple privacy friendly file sharing web application.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fipes try to solve the 949 problem [1] aka « why using usb keys is faster than using the network ».&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a web application which helps people to share files in a synchronous way.
We'll see how the project is by design focused on privacy and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Latest updates on a semi-automatic protocol reverser&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netzob is an opensource tool for reverse engineering, traffic generation and fuzzing of communication protocols. In 15 minutes, we'll present the latest improvements in this tool which allows to infer the message format (vocabulary) and the state machine (grammar) of a Network, USB, Files, API, IPC, (...) protocol. A short demo will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This short talk will provide some key assets in the field of protocol reverse engineering and details on the latest features. Netzob is suitable for reversing network protocols, structured files, process flows (IPC and communication with drivers and devices) and hardware flows (USB, …). Dedicated modules are provided to capture and import data in multiple contexts (network, file and process data acquisition). Once inferred, a protocol model can afterward be exported to third party tools (Peach, Scapy, Wireshark, etc.) or used in the traffic generation engine, to allow simulation of realistic and controllable communication endpoints and flows.
Netzob handles different types of protocols: text protocols (like HTTP and IRC), delimiter-based protocols, fixed fields protocols (like IP and TCP) and variable-length fields protocols (like TLV-based protocols). Join the devel team and participate in the creation of a unique tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the details of how BIND 10 provides DNS with a collection of cooperating processes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike BIND 9 or other DNS servers today, BIND 10 does not operate via a monolithic process that does everything. Instead, it uses individual processes to provide specific functions. This provides a number of benefits, such as scalability and improved fault tolerance and security, but requires additional software to hook it together, and has a few tricky corner cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>naxsi, an open-source web application firewall for nginx</title>
        <subtitle>A signature-less (or nearly :p) approach to web application firewalling</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A signature-less (or nearly :p) approach to web application firewalling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naxsi is a web application firewall for Nginx.
It is somehow different from most WAF, as it does not rely on signatures, but rather on a scoring system, in combination with a learning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal, during this lightning talk, is to give an overview of naxsi, from both the conception &amp;amp; development aspect (nginx is a fantastic software to work on), and from a usage/feedback perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Naxsi is an open source, high performance, low rules maintenance, Web
Application Firewall module for Nginx, the infamous web server and
reverse-proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its goal is to help people securing their web applications against attacks like
SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery, Local &amp;amp;
Remote file inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference with most WAF (Web Application Firewalls) out there is that it
does not rely upon signatures to detect and block attacks. It uses a
simpler model
where, instead of trying to detect "known" attacks, it detects unexpected
characters in the HTTP requests/arguments. Each kind of unusual character will
increase the score of the request. If the request reaches a score
considered "too high", the request will be denied, and the user will be
redirected to a "forbidden" page. Yes, it works somewhat like a spam system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it works on a learning mode (read white list). Set the module in
learning mode, crawl your site, and it will generate the necessary white lists
to avoid false positives! Naxsi doesn't rely upon pre-defined signatures, so it
should be capable to defeat complex/unknown/obfuscated attack patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Checkpoint/restore is a feature that allows to freeze a set of running processes and save their complete state to disk. Unfortunately, many attempts to merge such functionality to the upstream Linux kernel failed miserably, mostly for the code complexity reasons.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Checkpoint/restore is a feature that allows to freeze a set of running processes and save their complete state to disk. This state can later be restored and the processes are resumed exactly the way they were running before. This feature opens a whole set of possibilities, from doing a live migration to fast start of huge applications. Unfortunately, many attempts to merge such functionality to the upstream Linux kernel failed miserably, mostly for the code complexity reasons. That leaves the Linux community with a poor option of using the non-upstreamed kernel patches available from e.g. OpenVZ or Oren Laadan.
  OpenVZ kernel developers team found a way to overcome this inability to merge the code upstream, by implementing most of the required pieces in userspace, with a minimal intervention into the kernel.
  The project started about a year ago, but it’s already enough powerful. Now CRIU is capable to dump an LXC container with Apache and MySQL.
  This report will describe basic design of CRUI and and highlight some interesting parts of it such as dumping and restoring TCP connections. In addition it will describe some interesting usage scenarios such as rebooting to a newer kernel in a few seconds without losing state of processes and network connections.
  The report will be interesting for system and distro developers, advanced users, and anyone interested in containers, virtualization, and high availability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Rbridge concept was introduced by Radia Perlman in her famous paper "Rbridges: Transparent Routing".
Rbridges combine the transparency and self-configuration typical of the data-link layer to the packet routing that normally occur at the inter-networking layer. For this reason Rbridges have been defined as devices working at the &lt;em&gt;second and a half&lt;/em&gt; layer.
Vtrill is an implementation of Rbridges for VDE, a proof-of-concept of the Rbridge definition applied to virtual networking.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

I will also cover potential migration options for people who have CentOS-5/Xen stacks operational at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, a decision was made at their end to drop support for dom0 / host level support for Xen; The CentOS linux Distribution follows the upstream mandate as close as possible - and therefore we lost Xen support as well. Now, a small group of people have brought Xen/CentOS-6 together again to address the needs of users who had invested in Xen on CentOS-5 as well as new adopters looking at Xen as a KVM alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will cover the work done, the targets and deliverables for this Xen on CentOS-6 project and how this maps to the future of virtualisation on the CentOS platform.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Xen is a mature enterprise-grade virtual machine with many advanced security features which are unique to Xen.  For this reason it's the hypervisor of choice for the NSA, the DoD, and the new QubesOS Secure Desktop project.  However, while much of the security of Xen is inherent in its design, many of the advanced security features, such as stub domains, driver domains, XSM, and so on are not enabled by default.  This session will describe all of the advanced security features of Xen, and the best way to configure them for the Cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Live storage migration, one of the newest features introduced in oVirt, is the capability of moving virtual disks from one storage device to another without interrupting the guest operations. This presentation will cover in detail the entire low level design and implementation and all the technical challenges associated with them. In a virtualization world where the guest services cannot be stopped for maintenance, live storage migration is the best tool you can have.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Boxes is a GNOME 3 application that aims to make management of virtual and remote machines very easy. As an important part of that goal, Boxes not only makes it possible to create a virtual machine in a few clicks, given an installation media but it also gives user a choice to launch automated (AKA unattended) installation of operating system in question on it. Such an installation require minimum user input at the beginning and none during installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will start with a brief introduction to Boxes and automated installations with the help of live demos from an end-user's perspective. Next, application developers in the audience shall be explained how they can easily add support for automated installations in their applications using libosinfo. In the end we go behind the scene and see how support for new operating systems can be added to libosinfo (and therefore every application using it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Maintaining QoS in cloud computing requires host-level monitoring and policy enforcement. In order to be able to scale up large setups, a host-level agent is needed to supervise and dynamically handle the VMs resource consumption based on the SLA policy.
In this session we'll look at MoM, and get a in-dept view of it's integration with VDSM and functionalities. Participants will be able to get insights on memory overcommitment in hypervisors and the way memory balloon device is being used to achieve overcommitment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;XCP exposes a fully featured management API called XAPI. But today, there is no active open source project providing a web GUI which uses XAPI to it's full potential. Xen Orchestra was originally designed as web interface for Xen in 2009, and is undergoing a complete re-write to fill this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will examine interesting features of XAPI, such as events, pools etc. that allow easy administration of virtualized environment.
Then, we will see how these features fit into the Xen Orchestra architecture, which has been completely redesigned to reduce connections, bandwidth waste, storing of structured data, allowing persistence and so on.
Finally, we will show how we display all that information (ergonomics choices from an ergonomist). We will conclude quickly on how you can engage and contribute to the Xen Orchestra project and make sure it helps fulfil your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the direction paravirtualisation is taking in order to make effective use of the features which hardware now provides while still providing the security and scalability advantages of the PV approach. The talk will briefly introduce the evolution of virtualization techniques used in Xen and then introduce Xen's new approach to virtualization as used by PVH and in Xen's ARM port, both of which will be features in the upcoming Xen 4.3 release.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Xen Hypervisor was built for the Cloud from the outset: when Xen was designed, we anticipated a world, which today is known as cloud computing. Today, Xen powers the largest clouds in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xen originally pioneered the use of paravirtualisation (PV) in order to get the most out of contemporary hardware. Since then hardware vendors, including Intel &amp;amp; AMD in the X86 space and more recently ARM, have introduced hardware extensions which help to solve some of the hard virtualisation problems and which can bring some benefits over pure paravirtualisation and pure hardware virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The PTXdist build system recently had its 10th anniversary: time to look
at the state of the project and the new features which have recently
been developed by the community. The highlights of the last year are a
new image generation mechanism, improved systemd support, running on OS
X, the split up of runtime and build time dependencies, the start of
SELinux support and of course a lot of package version bumps and cross
build patch mainlining all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of hardware ptxdist is able to cover is demonstrated with
BSPs on quadcore Cortex-A9 with 1 GHz+ and on Cortex-M3 with 48 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for developers who need to integrate Embedded Linux
systems, as well as for developers working on other cross build systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year Lars Wirzenius presented a keynote on  "Re-thinking system and
distro development"[1]. A team of engineers at Codethink have now put
together a concrete realisation of these concepts, combined with real
life experience of existing embedded and distro build systems. The
Baserock embedded build system is now ready for real world use. We will
explain the design of Baserock and demonstrate it in action.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Qt and QML are open source technologies which enable crossplatform development.
This presentation demonstrates how Qt and QML can be used to create modern mobile
applications and operating systems using open source technologies and tools such as
the Mer project, Nemo Mobile, Qt Mobility, Qt Creator and Sailfish SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a showcase - the presentator shows how to create a photo gallery application, using Qt Creator,
Qt, QML, Qt Mobility and how to add in a custom layer to fit in the Sailfish UX with a few simple steps.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance ) technology allows users to seamlessly exchange, stream and synchronize media content between their various devices.  DLNA enabled devices are becoming ubiquitous in the modern home.  There are a number of existing open source projects that can be used to take advantage of the DLNA functionality offered by such devices.  This presentation will provide hands-on examples of how these open source projects can be employed and tailored by users to meet their specific needs.  There will be demonstrations of the standard DLNA use cases, explanations of the various DLNA APIs, including examples of their use, and the live creation of DLNA enabled applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OMA-DM is the standard Mobile Device Management protocol used by mobile phone operators to remotely administrate their users’ devices (settings provisioning, diagnosis, updates, etc…). After an overview of this protocol, we will present you libdmclient, an open source implementation of the client-side of OMA-DM. Written in portable C code and licensed under APACHEv2, libdmclient can be easily integrated on any cellular device. Its most interesting  feature is a plugin system allowing a dynamic DM tree.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;codebender is an open-source online IDE for Arduino developers, makers and engineers, which incorporates most of the advanced development tools you would expect in a traditional IDE and brings them to the Arduino. On top of being a very strong and easy to use alternative to the Arduino IDE, codebender also offers a number of collaboration tools, like cloning a project and sharing code and ideas between your team and other developers. We will show you how it works, and how you can use it to increase your productivity and share your work with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Doing package maintenance and software developemnt in a consistent way
accross a distribution is not always easy. Debian has long history of
maintaining packages in different version control systems. Here is a
proposal to use some practices in using Git to maintain RPM packages in git
by utilizing the git-buildpackage tool. The tool originates from Debian but
now has an experimental support for RPM, too. Git-buildpackage supports the
workflow of regular developers, package maintainers as well as
release/integration. Features include importing existing RPM packages to
git, building packages, importing new upstream versions, changelog
generation,
tagging and more. This talk gives an overview of the tool: how to use it in
daily work and also how to utilize it in the backend build infrastructure,
e.g. Jenkins/Hudson or the OpenBuildService.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is designed for developers and users of other Linux
distributions to gain an understanding of the Gentoo approach and
philosophy to package management. The goal isn't to get people using
Gentoo but rather for attendees to walk away thinking about how they
might be able to apply that to their own distributions or other
projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We'll cover how the package manager (Portage) works, what packages
(ebuilds) look like, our focus on ease of use for package authors, how
we've iterated on our package format over time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;lmonade is a light-weight meta distribution of scientific software,
based on Gentoo prefix, that can be installed without administrative
rights on Unix based operating systems. It creates a uniform
environment for development to simplify code sharing and distribution
especially when complex dependencies are involved.  This platform
enables researchers to build on existing tools without fear of losing
users to baffling installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain the motivation, design criteria and architecture
of lmonade with a summary of future plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  Hardened since last year, how do they work and which are our objectives
  as a project for the incoming year.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The LinuxonAndroid project was created at the start of last year, with
the goal to bring Linux based distributions to Android devices.
Primarily this has involved creating an Installer app and running
Linux on top of Android using chroot, while this is not by any means a
new idea LinuxonAndroid aims to support a range of Linux distributions
and support as wide a range of devices as possible.
Currently the project has over 800 different known working device set
ups (through user testing) and a user base of over 40,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will also cover a second project that uses the
LinuxonAndroid project as a base, SlapOS on Android. This project aims         &lt;br/&gt;
to use the SlapOS software (slapos.org) running within Linux on
Android devices allowing your android device to become part of your
Cload IaaS, give you the ability to have full control from your mobile
device!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Embedded systems need to be provisioned with a root filesystem
populated with a collection of packages, much like servers. However,
some requirements are slightly different. For example, it is important
that the complete filesystem image of an embedded system can be
reproduced exactly.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces buildroot as a distribution for embedded systems,
and compares it with using Debian/Emdebian or derivatives. As usual,
neither approach is perfect in all situation, but this talk will help
you selecting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Bootstrapping Debian-based distributions for new architectures</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Source packages in Debian based distributions make two assumptions: that
they are always compiled natively and that the full distribution is
available during compile time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These assumptions conflict with the
requirements during a port of a Debian based distribution. Some source
packages must be cross compiled for a minimal build system from which
the rest can be compiled natively. Since the full distribution for the
new architecture is not yet available, dependency cycles have to be
broken during cross as well as native compilation. As support for either
is not yet part of the source package description, porting was so far a
long, manual and error-prone process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to develop tools and techniques that make the process
of bootstrapping Debian based distributions for a new architecture from
scratch automated, repeatable and deterministic. Starting off from zero,
a minimal build system is cross compiled. Through native compilation and
breaking of build dependency cycles, the rest of the distribution is
built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the current status, the techniques and algorithms
used as well as future developments of these tools and what is missing
in Debian to make bootstrapping easier in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping a new Debian port of 18,000 source packages is always a
massive job, and on average happens every year.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year it's arm64.
This talk covers how such a port is done, and the work of the last two
years (on multiarch, cross-tools, dependency-anaylsis tools and
packaging infrastructure) to make this a repeatable and largely
automated process, rather than an epic labour of hackery and bodging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It covers specific issues of the arm64 port, such as no hardware
existing yet, and the current state of play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since 10 years the Debian Med project tries to attract developers and
  users of Free Software in the field of medical care and
  microbiological research &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; the Debian distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The strict
  approach package everything for official Debian and relay completely
  on the Debian infrastructure as so called "Debian Pure Blend" has
  turned out as very successful and enabled a constant growth regarding
  the number of packages in this field but also in the number of
  developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  The talk will stress either the consequences to stick into a
  distribution (there are similar projects in Fedora and SuSE) or to
  be an example for other sciences how to reasonable attract scientist
  into your team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;UOA is an accounts and authentication framework for Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, based on the core accounts-sso project which was first developed for MeeGo and used in the Nokia N9: http://code.google.com/p/accounts-sso/&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Above the core is the UI layer, including a settings panel applet and common authentication agent, providing the user interaction to the underlying framework: https://launchpad.net/online-accounts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cover a variety of topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to some basic terminology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-level overview of the Online Accounts framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstration of UOA integration in Shotwell, Unity and Empathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary of integration points for application developers, including addition of a new authentication plugin for an online service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current and future developments in the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to split the talk roughly equally between developer and user-oriented topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In many cases, we create software to solve our own problems: missing functionality in a tool, a tool that we believe doesn't work as well as it should, or the very lack of a tool that does what we need. If we're our own users, things are quite obvious. But what about everyone else? How do we know what our users need? Isn't it best to ask just them?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, you will learn why asking your users for what they want isn't always helpful, which do-it-yourself techniques you can use to understand their needs, how to make sense of the data you collect, and how all of this translates into the development of better features. We will discuss how this knowledge can fuel your decisions, delight your users, and influence your way of working in a distributed team of developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In an analogue way to traditional hand-drawn sketching, we can sketch interactions and experiences when creating software solutions. These quick and inexpensive sketches are not only an invaluable tool for generating and exploring new ideas: they are also a great way to communicate initial design decisions and involve more people from the community in the design process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will start by defining sketching and positioning its role in a general design process. It will then present a number of techniques than may be used to sketch interactive solutions, ranging from simple pen and paper to Free SW tools and frameworks. Several examples of real-world work from academical and Free SW communities will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

CMake has been in development for over 12 years now, and has continually improved over time. There have been many improvements that make complex tasks easier to implement. Alex and Bill will cover the important features and discuss the most efficient ways to use them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will be relevant to both those who have used CMake for years, and for new developers wanting to understand how best to construct a cross platform build system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework that caters for a whole range of multimedia needs, whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimedia middleware; embedded systems, desktops or server farms. It is also cross-platform and works on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, OS/X, Windows, iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In September 2012, GStreamer 1.0 was released, the next generation of the rather successful GStreamer 0.10.x API series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is a high-level overview of what's been happening in the world of GStreamer as of late, with a special focus on the state of GStreamer 1.0, latest developments and upcoming features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A lot of performance-oriented work has been done in the lower levels of the GNOME/Linux stack. Numerous kernel/udev improvements combined with the creation of systemd have helped a lot. However, as things stand, GNOME 3 is not snappy. The startup time of GNOME, the launch time of GNOME applications, and the rendering libraries themselves need work in this regard. We need to start being as obsessive about speed as web browsers are.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this talk is to highlight the parts of the stack that the speaker feels are most critical to this venture, and propose possible solutions to the problems of improving the performance of the stack, keeping it fast, and motivating authors to keep such things in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the session we will talk about WebKitGTK+ new release and plans. The new WebKit2 API is going to be stable very soon, we will explain the differences, new additions and current situation of the API in more detail and we will show how to embed and use the new widget. We also will explain the multiple features we have added in the last year (accelerated compositing, gstreamer 1.0, networking, etc.) and the roadmap for the next year.  Also as usual we will add nice demos.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk should be interesting for embedders because new WebKit2GTK+ API should be used in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That human could be a team member who never interacted with the code before, your pair while you are writing the code, or yourself months or days later. Using System Metaphor and BDD (aka TDD done right) highlights the story telling that is intrinsic in this way of developing. We will cover some examples of how to apply this and what you might find happens as a result.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce Calabash, an open-source technology for automated acceptance testing of Android and iOS apps, providing a hands-on example of cross-platforms testing using Cucumber and Calabash.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Calabash is an open-source technology for automated acceptance testing of Android and iOS apps. Calabash consists of libraries providing advanced automation technology to iOS and Android. Calabash supports BDD using the Cucumber tool. With BDD, specifications are written in the natural language of the application business domain, and the cucumber tool can execute those specifications as automated acceptance tests on Android or iOS devices or simulators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The software that runs Wikipedia, named MediaWIki, is tested in the open just like Wikipedia itself. This talk will cover how MediaWiki is tested, along with mistakes and successes made along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/qa-browsertests"&gt;The code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wmf.ci.cloudbees.com/"&gt;Jenkins jobs&lt;/a&gt; are visible to everybody. Only one file
with passwords is hidden. If you are interested in contributing, you will
learn how to &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Groups/Proposals/Browser_testing"&gt;get involved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will mention one pattern, &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects"&gt;page object&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of tools: &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rvm.io/"&gt;RVM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/"&gt;RubyGems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cukes.info/"&gt;Cucumber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.org/"&gt;Selenium
WebDriver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://watir.com/"&gt;Watir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gembundler.com/"&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cheezy/page-object"&gt;page-object gem&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/"&gt;RubyMine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/"&gt;CloudBees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://saucelabs.com/"&gt;Sauce Labs&lt;/a&gt; and
probably a few more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to have a few reference implementations of open
source test automation projects available to everybody. This is our
contribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing network stacks requires a fair amount of configuration to be done on multiple machines. In this presentation, we would like to introduce a tool we have been working on for the last couple of months. Our main goal is to make networking tests and reproducers as automated and portable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we would like to introduce a tool we have been working on for the last couple of months. Our main goal is to make networking tests and reproducers as automated and portable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing network stacks requires a fair amount of configuration to be done on multiple machines. The configuration itself is a part of the test. However, it is often highly dependant on the environment and unfortunately, when the environment changes (due to move to a different hardware/site, changes in the addressing, or simply updates of the operating system) the configuration often breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With LNST, we try to overcome these problems of transferring network configuration between different environments. We will demonstrate the ideas and the concepts we are working with, as well as the features that are a part of Linux Network Stack Test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As your product grows the number of tests will grow. At one point, the number of tests overwhelm the number of servers to run those tests, developer feedback becomes slower and bugs can sneak in. To solve this problem, we built parallelization into our Jenkins build pipeline, so we only need to add servers to keep overall test time down. In this talk, I'll cover how we did it and what came out of it in terms of pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As your product grows the number of test grows. At Tradeshift, we develop code in a test-driven manner, so every change, be it a new feature or a bug fix, includes a set of functional tests driven by Selenium.
At one point, it started taking too long to run all of our tests in sequence, even when we scaled capacity of test-servers to make the individual tests run faster. When tests are slow developers don’t get immediate feedback when they commit a change and more time is wasted switching between tasks and different parts of the code. To solve this problem, we built parallelization into our Jenkins build pipeline, so we only need to add servers to make our test suites run faster and keep overall test time down. In this talk, I'll cover how we did it and what came out of it in terms of pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Continuous Packaging Pipeline</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Testing and Automation</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I describe a pipeline for scripting the build process of custom system packages integrated with a continuous integration system – from Git repository through the CI build server to the Apt repository available to client systems&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You know you can't rely on your OS distribution's packaging for critical dependencies of your project. The release cycles never align; you're either stuck with a hopelessly outdated version of the Web server, or forced to do incompatible upgrade of the database at the worst possible moment – or both. You need to have it under your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of many ways to do it, from building full-system images to compiling stuff directly on the server, building system packages is known to be The Proper Way. It lets you leverage much of the knowledge and mechanics built into your OS. You integrate with the distribution, but you're not at the whim of its maintainers and release cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, building and distributing packages is something of a black art. The Debian Policy Manual PDF has 103 pages without even starting to describe the tools. I just want to package and install Logstash for myself, not have it integrated into Debian!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I describe a pipeline for scripting the build process of custom system packages integrated with a continuous integration system – from Git repository through the CI build server to the Apt repository available to client systems. I am showing how to sanely keep up with upstream projects and manage patches. I talk about sharing and reusing packaging scripts. I also briefly touch the topic of full stack packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The described toolchain is built on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/"&gt;fpm&lt;/a&gt;, Rake, &lt;a href="https://github.com/3ofcoins/metarake/"&gt;Metarake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/3ofcoins/evoker/"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;, Vagrant, Git, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/3ofcoins/vendorificator/"&gt;Vendorificator&lt;/a&gt; - a yet unfinished utility which I plan to release as usable beta in January. While I am using the pipeline with Debian and Ubuntu, the toolchain is flexible and easily adapted to other environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After discussing the shortcomings of the current approach, we look at ideas for alternative visualisations and start defining requirements. This talk does not claim to have all the answers; It is a call for action, to seek help from the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Collaborative meeting between Jenkins developers and potential contributors to discuss the project. Since it's Jenkins' second birthday, we'll also have as birthday toast!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last year, we had an informal gathering of developers in a cafeteria to discuss the next steps in the UI enhancements. It was a great use of the face-to-face time, and it drove the next few months for development and produced concrete results. I'd like to do the same this year, but in more comfortable environment. So I'm proposing that as a "talk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not going to be in a standard presentation format, where one person talks and others listen. Instead, this is meant to be a conversation between the Jenkins developers that are present (as well as those who are interested in becoming the contributors.) To structure an hour, we'll pick a topic or two well in advance and ask people to bring mini-presentations, if it helps. I need to discuss this with the community for exactly what those topics are, but ones I'm thinking about are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UI improvement round 2
Review of what hasn't been done in round 1, some of the current stalled efforts, and re-prioritize
what to work on in 2013 (and hopefully solicit volunteers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile and CI, state of union
Many of the developers of the key Jenkins plugins for mobile development will be in FOSDEM. I'd like
to put them all in one room, among users, and have them go wild about what should be possible, and
where the missing links are. We'd like to discuss what the core can do, or what the vendors (such as
Google and Apple) should be doing, and who knows, maybe they might listen!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating Jenkins QA
The Jenkins user community survey revealed that the quality and bug fixes is the most important priority
for users. We can review the current (some stalled) efforts, and prioritize what to work on in 2013
(and again, hopefully solicit volunteers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even though this is primarily focused to have existing developers talk to each other, I think seeing the Jenkins project in action has benefits to users as well --- after all, all of us were just Jenkins users before they became Jenkins developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary inspiration for this talk is the various security issues I have discovered in web applications (BOSH or otherwise) over the past years. This was originally meant to be a short length discussion at the Summit, but I was encouraged by various folks to do this at FOSDEM as the talk can appeal to a broader audience. The talk is developer oriented. Most of the ideas would apply to displaying any untrusted user provided content in a web-based environment, even in applications which are not BOSH based.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A description and demo of the Conference Bridge extension (cobri), which enables an XMPP client to export
the RTP relaying aspects of a video conference into the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Video Conferencing is generally a costly and resource consuming affair.
Lately however, increasing bandwidths have driven a shift away from
video mixing and toward RTP translation/relaying. In other words: rather
than mixing it, just send it all over the network. Skype video
conferencing and Google hangouts are both examples of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a bridge that is capable of handling that kind of RTP relaying
can be very inexpensive and one can even do it on most modern
desktops/laptops. The problem with doing it is bandwidth: few Internet
connections would allow streaming video to five or six different
participants in the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conference Bridge extension (cobri) allows an XMPP client to export
the RTP relaying part into the cloud, run it as an XMPP component and
control it through a bunch of IQ commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is about presenting the "cobri" extension and the sample
implementations in Jitsi and Jitsi Videobridge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Being the most relevant protocols for realtime communications it stands to reason that interoperating between SIP and XMPP has gains to both. I spent most of 2012 implementing such a gateway and while the xmpp-sip drafts helped a lot there were gaps that needed to be filled. I'll walk through the implementation decisions and challenges we found along the road.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An explanation and demo of device pairing, remote login, and intelligent packet
routing for splitting a media session across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine large public displays at metro stations that you could use to
temporarily play a smartphone game on it; or presentation hardware that
automatically shows your slides when entering the meeting room. The approach
presented includes device pairing, remote login and intelligent packet
routing for splitting your session to multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides public devices we support pairing personal devices as well. Let’s
say you have a desktop computer, a smartphone and a tablet all connected
using different resources; you can use them in parallel as messages are
synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all about SASL, OAuth, SIFT and Message Carbons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The webinos project has investigated the use of XMPP as its messaging protocol. Part of this effort was presented last year during FOSDEM. Especially in the area of large scale (‘massive’) service discovery progression is made. We present a qualitative and quantitative comparison between our webinos-specific XMPP extensions and other M2M paradigms. Included is a sneak preview of our upcoming scientific paper on this subject, as well as a Proof of Concept that demonstrates the webinos approach.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is a very effective communication tool, increasingly used in advertising today in order to build customer loyalty, and echoes the need of all humans to be entertained. Storytelling is a perfect tool for FLOSS projects, because it creates a sense of ownership for members of the project - even for those less involved - and therefore helps in growing the community. The presentation will offer an overview of basic storytelling techniques, and their application to FLOSS projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

We have investigated marketing and communication strategies of several FLOSS projects, from large software companies, SMEs and an Communities. The survey will be presented interactively, by asking to the attendants their experiences in order to increase the case studies and help FLOSS projects to promote and advertise their FLOSS products in the most effective way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Your project is awesome, so where is everybody? "Messaging" may sound like marketing-speak, but the term is from the world of non-profit organizing. How do you attract more people when your goal isn't all about the money?  Messaging starts with relatively easy stuff like your elevator pitch and an FAQ and becomes more advanced when you start thinking strategically about fighting negative stereotypes, finding your niche and constantly soliciting feedback. This talk is for people who are interested in refining their message and more effectively sharing their excitement about the free software movement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Personas were made famous by Alan Moore in "The Inmates are Running the Asylum", a seminal book on user interface design for computer programmers. They have been used for decades in the marketing industry to help target specific market segments with ads and products. Personas help you frame feature discussions while developing your software, guide your communication and conference strategy, and ultimately help you to have a more popular, better project. This presentation will cover the basics of: What is a persona? How do I come up with one (or several) for my project? What can I do with them?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gamification is a hot topic these days. It is the art of wrapping game mechanics like badges and levels and leader boards around stuff that isn't a game, harnessing people's natural affinity for fun competition into engagement. Services like Nike+ have proven that gamifying health and exercise behaviors can create strong incentives, make a healthy lifestyle more fun, and improve players' well-being. So, can gamification work for developers and their engagement with FLOSS? Can projects encourage contributor participation with achievements, comparisons, and incentives? Or does even friendly competition sour the cooperative ethos of FLOSS communities? Do developers really want to keep score and track their achievements? This interactive talk will present a few case studies of how gamifying FLOSS participation might work to get ideas going.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Following modern practices for software development and community management requires a plethora of tools, from source code handling to means of communication. Every tool has its purpose, and is necessary for things to run smoothly. Discarding any of them from the workflow is not an option. Yet, keeping track of everything can be overwhelming, especially for new members of your community who have to learn not just the internals of the code, but also the chock-full of tools around it, and the rules associated with each of them. In this talk I’ll quickly explain how a development wiki works. I’ll then present our wiki-centered infrastructure, which brings together SCM repository, mailing lists, issue trackers, IRC/XMPP channels, and offers simple solutions for blog and forum hosting, voting, extensions hosting, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

In this talk, Robyn Bergeron will discuss some of these processes, how they can be used in open source software project management, with a focus on those best suited for communities with participants distributed throughout the world. Best practices for encouraging transparency and collaboration will be highlighted, as well as ensuring that key project elements outside "just the code" are represented throughout the life cycle of an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free software provides many excellent advantages for its users, but many people remain unaware or misinformed about its potential. Free software activists can repurpose strategies used in more traditional community organizing to build our movement. This talk addresses some of the larger issues of perception and messaging and then drills down into very specific tactics for growing your free software group or project, with particular emphasis on how to diversify the type of participants you attract, build leaders and inspire loyal contributors. This talk is for project leads, user group organizers and anyone else who considers themselves a free software activist.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Starting from real examples of exciting and successful communities, it is demonstrated that the first priority is to manage evolution: focus the attention on development and balance of knowledge, networking and facts in the whole community at different levels of communication. Then, there is a proposal for a best practice: show the big picture and involve a few people that understand the project and believe in it, asking feedback; create a physical/virtual place where it is easy to "get the facts" and "get the knowledge"; tell users criteria to discuss and improve knowledge and facts; propose few channels and ask for agreement; propose referrers and let them be judged by community; define how a user can become a referrer; make efforts to give referrers role to users who demonstrate results (provide facts) in interest of the community and the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Headed to your annual developer conference and there’s a contentious topic on everyone’s mind? Wondering how to get past the airing of grievances into a useful discussion? In this talk, Lydia Pintscher and Leslie Hawthorn will explore facilitation techniques to use during community wide discussions. Drawing on the principles of open space technology, they will explore several methods for achieving consensus while still having fun, including: Spectragrams, Dot-o-cracy, Post-It Mind mapping. The talk will be accompanied by live demos of each technique. Participants who wish to learn more about the topics to be discussed in advance of the presentation may wish to visit the Aspiration Technology wiki for more details: http://facilitation.aspiration.org.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Universities are the source of huge amounts of lines of code and also of graduates that, later on, will be the ones writing code. It's essential that, as soon as they are exposed to the act of creating software, they also are explained that software can be free (and, in fact, it can be argued that it should be free) and that they, themselves, can make it free. Not only that: university staff and professors and researchers have to be given the opportunity to adopt the libre software philosophy in their use, acquisition and development of software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A short talk about my experience becoming involved in GNOME over the last year, including how and why I became involved. I'd also like to talk about my attempts to help the community expand both in terms of developers/contributors as well as 'active' users. Users who like GNOME, and, though they may not have the time and/or ability to contribute, do submit bug reports and try to help others in their use of GNOME technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The strength of your community is the best predictor of your project’s long-term viability, but you can't improve what you can't measure. It's particularly hard to convince developers that focusing on community health even matters without quantitative evidence proving its importance. The huge problems that occur if you fail to deal with issues quickly are nearly unbelievable, but over the past 10 years we've gradually begun to realize the need to think about the people involved in FLOSS projects and not just their output, whether its code, docs, or something else. The most important part of metrics is context -- you need to compare them to something, whether it's historical trends or other open-source projects. Furthermore, by understanding the qualities of data, including statistically expected variation versus unusual outliers, you can gain a true understanding of, and even predict, community health and growth.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When developers talk about scale, they’re thinking numbers of servers, nodes or queries per second. When community minded folk talk about scale, they’re focused on the human and legal infrastructure required to take a project from a small team of 3-4 people to a project serving the needs of tens of developers and hundreds of users. While our toolchains scale well in terms of development, an entirely different infrastructure is required for care and feeding additional participants in your project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to share the benefits and challenges of running an Open Source Community and at the same time having companies selling services around the software. It will cover how the XWiki Open Source Community is managed in a full Open Source way, open to any participants regardless of their interests, and how the employees of private companies including XWiki SAS manage their roles as members of the community. We will also touch on XWiki SAS' approach to support the Open Source project. Finally, we will discuss how the company, as well as developers and users, benefit from a fully Open Source approach.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The strength of your community is the best predictor of your project’s long-term viability. What happens when that community is gradually infiltrated by assholes, who infect everyone else with their constant negativity and personal attacks? Although someone may be a valuable technical contributor, that person will never contribute as much to the project as the many others who are scared away and demotivated. This talk will teach you, using quantified data and academic research from the social sciences, about the dramatic impact assholes are having on your organization today and how you can begin to repair it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what people are really doing in your open source project? Having good community data and metrics for your open source project is a great way to understand what works and what needs improvement over time, and metrics can also be a nice way to highlight contributions from key project members. This session will focus on tips and techniques for collecting and analyzing metrics from tools commonly used by open source projects. It's like people watching, but with data. The best thing about open source projects is that you have all of your community data in the public at your fingertips. You just need to know how to gather the data about your open source community so that you can hack it all together to get something interesting that you can really use.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU/Hurd aims at being a general-purpose Operating System with a strong emphasis on flexibility and freedom for the user, and thus based on a design made of a micro-kernel surrounded by a hurd of userland servers. It has however a long-term vaporware reputation. Development has indeed been relatively dormant for some time, but recent regain of interest has brought interesting improvements and stabilization, to the point that there will be a non-official release of the GNU/Hurd variant of Debian Wheezy, with about 75% of the Debian packages, including classical graphical desktop application (gnome, gnumeric, firefox, ...)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present to GNU/Hurd in general and its "translator" mechanism which replaces the traditional notion of filesystem by userland processes, so as to provide strong flexibility to users and administrators, and we will demo it live. The subhurd/neighborhurd mechanism, a very natural way to provide virtualization container support on GNU/Hurd, will also be presented. We will also present recent developments, notably in terms of DDE device drivers run as userland processes, and discuss about maintenance of DDE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During the development of HelenOS, we have made a couple of wrong technical decisions that required a major fix later on. In this talk, I will mention several instances of these mistakes and describe how we fixed them. I will also attempt to generalize the cause of each problem and give some bold recommendations for avoiding it. The idea is to share this part of our experience with the other projects so that we can learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Device drivers are notoriously known to be a critical and prominent part of modern operating systems. We will draw up a summary of the current state of the art in device driver development: tools, methodologies and approaches which try to mitigate the problem. Then, we will present our take on it: a domain specific language with its own aspect-oriented programming paradigm, and its compiler, Rathaxes. We will show you interesting details of an implementation, in the Rathaxes DSL, of the e1000 ethernet driver for Linux. We will conclude with how Rathaxes fits into the current state of the art, our vision, and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Genode OS Framework is a tool kit for composing special-purpose OSes out of a growing number of ready-to-use components such as device drivers, protocol stacks, runtimes, and in particular microkernels. One year ago, we declared our goal to bring the framework to a level where its developers can use it as day-to-day OS. The talk will briefly introduce the fundamental ideas behind Genode's architecture followed by the presentation of the corner-stone for pursuing our goal to run GNU on Genode, namely the Noux runtime environment. Growing up is not easy. Hence, the second part of the presentation will be an experience report on the challenges we encountered at various levels of the software stack and the ways of how we overcame them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;HelenOS is a microkernel OS running on several architectures where its vital parts (kernel, system services, drivers) are written from
scratch. In the year 2012, a lot of events and changes happened around HelenOS, new major release being the highlight of them. The talk will briefly introduce HelenOS but the focus will be on presenting the achievements of the last 12 months. Among them are new graphical user interface or support for new architectures and devices. But the talk will also touch topics that are not strictly "technical" - our experience with attracting new developers or cooperation with other projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The NOVA microhypervisor combines microkernel and hypervisor functionality and provides an extremely small trusted computing base for user applications
and virtual machines running on top of it. The microhypervisor implements a capability-based authorization model and provides basic mechanisms for virtualization, spatial and temporal separation, scheduling, communication, and management of platform resources. The talk will focus on the hypervisor interface and how it can be used by a multi-server environment to manage platform resources, virtual machines, and user applications. After introducing the capability concept and the basic communication mechanisms,
more advanced topics such as IOMMU support and real-time scheduling will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Operating systems research in fault tolerance has mainly focussed on dealing with faulty software, while resilience against transient hardware errors has been dealt with mostly by applying compiler techniques or using RAD-hardened hardware components.
L4Re's Romain replication framework allows to replicate binary user applications on top of the Fiasco.OC microkernel. Replicas are run independently without modifications and are validated whenever they perform externalization events, such as system calls.
In the talk I'm going to introduce Romain's architecture and discuss issues we had to deal with regarding replication of multithreaded applications in a capability-based system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You should attend this session if you are interested in running complex algorithms on graphs with billions of vertices and edges quickly. You will learn about the ideas behind the Signal/Collect programming model, some benchmarks of our distributed system and how to implement your own algorithms. During the live demo at the end I implement and run an example algorithm using our open source system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some pretty impressive new results (PageRank on Yahoo Webgraph with 1.4 billion vertices and 6.6 billion edges in a bit more than 2 minutes). I have been working on Signal/Collect as part of my PhD for the past 2.5 years and am its main contributor. I presented the parallel version of the model/system at the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) 2010 in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The massive size of the data in large graph processing requires distributed processing. However, conventional frameworks for distributed graph processing, such as Pregel, use programming models that are well-suited for scalability but inconvenient for programming graph algorithms. In this talk, we demonstrate how to use Green-Marl, a Domain-Speciﬁc Language for graph analysis, to describe graph algorithms intuitively and extend its compiler to generate equivalent Pregel programs. Using the semantic information exposed by Green-Marl, the compiler applies the same kinds of transformation rules that programmers apply when manually implementing graph algorithms with Pregel. Our experiments show that the Pregel programs generated by Green-Marl compiler perform similarly to native Pregel implementations of the same algorithms. The compiler is even able to generate a Pregel implementation of a complicated graph algorithm whose native Pregel implementation is very challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;The first paper describing Green-Marl was published at ASPLOS 2012. http://arsenalfc.stanford.edu/kogroup/papers/asplos2012.pdf We have extended our compiler to now generate Giraph code in addition to our c++ backend.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Michael Hunger is going to shed some light over the new High Availability architecture for the popular Neo4j Graph Database. We are going to look at the different variants of the Paxos protocol, master failover strategies and cluster management state handling. This piece of infrastructure poses non-trivial challenges to distributed consensus-finding, an interesting session for anyone into scalable systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session we will use bibliographic data as an example of a large data-set with graph structure. In order to investigate this structure the data is imported into the multi-model database ArangoDB. This database allows to investigate and access the underlying graph: A query language gives you access to basic path structure. Graph traversals written in JavaScript allow you to explore that graph in-depth. Finally, a library of graph algorithms is available to look for hot-spots and the like.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A retrospective cohort study is a medical research study in which the patient records of a group of similar individuals are compared for a particular outcome. For instance, a study can try to assess the impact of smoking behavior with respect to getting lung cancer in a group of 40-year old construction workers who also have been exposed to asbestos. As retrospective case studies are historical in nature, researchers require accurate representations of patient records over time in order to correctly assess the importance of particular time-dependent patient characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this presentation, we will show how state-of-the-art Graph Databases can be extended with a set of temporal primitives that effectively aid researchers at gathering the required insights from a set of longitudinal medical records. Graph Databases are the ideal platform to model and store the multi-dimensional data points of the individual patient records and the cohorts to which they are belonging. By introducing a temporal notion within Graph Databases, physicians are given the power to query beyond time boundaries and get historical access to individual patient characteristics or combinations thereof. Patterns for individual patients can be compared and evaluated against the patterns for the cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to validate our proposed approach, we have implemented FluxGraph, a proof-of-concept Temporal Graph Database. Being Blueprints-compatible, it should be straightforward to integrate the proposed API changes within mature Graph Database products. The explicit notion of time, combined with the flexible modelling offered by Graph Databases, provides users with an expressive and powerful data store and analysis platform which is difficult or even impossible to implement with traditional relational database technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Peter Neubauer presents the LDBC EU-project which is setting out to provide comparative graph-database performance tests for both property-graph and RDF databases/triple-stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LDBC benchmarks will span four main areas of Linked Open Data management: complex query execution, transactionality in graphs, RDF inference and RDF support for ETL/data integration. They will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;target hard problems and choke-points that mostly affect users and hence slow down the uptake of RDF and graph database technology,
encourage innovative performance and scalability improvements that directly benefit users,
be open, community generated, liberally licensed (open-source/creative commons) and target real-world usage scenario,
become the de facto standard for publishing performance results and enable objective judgements about the performance and functionality of competing vendor offerings.
points that mostly affect users
The LDBC Foundation will work in the same spirit as the Transaction Processing Council (TPC) that has established a widely accepted by the industry, set of benchmarks for relational database management systems.It will be responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifying benchmarks, benchmarking procedures and verifying/publishing results,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing a TPC-style auditing service for certifying results published by vendors for benchmarks endorsed by LDBC,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;training auditors for its benchmarking, creating a long lasting business model for auditing benchmark results.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With related-work.net we introduce a scientific platform that is using neo4j to store an open citation graph of research articles and build a social networking application on top of it. We use Google Web Toolkit enhanced by the Model View Presenter framework GWTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related-Work offers the following core functionality (http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/related-work-net-product-requirement-document-released/):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convenient browsing of scientific literature using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhance scientific communication with Q&amp;amp;A features inspired by StackOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we show that graph databases are the natural technology to power not only a social networking application but are the best choice for a question and answer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics of the talk include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design and implementation of a discussion system on top of a social network application using a graph database.
Why does it scale better than relational approaches?
Why is it more flexible than a document store?
Techniques for storing big graphs in neo4j and performing data mining tasks
Benchmarks comparing neo4j’s core API to Cypher Query language.
How to build personalized graph based search indices
Performance boosts by smart client side caching for local graph queries.
Currently only a preliminary python based demo is online at dev.related-work.net but we are working hard to get our +10’000 lines of code deployed in the beginning of 2013. That will already include a basic Q &amp;amp; A System as well as various data mining techniques on graphs, recommendation engines and personalized search and auto completion. The source code can be found at: https://github.com/renepickhardt/related-work.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with Heinrich Hartmann (Koblenz), David Shotton (Oxford) and Sun Xinruo (Shanghai Jiao Tong University).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Flex-It is a declarative query language allowing users to query graph data whose structure is complex, not fully-known or ever-changing, or where there is a requirement for the intelligent exploration of a graph. Flex-It performs both approximate matching and relaxation of the user’s query, and ranks the answers according to how closely they match the original query. This is of especial relevance in areas where there are large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data with ever-evolving schemas; these include bioinformatics (and other scientific disciplines), financial information and social networks, among others.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Squire is an app for iPad that provides suggestions of movies and TV shows, based on the user’s preferences. There are also some social features, for instance a user can suggest a movie or TV show to one of his/her contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed the backend and web services that support the Squire iPad app. The recommendations system was written in Scala and everything else was developed in Ruby. This architecture tries to combine the best features of the different languages. The Ruby API is easy to maintain, while the recommendations engine written in Scala and Neo4j is powerful, fast and able to handle heavy computations in a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

I'll speak about the early days, present material from the first prototypes, how the project evolved from a naïve CMS approach to a sophisticated REST backend framework driven by a customer project, and how we're now building CMS components and more projects on that basis. I'll end up with some conclusions and a short demo of structr. In an extensive Q&amp;amp;A session, I'd like to answer questions, discuss different approaches and lessons learned, and maybe give some hints to help and encourage people to get started with Neo4j or graph databases in general.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will go through the steps needed to create and maintain a dictionary for Apache OpenOffice, including how to package it for the Extensions web site and how to include it in the builds available for download from the official site. Then we will have a look at how to improve the maintenance of Apache OpenOffice dictionaries through web services, revisiting a proposal I originally made at OOoCon 2010 in Budapest.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Custom shapes were introduced in OOo2.0 to get better import and export filters to MS Office. There is currently no UI to generate your own custom shapes and therefore their usefulness in other contexts are widely unknown. This talk shows how to make your own custom shape by using the definitions in the ODF specification.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

It should help interested developers to get conceptually jump-started with developing AOO/LO applications. It also introduces and demonstrates a free and opensource tool of a student from WU that allows creating hyperlinked documentation for UNO objects a programmer has in hands, but also for UNO types supplying the fully qualified name. Using the dispatch interface any AOO/LO language can take advantage of this great and helpful functionality aimed at developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Today many software systems are built with a steaming pile of "object-oriented" (deliberate scare quotes) code that is, to put it politely, hard to follow. This talk focuses on using "roles" to create a simpler, safer system that is easy to understand and extend. Example code is Perl and Ruby, but it applies to any language that can implement roles.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms are optimization methods used throughout a wide array of problems, from industrial operations through games to bioinformatics. Its key operations are done on strings and arrays, and given the nature of scientific work, it pays to be code-productive more than high performance. However, high performance pays too, so in this talk we will introduce several Perl evolutionary algorithm modules and how they have been applied to several problems and improved using profiling.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Tevreden.nl is a leading agency in customer and employee satisfaction research in the Netherlands. We enable our customers to conduct fourth generation satisfaction research and continually analyze and publish the results. To do so we use a system that has been fully developed in house; it is tailor made to fit our customer’s and our needs.
The system consists approx. 50 different databases spread out over multiple MySQL servers all tied together by one Perl application. The application is a web application. It and its connected websites and processes run on a classical LAMP stack of which the ""P"" is exclusively Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will focus on some Perl features that save us a lot of time and some of it idiosyncrasies that we have learned to deal with. Our main challenges in development and operations lie in the collection of questionnaire data from several sources, safeguarding the integrity of the collected data and the results and of course providing an adequate user experience through all this. The talk will focus on these aspects."&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

It will mainly focus on the Perl module DBIx::Class, but this isn't really an introductory talk. What we are going to try to do is to push the boundaries of what people normally try to do with a RDBMS. Even if you are proficient with SQL and/or the abstraction framework that comes with your language of choice, you may be pleasantly surprised and maybe even inspired by some of the possibilities that will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NoSQL is neither a technology nor a consistent product category. However, behind this marketing buzzword lie some really exciting projects that should deeply transform the data management area. Beware: this talk is definitely not intended to introduce yet another noSQL taxonomy. It's essentially focused on the so-called "document store" paradigm and its use through perl applications, with a practical illustration against MongoDB, that is probably the most easy to use product in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Perl has always been improving itself, mostly by evolution, sometimes by revolution. One such revolution, was the start of the Perl 6 development effort in 2000. In the meantime, after a period of impasse, Perl (5) continued evolving gradually. However, it now (2013) seems that the original Perl 1/2/3/4/5 code base has reached a level of jenga that makes it virtually impossible for anybody to make very much needed structural changes.This presentation will give an overview of how different projects are now attacking this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The BSDA certification is designed to be an entry-level certification on BSD Unix systems administration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing candidates with a general Unix background and at least six months of work experience as a BSD systems administrator, or who wish to obtain employment as a BSD systems administrator, will benefit most from this certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful BSDA candidate is able to complete common administrative and troubleshooting tasks and has a good understanding of general BSD Unix and networking principles. In addition, the successful candidate demonstrates basic skills with these BSD operating systems: Dragonfly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. This does not mean that the candidate needs to learn the complete details of four operating systems. It does mean that the candidate is aware of the basic utilities common to these operating systems, and where specified in the exam objectives, of features unique to some of the BSD operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Walking into a project made of  millions of lines of code can be daunting - we'll discuss strategies for getting involved, how to learn without getting lost, where to ask for help, and you'll get a high-level overview of the parts that make up  Firefox. By the time you leave, you'll know how to obtain the source, read it, learn it, write it, and finally ship it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;MDN is a web development resource for and by developers. The MDN community documents web standards on an HTML-based wiki platform – the code of which is also open source. Web Platforms.org is an effort between all the major browser vendors and WC3 to provide community-written documentation across products, platforms, and technologies. Find out how these efforts compliment each other and validate the open source and  community-driven model for documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

I want to convince "geeks" that they should make some efforts to welcome "normal people", because geeks need Average Jane or Joe to understand what the public really wants or needs. It's the only way to really open the Web!
So, of course, I will explain what geeks can do to attract "normal people", in order to attract more into FLOSS community.
To attend to this talk you only need your sense of humor :-)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

In short, an ILE uses UX paradigms like   code completion to implement translation suggestions and the like. As   Axel can't spell, the pathway to being a lucky localizer is dubbed   "aisle", a web based ILE with both server- and client-side tools. He's   going to show a demo of how that will look.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Firefox certainly isn't as smooth as you would like it to be, at least in some situations. But sometimes, these problems are hard to reproduce for developers because they only appear under some circumstances. The  Gecko profiler empowers users and allows them to  either give important profiling data to developers, or track the root cause of their performance problems themselves.
Other times, Firefox is not entirely to blame, and scripts on some web sites are just too slow. The Gecko profiler also allows to profile content performance.
This session will introduce the Gecko profiler, how to use it in different scenarios, and how to use it to get useful data from your desktop browser or even Firefox for Android.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We care passionately about quality, and one of the ways we
can improve quality is by writing automated tests. These run much faster
and more frequently than we could possibly do so manually, and help us
to catch regressions as soon as possible. Find out how we're writing
automated tests for Firefox OS using tools built right into the browser,
and how this is ultimately going to align with the new WebDriver
specification. We'll demonstrate tests running against devices, and show
you how easy it can be to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

However, with the   advent  of many new HTML5 APIs and blazing fast JavaScript engines it  is  now possible to create native like applications within the browser.   In  this  talk I’ll cover Mozilla’s reasons for creating PDF.js, a  brief  overview  of the PDF format, how we render PDF’s using HTML5, and  some  of the  lessons we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Mercurial (hg) DVCS holds a major role in the Mozilla infrastructure. For more
than a year, a lot of work have been done on innocent history rewriting
features. Rewriting history have always been a powerful but dangerous feature of
DVCS. Recent changes in mercurial bring new innovations solving all intrinsic
troubles of the concept. This both eases the learning curve of new contributors
and boosts the efficiency of power users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The new feature (= changeset evolution) follows the Mercurial philosophy: easy,
safe and powerful. Mercurial now tracks changes at a very fine level improving
possibility for your changeset to be reviewed, tested, restored to previous
version and allows people to collaboratively edit the same branch of the history
in a distributed way. Users of the MQ extension in particular will be given new
tools that allow the similar workflow without the current MQ
drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>the challenge of sandboxed proprietary cloud services</subtitle>
        <track>Legal issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a number of cloud-based
Infrastructure-as-a-Service ("IaaS") offerings have emerged that
provide officially supported free (as in beer) Linux, MySQL and other
server images for use in the cloud. The majority of the components
that make up these images are licensed under copyleft terms. However,
the default approach of many cloud service providers is to
contractually limit the use of these official Linux images to
execution within their propriety cloud service. To the extent they
make available complete and corresponding source code for the purposes
of examination or modification, the cloud service providers also
restrict access and viewing of that source code to within the
sandboxed cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will examine the legal and business justifications for
such practices. What good is complete and corresponding source
(freedom 1) in a sandboxed environment if you are essentially denied
use of it outside of a proprietary cloud service (freedoms 0, 2 and
3)? Are these restrictions enforceable? What steps can FOSS developers
take to prevent their projects from being subverted by cloud
providers?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most open source projects have chosen to build versions of their code
for a variety of platforms. This helps the advance of software
freedom, since people are frequently exposed to the reality for the
first time when they try open source software on a platform where it's
otherwise absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the case of platforms gated by app stores, the common wisdom
appears to be to disrupt access to open source software by exercising
the copyright holders' right to object to conflicts with the license
they have used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this the right approach? Should we be waiving our objections to app
store terms so that software freedom is promoted on them? Or is it
vital to object on principle in every case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This "talk" will be introductory comments from Simon Phipps and Amanda
Brock followed by an open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How to Share a Trademark</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Every project has a trademark, its name. Some believe that trademarks
and the enforcement of trademark rights are inconsistent with FLOSS
principles. But some amount of control over when and how a project
name can be used is necessary for the name to remain meaningful as a
an identifier of a specific software program with known attributes and
qualities. That's the role of trademark law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing how we would like to be able to use FLOSS trademarks with
currently existing trademark law is challenging. Trademarks are
fundamentally different from copyrights, so the licensing concepts
that work for copyright don't work for the name. Complicating matters
further, current trademark jurisprudence generally contemplates that
trademark owners are formalized legal entities in hierarchical
structure, so the law is ill-suited for a world of collective
decisionmaking by non-employees in a dynamic organizational structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it still can come together in a way that serves the goals of free
software and meets the requirements of trademark law. I will explore
with the participants what the appropriate role of trademarks in FLOSS
is and talk about ways that software projects can manage the use of
their trademarks with some degree of freedom while still maintaining
the validity of the trademark, with a view towards shaping the law so
that it is better-suited for handling FLOSS concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla project was one of the first "take a company's code and
open it" projects, has always been one of the biggest open source
projects, and likes to leverage the work of others. We also own an
extremely valuable trademark. This means that if you can think of a
licensing or trademark issue, Mozilla has probably had to deal with
it. And despite the head of the project being a lawyer, most of the
issues have been handled by non-lawyers. This talk will be a brief
journey through some of the more interesting (to those on this track,
at any rate) things we've faced, with plenty of time for questions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Panel Discussion: GNU Affero General Public License, version 3</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This panel will discuss the GNU Affero General Public License, version
3 (AGPLv3), a copyleft license which includes a clause designed to
ensure that users of network-deployed applications receive complete
corresponding source code for the deployed application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AGPLv3 has roots in the early 2000s, when some free software advocates
called attention to what some described as an “Application Service
Provider loophole” in GPLv2. One response was AGPLv1, a modification
of GPLv2 published by Affero, Inc. and drafted with Free Software
Foundation (FSF)'s help. AGPLv1 and contemporary licenses addressing
this policy issue saw limited adoption..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many expected, and some strongly advocated for, FSF to incorporate the
Affero clause into GPLv3. Instead, in 2007 the FSF drafted a separate
license, AGPLv3, containing an additional requirement that modified
versions of a program offer access to corresponding source to all
users interacting with AGPLv3'd programs through a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AGPLv3 has seen little adoption by individual free software developers
and community projects for various reasons. Yet notable exceptions
exist, such as GNU MediaGoblin. Currently, AGPLv3's most common use is
by businesses as a means of promoting purchases of proprietary
software licenses, a practice often criticized by some framers of
AGPLv3. Meanwhile, some corporate open source users have investigated
the issue of AGPLv3 compliance. Awareness of AGPLv3 has steadily
increased with the growing focus on “Cloud Computing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel, comprised of a few of the world's foremost experts on
AGPLv3, seeks to discuss and explain all issues surrounding AGPLv3 and
contemplate the future of AGPLv3 as a viable copyleft license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderator: &lt;strong&gt;Richard Fontana&lt;/strong&gt;, IP Counsel at Red Hat. Richard is responsible for open source legal matters at Red Hat, and in his prior role at the Software Freedom Law Center he was co-drafter of GPLv3 and AGPLv3. He is an active public speaker on FLOSS legal and policy issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eileen Evans&lt;/strong&gt;, Vice President &amp;amp; Associate General Counsel, Cloud &amp;amp; Open Source, Hewlett-Packard Company. Eileen has spoken on complex open source issues at many open source conferences in the U.S. and in Europe and with governmental bodies, such as the European Commission and Members of the European Parliament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bradley M. Kuhn&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director, Software Freedom Conservancy and Member of FSF's Board of Directors. Kuhn invented the original Affero clause, and helped draft AGPLv1 and AGPLv3. Kuhn is also widely known for his work in Free Software licensing compliance and Free Software non-profit management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher Allan Webber&lt;/strong&gt;, Lead Developer, GNU MediaGoblin (free software image, audio, video publishing platform). Activist and developer for free software and network services freedom. Previously worked at Creative Commons as software engineer (and occasionally involved in licensing as well). Presently works fulltime on GNU MediaGoblin via money raised in a crowdfunding campaign in conjunction with the Free Software Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The addition of atomic page flip to the kernel should allow the configuration of overlays within a frame boundary. This allows KMS Wayland compositors, such as Weston, to use overlays seamlessly. In this talk we'll cover how Weston assigns different surfaces to overlays and other planes, to reduce the portion of the screen that is composited using GL. There will also be a short demo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using hardware overlays for composing the display contents can provide significant power savings. However today's users are a demanding bunch, so the system must guarantee that display contents composed from multiple hardware overlays update in an atomic fashion. What challenges does that pose for the display driver, and what kind of changes are required for the DRM modesetting API?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ville will start with trying to untangle the maze of terms like "atomic page flip" and "atomic mode setting".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going on, the talk will includea short introduction to typical display controller hardware. Listing the relevant hardware components and the software abstractions we use to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will a be short section on mode setting, and more specifically why both mode setting and atomic updates play a role in the current design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we go through the atomic display updates, what is that we want to achieve, and what make is so difficult with current hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally Ville will describe the new kernel APIs, and go through some of the design decisions leading to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will walk the audience through the graphics stack and then concentrate on scenarios where the Graphics Stack is not secure.
Lastly, we will talk about the upgrades to DRM and the DRI2 protocols that are currently being done&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During this talk we will survey the current state of security in the Linux Graphics Stack and illustrate the problem with real-life scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will then explain the source of these problems, describe how they interact with the X and Wayland infrastructures and discuss the solutions currently deployed to mitigate those issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will lead us to the current work on DRI and DRM, known under the names DRI-next and drm2/render nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How software projects around kmscon try to provide multi-seat support, hardware-accelerated rendering, full internationalization support and more to the linux-console by moving CONFIG_VT into user-space.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;CONFIG_VT is the kernel configuration option that enables virtual terminals in the kernel. Initially written by Linus himself, it has been around since 1991. However, it hasn't been updated much recently and thus lacks a big amount of functionality, namely multi-seat support, full Unicode font rendering, XKB-like keyboard handling, hardware-accelerated rendering, vt220-vt510 compatibility and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be split into two parts. In the first half I will be talking about the terminal emulator in the kernel, its limitations and how kmscon provides a modern replacement that moves terminal-emulation out of the kernel into user-space where it belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half will be about the ancient POSIX VT API. I will explain why it was needed in the first place and discuss why current linux system still depend on it. We tried several replacements, including system-compositors, dbus-VTs and CUSE-based VTs and I will compare them to the classic POSIX VT API to show how the issues of VTs can actually be solved by dropping CONFIG_VT entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Every game for desktop PCs has the ability for the user to tune quality and performance settings.  However, for the out-of-the-box experience, these games also need to detect the hardware installed in the user's system to select the initial settings.  On Windows and Mac, there are a number of system interfaces provided for this purpose, but on Linux it is surprisingly difficult.  This talk will cover some current best practices used by shipping Linux games.  It will also introduce some interfaces under development to improve the current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will start by covering X.Org's community health and metrics. X.Org didn’t get into GSoC (Google Summer of Code) last year so it’s also going to be a discussion of issues and potential solutions to change that for this summer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will illustrate community health and show quantitative metrics on the X.Org community, using many of the techniques described by this talk on context from the community devroom. X.Org didn’t get into GSoC last year so it’s also going to be a discussion of problems and potential solutions there, based on Donnie's experience in helping administer GSoC for Gentoo Linux as well as X.Org.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A summary of the situation of X.Org on non-Linux systems (BSD, Solaris,...) and what progress is being made (or not) on those systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;X has been multi-platform from the start. In the last 10 years, Linux has become the main, and often the only system used by X developpers. This has had consequences on the support of new features on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will look at the various os dependant parts of the X window system, and how they are handled on non Linux platforms. In particular, kernel support (KMS and TTM) are developed on Linux, and require large porting efforts for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will summarize the status on various platforms and the work in progress to keep up with mainstream X (and Wayland ?) development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on using the Lua Programming Language to Create a Graphical User Interface&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most toolkits for graphical user interfaces organize the elements of the user interface, typically called "widgets", in a hierarchy: Starting with some container like a dialog or window at the top, the elements like push buttons, labels, or layout managers are added. To add new elements a set of C functions is provided which are called with a handle to the parent widget, the class (or type) of widget that is to be added plus any further arguments like e.g. a label string in the case of a push button. While it is relatively easy to expose the widget creation and managing functions to Lua, the resulting Lua program will still closely resemble the same functionality coded in C. So the aim is to use Lua's table constructors to define a GUI instead of calling the widget creation routines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the unusual architecture of the Mali-200/400 shaders and the current efforts to write compiler backends for these two processors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, with more and more functionality moving from fixed-function hardware to programmable shaders in graphics processors, the design of the shader Instruction Set Architecture in hardware and the corresponding compiler in the driver is more important than ever. The Mali 200 and 400 GPU's are no exception, and so one of the most important jobs of a reverse-engineered open-source driver like Lima is to understand the ISA of the hardware in question and write a compiler to replace the existing closed-source one. When Luc Verhaegen kicked off the Lima project last year at FOSDEM, this important work had not been started, but since then a few developers, including Connor Abbott and Ben Brewer, reverse-engineered and then started to write tools for the Mali 200/400 Geometry Processor (GP) and Pixel Processor (PP) architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Linux Kernel version 3.8 is the first one to include a KMS driver for the NVIDIA Tegra line of SoCs. Although it's capabilities are still limited right now, it's already able to supersede any downstream framebuffer driver. This talk will give an overview of the current work and what to expect from the OpenTegra project in the next time. Demo of a live system included.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to other open ARM graphics driver projects the Tegra-DRM/OpenTegra projects priority is not to provide a free 3D driver on top of some preexisting infrastructure, but rather to implement a free graphics driver from the ground up. A large leap forward was made with the addition of the Tegra KMS driver to the mainline Linux Kernel. Still a lot of functionality is missing, but there are combined efforts ongoing from both the free software community and NVIDIA to provide a satisfying and maintainable solution to Tegra graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will mostly be about the technical details/hurdles faced by the developers, but will also clean up some myths that have spread around OpenTegra since the rather incomplete presentation at XDC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At last year's FOSDEM, we discussed the feasibility of Wayland input methods. One year later and we have a working solution that will be part of Wayland's next stable release. What better place than FOSDEM (again!) to show the progress and discuss the remaining work?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why XIM -- X11's input method -- is still popular, 18 years after its initial design: A unified API that works across toolkits is highly appealing to developers of CJK input methods. Even today, input method frameworks are expected to have decent XIM support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downsides of XIM and X11 are the complexity and the lack of protocol evolution over the last years. Everyone who tried to integrate input methods with an X11 window manager will know the pain of focus stealing and window stacking issues. Initiatives to improve X11 in that area have stalled for years. In the meantime, toolkits have come up with their own solutions, ignoring the fragmentation caused for input method developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Android's input method framework is a good showcase for modern use-cases (think virtual keyboard) and the tight integration with the system compositor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Wayland, we can achieve the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will be an open invitation to device manufacturers, toolkit providers and input method developers alike to give Wayland and its new input method protocol a try and help us with feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since 10 years the Debian Med project tries to attract developers and users of Free Software in the field of medical care and microbiological research &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the Debian distribution.  The strict approach package everything for official Debian and relay completely on the Debian infrastructure as so called "Debian Pure Blend" has turned out as very successful and enabled a constant growth regarding the number of packages in this field but also in the number of developers and users.
The talk will stress either the consequences to stick into a distribution (there are similar projects in Fedora and SuSE) or to be an example for other sciences how to reasonable attract scientist into your team.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of multiple imaging modalities is central to the radiotherapy routine. As a consequence, the flows of biomedical images inside the RT departments are at the same time numerous and complex. This has motivated the development of the Orthanc open-source software that is designed to improve such workflows. Orthanc is a free, Web-based DICOM store. Orthanc features rich scripting capabilities that makes it scalable and flexible: Thanks to its RESTful API, Orthanc can be driven from any computer language to automate the imaging workflows that are very specific to each hospital. Orthanc is deployed in our Institution to optimize several real-world clinical processes by improving the interconnection between various DICOM modalities and by simplifying the data management of medical images.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>FOSS for Scientists</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge about the biochemical reaction taking place in a living
cell has increased to a point where we are able to map large parts of
their metabolic network. Moreover, advanced simulation techniques
enable us to simulate the growth of a cell on the metabolic level. To
grasp the topology of the metabolic network and to interpret the
fluxes through its reactions a visualization of the simulation results
is indispensable. However, traditional graph visualizations are unable
to cope with the complexity of metabolic networks and often very
cluttered graphs. In contrast, AMEBA reduces the number of nodes
displayed while retaining as much information as possible by
identifying branch points in the metabolic network. Although the
algorithm does not rely on extrinsic information, it can be guided
additionally by expert knowledge to produce camera-ready figures.
Furthermore, the run-time of less than a second -- even for large
metabolic networks -- enables an interactive usage. This way, a
researcher can track the fate of compounds through the whole network
and thus is able to get the big picture. The development of AMEBA was
tremendously facilitated by the availability of FLOSS. In fact, the
first prototype was created within a week and subsequently refined to
a stable analysis tool, which is now available under the terms of the
GPL (http://metano.tu-bs.de/ameba). The talk will cover the details of
the algorithm and will highlight the steps at which FLOSS was crucial
for the success of this piece of scientific software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>FOSS for Scientists</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry is a scientific field that has revolutionized the way we look at biochemical objects, and thus also at cells and organs, leading to enormous advances in biology these last 10-15 years. Mass spectrometry is a rather recent field in biology (converse to other fields, like genetics, genomics). Therefore, awareness about Free Software is very low among mass spectrometrists. Only since the last few years are people starting to develop on Free Software systems (Ubuntu, for example). But the mentality still has to progress a bit, as for the moment people develop software and keeps that soft in their lab without thinking about packaging it for their platform. I want to develop a project similar to NeuroDebian, that would bring to the mass spectrometrists a Debian platform for developing software and building mass data analysis workflows all based on Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other aspect of software in mass spectrometry is related to the fact that mass spec vendors are trying hard the MS strategy to lock-in users in black-box data formats. We need to force them to open the formats or at least to force them to write proper full-featured converters to open standard formats. Free software must be a way to force vendors to behave properly. There are thousands of terabytes of
biological data at stake.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As computational power increases, scientists are able to run larger and more accurate simulations. This is creating significant challenges in scientific research as the amount of data produced increases, previous analysis techniques become less useful. Worse still, if common formats cannot be agreed upon getting the output of one code into a suitable analysis tool can be difficult. This is where open source tools present a strong alternative to traditional software
models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces some of the open source technology developed in the Open Chemistry project at Kitware. Recent advances in open source scientific visualization will be discussed, going from smaller chemical data sets such as those that can be analyzed by Avogadro, through to advanced visualization techniques available in the Visualization Toolkit, ParaView and Avogadro 2. The talk will also discuss MoleQueue, a tool for desktop high-performance computing integration, and MongoChem, a tool for desktop cheminformatics. The Open Chemistry applications integrate with one another using an open JSON-RPC based communication channel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>ZIO: a framework for high capacity I/O</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>FOSS for Scientists</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ZIO is framework for the Linux kernel, meant to support development of drivers for high performance I/O devices; it provides tools for easy and fast driver development. It is hosted on ohwr.org, where it has a public git repository, mailing list and the usual other goodies. ZIO is already in active use in a few big laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is explaining the main features of the framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of a "block" abstraction, which includes data and meta-data. This allows transferring large amounts of I/O samples while  preserving complete description of what the data is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized management and monitoring of data and meta-data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete symmetry between the input and output data flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of the Linux bus abstraction, to support several devices of the same type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centralization of the locking policy within the framework. This relieves the developer from most lock-related headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modular design: buffers, triggers and hardware drivers are all independent one another. Users can choose the buffer and trigger type at run time for each peripheral device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export of device attributes through the sysfs interface (no ioctl);.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scotch (and its parallel offspring PT-Scotch) is a scientific toolbox for graph partitioning, static mapping, clustering and sparse matrix ordering : http://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotch is widely used by many academic and industrial entities, either by itself or through other well-known software packages such as MUMPS, OpenFOAM, etc. It is distributed under the CeCILL-C libre software license. This year 2012 was the 20th anniversary of Scotch. For this occasion, version 6.0 was released, which introduced many new features. It is the occasion to present how the project was started, how it evolved, how it could gain momentum, and discuss licensing and organisational matters.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I will present the G’MIC framework for image processing
and its different interfaces. G’MIC has been already recognized as a
popular plug-in for GIMP, but it is actually much more than that. It
defines a complete script language for image processing and defines several
interfaces to use it, with different complexity levels : low-level uses
(command-line, C++ library) to higher-level GUI (GIMP plug-in, webcam GUI
or as a web-service).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Automated test and measurement is an important area of development across fields from biology to IC manufacturing.  "Big science" has evolved into "big data", which necessarily entails "big measurement". In science the problem is amplified by the experimental nature of measurements; the user often does not know a priori what region of
parameter space is of interest. Instrumentation which offers immediate feedback may be ill-suited to repetitive, automated measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mezurit 2 [2] is cross-platform Free Software (GPL) designed to make the setup and operation of experiments common in nanoscience and low-temperature physics quick and easy, while providing mechanisms for complex automation.  In a typical scenario, the user begins by defining several virtual channels, each corresponding to a physical quantity present in the device under test, as functions of available input and outputs provided by DAQ boards and GPIB-connected external hardware. Then, the user can control several virtual instruments which provide mechanisms to view and record data, sweep outputs, and configure event triggers.  After working out the optimal procedure, the user can then automate everything using the comprehensive Python-based scripting interface.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A brief overview of the history, development, and multi-threaded architecture of Mezurit 2 will be presented, along with a live demonstration using simulated hardware.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve soft real-time operation (in concert with the PREEMPT_RT patch) will be discussed. The talk will conclude with a discussion of a
hypothetical open-source data acquisition platform with the goal of producing similar applications with more flexibility and much less effort, without resorting to proprietary software such as LabVIEW.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Odeint is a modern C++ library for numerically solving Ordinary Differential
Equations which got recently accepted to become part of the boost libraries.
It is developed in a generic way using Template Metaprogramming and Generic
Programming, which leads to extraordinary high flexibility at top performance.
The numerical algorithms are implemented independently of the underlying
arithmetics. This results in an incredible applicability of the library,
especially in non-standard environments. For example, odeint supports matrix
types, arbitrary precision arithmetics and can even be easily run on GPUs. In
this talk, I will give a short introduction to the library including a number
of examples.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give a short introduction how systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be solved on modern GPU devices. The talk is based on odeint [1] a C++ library devoted to solve ODEs and which is accepted as a Boost library. I will mainly show how different CUDA and OpenCL libraries can be used in odeint and compare these libraries by usability and performance. In more detail I will consider the frameworks VeXCL[2], ViennaCL[3], Thrust[4] and MTL[5] which are all OSS libraries for GPU technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

The focus is on numerical processing in double-precision, covering a wide range of topics (ordinary differential equations, statistics, linear algebra, random number generation, optimization, and others). Contributions are mainly driven by use-cases arising from real-world applications.
Development is based on clean, maintainable, object-oriented design and extensive documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, radio astronomy has undergone a revolution: complex analogue machinery such as dishes is increasingly being replaced by arrays
of simple antennae combined with fast networking and high-performance computing.
The AARTFAAC project is taking advantage of this to build a round-the-clock monitor of the visible sky, providing a groundbreaking capability to detect to some of the most exciting and energetic astronomical events as they happen. However, turning the signals recorded by the telescope's antennae into astronomically relevant images is highly computationally intensive, and requires the development of a fast, flexible, scalable streaming data processing pipeline. I will describe the design of this pipeline, explaining how we use open source software to address some of the challenges we face and push forward our understanding of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LOFAR, the Low Frequency Array, is a new radio telescope constructed across Northern Europe which has recently started science operations. One of its key science goals is to detect and, where appropriate, respond to transient astronomical phenomena – such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts – as they happen. However, identifying these transients
in the multi-terabyte LOFAR data stream is complex, and making the results easily accessible to astronomers is hard. I will describe the automatic transient identification systems we have put in place, and particularly emphasize how we use the high-performance, open-source MonetDB database system to make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework written in Python that allows you to install software in a structured, repeatable and robust way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Easybuild is motivated by the need for a tool that allows to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; independently install multiple versions of software side-by-side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; support multiple compilers and libraries for building software and its
dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; keep the software build configuration simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; divert from the standard configure / make / make install with custom
procedures (which is often necessary for scientific software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; use environment modules [7] for dependency resolution and making the
software available to users in a transparent way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; keep record of the installation logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; keep track of installation configuration in version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some key properties of EasyBuild:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; installation configuration is done using a (very concise) .eb
specification file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; custom behaviour is described in easyblocks; these are Python classes
that can be plugged into the EasyBuild framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the generation of the module files to easily make the software
available to users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the dependencies for installation are resolved using environment
modules and can be automatically installed using the robot feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; after the installation, the specification files can be sent to a
repository for archiving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this venue I don't think it is necessary to talk about the advantages of
open source in science. So let me add another one: it is incredibly easy to
set up an almost free volunteer computing infrastructure which you can then
use for crowdsourced experiments. In fact, SETI@home, the quintessentially
crowdsourcing environment, has been released as the libre BOINC platform;
but nowadays, with just a few lines of code and a plain vanilla server, you
can create your own volunteer (or not-so) computing environment. In this
talk we will explain how to set up a browser-based volunteer computing
platform using NoSQL servers and what are the advantages of doing so
(including a boost to your H number).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>FOSS for Scientists</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Complex-system models describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. Since such models are usually non-linear and impossible to solve analytically, their analysis is often carried out by simulation on high performance computing environments. Cluster, grid and cloud computing are nowadays adopted, but their use still requires specific technical and methodological skills. That is why high performance computing is not yet part of the daily practices in numerous communities where it would be needed.
OpenMOLE (Open MOdeL Experiment: www.openmole.org) is a FOSS framework that implements a solution to this problem. It emphasizes on the easy integration of home-brewed models and on transparent scaling from a single computer up to a grid execution. It makes it possible for the modellers to build workflows for experimenting on their simulation model.
OpenMOLE is based on a blackbox approach to embbed models based on very different technologies: java / scala / C / C++ / fortran / scilab / octave / netlogo... Once the user model is embedded in the platform, it can be executed according to various design of experiments, sensitivity analysis, calibration processes... OpenMOLE automatically distributes the numerous executions of the model on a distributed environment specified by the user, such as a cluster or even on the 100,000+ cores available on the European computing grid. The platform takes care of software installation, files transfert, job failures, rendering the distributed execution entierly transparent.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; science, in the sense that when developed in the course
of computational science research, it can't be classified as
"infrastructure" or "support". If a telescope is infrastructure for
astronomy, then its equivalent or computational mathematics is a
supercomputer. On the other hand, code produced to prove a theorem,
simulate an explosion or study an image denoising algorithm &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the
subject-matter of the science being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need this work to be recognized and time and effort invested in it
must be rewarded by scholarship standards. On the other hand,
when science is based on software foundations, the computational part
of the research should be subject to validation by the scientific
method. This implies that every program used in the elaboration of a
research paper should, at least, be usable by referees, and if
possible be publicly available is source form. Open Source software is
part of the equation, but it is not sufficient to answer the questions
raised here.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During this talk, we will present the rationale for the "Software as
Science" approach, in relation with other ideas, chiefly Reproducible
Research and Open Science, and we will mention recent workshops and
conferences, as well as groups, projects and institutions involved in
these dynamics. We will list and detail numerous obstacles to the
recognition of software in the scientific method and open questions on
that matter: identification and citation, standard APIs and languages,
verification and validation, copyright and patents, limits to
reproducibility, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will present our own project, IPOL, a research journal
on image processing, in which every algorithm is published (Open
Access license) and reviewed with the source code of its
implementation (Open Source license) and a web interface to test it
and browse archived experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"These days, it often feels like php is an old, creepy piece of code - it seems that all the cool code kids are using ruby, node or java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this actually the truth? Maybe php is just different. I believe we as a community are on the right way to take our tools, frameworks, and the community itself to a new level. Composer, Packagist, PHPspec, and PSR are just a first step in the right direction. Each of us can do their part - you could, and you should also be a part of it. So lets unite into an awesome, open-minded community, leaving the php 3 times behind us!"&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, the TYPO3 community was seeking for a framework as a foundation for their new CMS. There was none satisfying their wishlist of features and architecture and thus a new one was made - top notch, built without the pressure of day to day work. In the meantime TYPO3 Flow has become one of the “serious” PHP frameworks which is built on two paradigms: harness the complexity of enterprise applications but at the same time be concise and developer friendly. Or in short: Flow brings back the joy of development in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session introduces some of the main features of TYPO3 Flow 2.0 and gives you an idea about how it relates to the well established frameworks on the market.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

This talk proposes to walk through the progress made and challenges met over the last year in providing 7u releases. Highlights of new features, new platforms and significant bug fixes will be included. The talk will also give a summary of how developers can help contribute code fixes to 7u. Feedback will be welcome from the audience on what's good and not so good about working with OpenJDK7u.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Java packaging in Linux has never been trivial. Partially due to strict
principles that most Linux distributions adhere to, partially due to Java
ecosystem encouraging behavior which goes against these principles, but mostly
due to ineffective tooling on both sides of the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over past 2 years, tooling and guidelines for packaging Java have changed in
Fedora Linux considerably. What used to be a 1000 line build script can soon
become 100 lines of mostly metadata. But all of that relies on sane build system
with predictable behavior on Java side: Maven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course of the talk we will clean up one such build script and
describe how each change was made possible. Most importantly we hope to convince
the audience that for common good, using Maven for Java development even with
all its quirks is better than the alternatives. A wider discussion on other Java
build systems would also be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>Free Java</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ARM's new, 64 bit ARMv8 architecture, is a break from the past in two
regards. The change of scale from 32 to 64 bit implies a broadening of
ARM's target market from (mostly) embedded devices to address the
requirements of high end consumer devices and servers. The 64 bit mode
(AArch64) programming model is significantly different from the existing
32 bit model. If ARM's change of direction does indeed grab a
significant share of this market then there are two corresponding
implications for the Free Java community. We need a high quality free
Java implementation to ensure that the market is not colonised solely by
commercial Java vendors. We need to provide this implementation from
scratch rather than try to modify existing 32 bit Java implementations.
Red Hat has decided to port OpenJDK to AArch64 precisely to meet these
implications head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe the significant progress we have made in porting
OpenJDK to AArch64 since the project began in earnest in July 2012, even
though real hardware is not yet available and will not be for many
months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the talk we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  outline our plan for converting the runtime JIT components of OpenJDK
to generate AArch64 code -- the (generated AArch64 code) template
interpreter and the C1/C2 JIT compilers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  explain how we have already managed to execute and debug generated ARM
code using our own ARMv8 functional simulator integrated into an x86 JVM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  display execution of a Java program using the template interpreter
running on our simulator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  show both ARM instruction-level and Java bytecode-level stepping and
debugging of generated code within gdb&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The PowerPC/AIX porting project currently driven by IBM and SAP is a
good example how the OpenJDK fosters the cooperation of different
players in the Java ecosystem in an open environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was initially started in June 2012 with the goal to
provide a full-featured and certifiable version of OpenJDK on the
Linux and AIX PowerPC platforms. By now the PowerPC/AIX port can
successfully run a couple of different standard benchmarks in mixed
mode (C++ interpreter plus C2 "server" JIT compiler) and passes the
JCK test on both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe what we've done to reach the current state and
what still needs to be done until we can integrate our port into the
main JDK8 code line which is the ultimate goal of the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since mid-2011 (when Gary Benson, the original author of Zero/Shark)
left Red Hat's Java team), the Zero interpreter and Shark compiler have
been basically unmaintained. A few months ago I picked up the project
and fixed the outstanding issues (related to changes in Hotspot and LLVM)
and started implementing a couple of significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give a short summary about what Zero and Shark actually
are, how they work, why they are relevant (even in the face of upcoming
full ports for PowerPC and others), how it fits in the OpenJDK
ecosystem, and then describe some of the more interesting details about
what I did, in particular improved support for atomic operations, JSR
292/invokedynamic, interesting optimizations in both the compiler and
the interpreter and more. Hopefully I will be able to present some
interesting ports to other platforms like ARM or PowerPC, some
benchmarks results as well as results from testsuites (TCK?). Finally,
I'll give an outlook to the future, things that need to be done, open
improvements, optimizations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to present current ideas about enabling the Java developer community to directly participate in the evolution of their favourite programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we briefly introduce 4 controversial Java features as seen by the research community: 1) Generics 2) Arrays 3) Wildcards 4) Overloading. We describe their intended purpose as seen by the language designers. Next, we describe what programmers actually do with them by looking at recent empirical studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we present a new platform (Wiggle) developed at the University of Cambridge that intends to democratise studies of language features in Java. We describe the technical architecture of the platform, the research and design decisions behind it. The audience will learn about Java source code query languages, graph databases and interesting recent development in the Java compiler. In addition, we will demonstrate a prototype in live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we present a recent idea about classifying Java language features based on different dimensions such as typical applications and conceptual complexity. We describe how such a classification could be useful both for collaborative development, software comprehension and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Having left the unsupportable "Java is Dead" narratives in the rear view mirror, the important question facing Java today isn't how popular it is: Java remains quite popular. Both the qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests that while Java has likely peaked from an overall popularity perspective, it remains an immensely robust, respected platform for building technology for businesses and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of greater concern for Java advocates, instead, should be how to ensure Java's continued growth, even in the face of an ever more competitive landscape. With even enterprise buyers sanctioning - tacitly or otherwise - the usage of runtimes like JavaScript, Python and Ruby the role of Java moving forward is an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because Java's not going away doesn't mean it's getting ahead. What can Java learn, then, from newly emerging competitive platforms? What are the drivers and characteristics behind the growth of these platforms and what, if anything, can Java learn from that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, I'll present a series of lessons, backed by quantitative data, that Java may want to take away to guarantee its momentum moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How did you learn to automate?  This will be a presentation and frank discussion that will explore how to help people become proficient with automation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We'll look at how Opscode, Puppet Labs, and CFEngine are approaching training.  We'll discuss how participants learned to automate.  What are the necessary pre-requisites?  What tools are essential to getting started?  What are the differences between getting started with automation for a project and joining a project with automation already in place?  Let's set aside our framework biases and figure out some ideas on how to get new people started with automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will give an overview of Ruby testing frameworks and how they can be used to test infrastructure code, such as Chef cookbooks, and test the infrastructure itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing Infrastructure Code
  - Quick run-down on libraries rspec, minitest, cucumber
  - Platform for testing modules or cookbooks is usually Vagrant but not necessarily
  - Is Cucumber for me?
  - why slow tests are a problem
  - testing quick and slow, quick tests w/ chefspec and slow integration tests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using minitest or cucumber
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Time permitting] Using RubyDNS and Sinatra to mock part of a Service-Oriented Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Testing Real and Almost real Infrastructure
  - Using rspec and Faraday to test HTTP services
  - Ideally would to like to show how u can use bunny to test your messaging infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Automating Security Policies, from deployment to auditing using Rudder</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Configuration Systems Management</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Designing, applying and keeping track of security-oriented rules for your IT infrastructure can be time-consuming, costly and approximate job. Whether you're in charge of defining the policy, implementing it or checking for discrepencies, you'll be aware that all of this takes time, often out-of-hours time, that there is a lot of room for error and usually a considerable gap between ideals and reality - just how big a gap may or may not be shared with everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how Rudder, an open source stack for automating configuration and auditing, can be used to ease and improve on several of these issues. Topics covered will include deploying identical settings everywhere, saving time for multiple changes, near real-time auditing of actual settings, gaining global overview to help analyze vulnerability impacts, and improved reactivity. I will include real-life examples and feedback from several companies where this has been put into action, including benefits (of course) and shortcomings (because there are always some).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this session is to discuss methods and the approach of automation applied to this field, while demonstrating and giving feedback on some of the possibilities offered by Rudder. I hope to avoid being side-tracked into talking about detailed security recommendations, sticking to simple best practices for the sake of examples, thus focusing on the approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;IT infrastructure, software projects and organizations are all systems that are required to be resilient, ie have the ability to absorb change, tolerate transients and maintain their self-organizing capacity in unexpected or even hostile circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As IT Engineers we are asked to build systems that are reliable, scalable and affordable. As Software Engineers we are required to deliver solutions that provide an excellent experience, are reusable and ready on time. As entrepreneurs, we want to build organizations that are performing, adaptive and lasting. IT infrastructure, software projects and organizations are all systems that are required to be resilient, ie have the ability to absorb change, tolerate transients and maintain their self-organizing capacity in unexpected or even hostile circumstances. In each of these domains we rely on techniques, tools and processes to manage these system in a predictable, repeatable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will propose that there are significant parallels between these disciplines, and that comparing the toolboxes, patterns and anti-patterns will suggest ways to improve our ability to build resilient IT systems as the industry moves towards Software Defined Infrastructure and embraces cultural shifts such as DevOps, blurring the lines between software, IT and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After 10 years in development, Samba4 has finally been released. What does this mean for existing Samba users, and how will it help us appeal to new users? Come listen to the co-creator of Samba talk about the latest release of the Samba codebase, including Active Directory Domain controller support, moving the core file serving protocol from SMB1 to SMB2 (and now to SMB3), how he got Microsoft to give a quote for the Samba4 press release :-) and other topics of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Firefox OS</title>
        <subtitle>A web-based FOSS OS</subtitle>
        <track>Beyond operating systems</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Firefox OS is the next product being developed by Mozilla. It's an open source OS based on the web and following the principals which have made the web a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll demo a phone running recent builds of Firefox OS (it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a finished product yet) and talk about the technologies and ideas behind Firefox OS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Firefox OS is an OS built entirely on web technologies using Open Source Software. Everything the user sees and interacts with is rendered using standard HTML and CSS and all application code is written in javascript, as is the implementation of many of the new APIs which are exposed to applications and web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind Firefox OS is to create an application platform which lets developers use technologies that they are familiar with from the web and that, as much as possible, create a development environment like the one used on the web. This means that to create an app, all you need to do is to set up a normal website and add a bit of metadata in a JSON file. Users can then "install" this website and get an experience similar to that on traditional OSes like Android or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ultimate goal is to have a standardized platform that allows for applications that can run on any OS and any device, just like web pages can run on any hardware that has a browser, while staying true to the technologies and philosophies which drive the web. No need to get approval from an app store, and no need to get locked into the platform of a particular vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will demo a phone running recent builds of Firefox OS (it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a finished product yet), as well as talk about the technologies and ideas behind Firefox OS and our experience building it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FreedomBox is a personal server running a free software operating system and free applications, designed to create and preserve personal privacy by providing a secure platform upon which federated social networks can be constructed. Software for FreedomBox is being assembled by volunteer programmers around the world who believe in Free Software and Free Society, with Bdale coordinating development of a reference implementation on behalf of the non-profit FreedomBox Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eben Moglen articulated the need for FreedomBox in his 2011 FOSDEM opening keynote, then Bdale Garbee provided a progress update in his 2012 FOSDEM closing keynote. This year, Eben and Bdale will jointly present the development status of freedom-respecting hardware and a software stack that together represent the first FreedomBox release for end users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Are you one of the people who has never installed Skype (and never will)?  Do you feel a sense of frustration every time someone asks to call you with Skype? Does the excruciating inefficiency of maintaining multiple profiles across Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn give you more pain than the sound of fingernails scratching a blackboard? Have you tried free and open source alternatives, but found their usefulness limited (or completely
failed to get them working)? Would you like to see a way out of this nightmare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the depth and breadth of VoIP and all other real-time communications, encompassing desktop VoIP, instant messaging, social networking, microblogging, server solutions and
also emerging areas like WebRTC, Peer-to-peer, privacy with FreedomBox and the mobile VoIP sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this broad agenda, the presentations from each speaker have been tightly coordinated with a coherent focus on the challenges of making it all work together comprehensively and conveniently. The speakers have come together for FOSDEM with the goal of mapping out a strategy for free and open communications standards to finally take their rightful place as the dominant paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers are the leaders in the flagship open source VoIP projects and will participate in a panel discussion and question/answer session in the telephony devroom immediately after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A series of stories about how we’ve tackled the huge challenges of updating an old code-base and giving it a bright future and the impact of large-scale code-change in that process on quality and features in 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come and hear how we’ve built an international team of developers to tackle the problems of resurrecting a poorly-understood, gigantic code-base extensively commented in German, with no unit tests, a tangled build infrastructure, and twenty-five years of un-paid technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear some stories of where we’ve come from - some comedy architectural disasters, and where we want to move to. Find out how you can get involved in that process. See the bug metrics, how we track our progress, regression counts, and the tooling we use to encourage participation and adapt the code. Does paying technical debt by significant, risky re-factoring pay? come and see the bug metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how we’ve innovated on top of this base with new features, new platforms and hear about some of the goodness in LibreOffice 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk will clarify how the GNOME community works, and answer several hot questions (GNOME OS, dependency on systemd, fallback mode, etc.) from the perspective of someone involved in the project for more than ten years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last year, GNOME has been a hot topic for many. The move to GNOME 3 comes with a different user experience, and the reaction to this new direction has been a mix of love and hate. If anything, such reactions show that people still care about the desktop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the future of GNOME raises several questions, and a lot of (often mis-informed) comments are the source of many theories. These questions are, of course, based on valid concerns: What is GNOME OS? Does GNOME target tablets instead of traditional computers nowadays? Is GNOME becoming less portable? Will GNOME depend on systemd? Can GNOME still run on non-3d-accelerated hardware? Does GNOME care about its user base or does it pursue a blue sky dream? What about the new GNOME-derived projects? etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to restore an understanding of (and maybe trust in?) how the GNOME community works and what it intends to achieve. The talk will also answer, in a honest, sometimes blunt way, as many of those questions as possible from the perspective of someone involved in the project for more than ten years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>keynote</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Whilst the mantra of free and open source software communities focuses on transparency and collaboration, community leaders will often find that the most significant conversations are those they have one-to-one and "behind closed doors". As a community leader, one is called upon to be both trusted confidant and change agent, and being effective in both roles simultaneously can be a quite difficult - and deeply humorous - dance. Join Leslie Hawthorn as she explores the nuances of public and private discourse in FOSS projects, using real world examples from her experience interacting with more than 200 communities over the past six years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders in communities that value openness and transparency are faced with a difficult challenge: people confide in you constantly, but your role as a leader is to promote positive change in your project; change only proceeds where information flows. How does one negotiate the need to maintain trust and harmony in the human sides of our interactions in development communities, while still ensuring that the social problems that may inhibit community progress are mitigated?  How does one manage to do all this while keeping one’s commitments to one’s friends and to project values like transparency and openness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Leslie Hawthorn will explore the role of secrets and disclosure in our open development communities. Specifically, she will explore how good leaders know when to discuss secrets, when to remain mum and, in particular, how to tell secrets "the right way". Drawing on six years of experience working with 100s of FOSS communities, she will discuss some of the most contentious and hilarious social problems she’s encountered and how they were addressed, with names and details omitted sufficiently well to keep her own commitments to confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This session will provide an introduction to how and why to use HipHop over PHP, and the benefits it offers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;By even the most conservative estimates, at least 50% of all websites on the Internet are powered by PHP, a language with a long and robust history of Open Source development principles.  And while PHP's virtual machine is extremely efficient at executing even the most "creative" scripts, it will simply never be able to compete with native code.  HipHop bridges that gap by translating easy to develop PHP scripts into high-speed, low-impact native code which can double, or even triple, the capacity of every node in your front end.  This drives down costs, and delivers faster content to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why, outside of Facebook and a few other installations, don't we see this taken advantage of?  There are some differences between HipHop and PHP, notably in the breadth of runtime extensions and namespaces.  Also, HipHop's documentation, while growing, still lags behind the massive body of work on php.net.  If you run more than one webserver however, it'll be worth 50 minutes to see what HipHop has been up to since we first introduced it at FOSDEM, how much easier it is to run a HipHop server in both production and development modes, and a little bit of how it works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Static website generators are slowly rising in popularity and have been proven to be a worthy alternatives to CMSes in many cases. This talk explains what static site generators are, how they avoid the traditional problems with CMSes, and explains what technical challenges must be overcome when implementing one.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the web, there were only static HTML files. This way of working proved to be hard to maintain, so people connected a database to their web sites, and in this way, CMSes were born. Today's CMSes are much more powerful than their ancestors, but they have brought a slew of drawbacks with them. Deployment has become harder, security is more of a sore point than ever, and speed issues are still hard to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CMS is overkill for many sites. Many drawbacks of CMSes can be aleviated by using a static site generator. These tools generate static HTML files and other static assets that can be deployed to any web host. They have recently gained a lot in popularity, and have proven to be a worthy alternative to CMSes in many cases. Even FOSDEM has, as of the 2013 edition, replaced Drupal with nanoc, a popular static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do static site generators work, precisely? How do they differ from traditional CMSes? What are their advantages and how do they resolve drawbacks that CMSes have? This talk gives answers to these questions, built on real-world experience received by creating several large web sites powered by static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How Aldebaran Robotics is using open source on their NAO robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk starts with a generic introduction to Aldebaran and its flagship product, the humanoid robot NAO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then give a small demo of what the robot can do, and how you can program it, all with open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we talk a little about the history of open source at Aldebaran: how it was first chosen as a tool;
the decision to use linux; the way we went from openembedded to buildbot and gentoo; the way we went from CDash to Jenkins, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, we will discuss the current open source projects Aldebaran is contributing to (connman for instance) and the tools Aldebaran decided to open source (like qiBuild).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of the Robot Operating System (ROS), an open software integration framework for robots.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2007, researchers at Willow Garage and Stanford University started work on a new open source software platform for robotics research and development. The platform was named ROS, for Robot Operating System (http://ros.org) and quickly gained traction in the research community. It has since become a de facto standard of robotics middleware, used by thousands of roboticists around the world. After five years of research and development, we are seeing the first ROS-based commercial products in the marketplace. It's an exciting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain what ROS is, and what it isn't. It will provide some context for the design of ROS, describe what people are doing with it, and outline some current and future directions for development. I will cover both technical design details and the community-centric features of the ROS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk describes how the automotive industry has moved to embedded Linux and Open Source to develop the next generation of In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) and how it has met the challenges along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk describes how the automotive industry has moved to embedded Linux and Open Source to develop the next generation of In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI). IVI is increasingly important as everyone wants to be connected all the time and cars are no exception. Cars are a natural fit for modern mobility software and customers expect that nearly anything they purchase nowadays has smart mobility baked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it happen that an industry known for its mechanical engineering and cautious approach can suddenly become a leader in smart mobility? How can the auto industry jump over a generation of consumer electronics and right into the smart phone era?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach is to join together, create a common platform, and innovate on top. This is what the GENIVI alliance has done. That common platform is embedded Linux and it comes with a number of challenges for the automotive industry. License compliance, fast start-up times, mobile connectivity to the internet, interaction with a wide variety of cell phones; all these things are challenges that the GENIVI alliance has tried to tackle head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss some the technical solutions, the resultant software stack, and the work that still needs to be done to realize modern IVI in every car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software has replaced mathematics as the modern language of Science, claimed Edward Seidel, the former director of the National Science Foundation Office of Cyberinfrastructure. However, unlike mathematical formulas, which can be written and read by anyone with enough knowledge in the field, software can be hidden behind black boxes and proprietary walls. A March 2012 article in Nature found that more than 90% of papers published in science journals describing "landmark" breakthroughs in preclinical cancer research, are not reproducible, and are thus just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk Bill Hoffman CTO and founder of Kitware Inc., will talk about the importance open source software, open access publication, and open data play in the advancement of scientific knowledge. The scientific process is currently hindered by closed source software, closed data, and closed scientific research publications. Much of this research is funded by public dollars and governments are starting to move in the right direction by requiring the practice of open science. Moreover, commercial enterprises are recognizing the many compelling business reasons to support open source including agility, quality, and community-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitware is a software company that creates and develops open source scientific computing software.  The software is used around the world for a variety of purposes including high-performance computing. Our business model is to engage in collaborative R&amp;amp;D, customize our open source software for particular applications, and to provide support for it including training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the FOSS community, Kitware is best known for the CMake build tool. CMake and the family of tools for testing and packing software play a key role in creating reproducible software based scientific research.  CMake itself came out of a US National Library of Medicine effort to create an open source toolkit for manipulating medical imagery.  This software process has been used to create an open access journal where the data and code are automatically tested and available to readers.  Open Source software combined with open publishing, open data, and software process provide the framework for a truly reproducible language of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FOSS community and the scientific research community mutually benefit from each others work, and yet often do not appreciate the connection that exists between them. This talk will trace some of the connections from FOSS to scientific research, and describe a future where the two communities are more closely aligned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lightweight software - where does performance matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An introduction to the FluxBB project, it's philosophy and the upcoming 2.0 release along with it's underlying framework.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FluxBB is a fairly little-known open-source forum software written in PHP. It offers only the absolutely essential features a forum software needs, focusing instead on stability and performance. Still, it is trusted by some of the biggest Linux distribution forums out there, and it's predecessor PunBB was used in the former Facebook Developer Forums. It was downloaded almost 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently overhauling the entire application, building on the modern Laravel framework in its not-yet-released fourth version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a framework instead of a home-grown, optimized solution is an interesting compromise between developer comfort (and development speed) and overhead that comes with the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot about why performance matters still with all the modern technology and especially where it matters and where it does not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EDE is desktop environment designed to be light in resource usage,
have known look and does not get in your way. It is running on
Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Minix and on devices like Zaurus or Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Popular desktop environments became resource hogs and are pretty much
unusable on older hardware and popular cheap devices like Raspberry Pi
and MK802. To run the latest KDE or GNOME versions, you will need
a powerful hardware with good graphic card, a similar requirements set
by modern 3D games. Isn't that sad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we are seeing increased interest in light window managers
and desktop environments in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDE belongs to the same group. Built on FLTK toolkit, library
originating in movie industry with design to be fast and easy to use,
EDE uses the similar principles brining full asynchronous desktop,
that starts up quickly, giving user familiar look and feel. With this,
user is focused on doing job not tuning environment to be usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give quick overview of project goals (why EDE is here
and why use FLTK), current status (what is done) and future plans
(can we have live environment).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An introduction to MetricsGrimoire and vizGrimoire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk provides a technical view of how to use, extend and contribute to the Metrics-Grimoire project, which produces a set of tools that can be used to analyze many kinds of software development repositories, from git or Subversion to Bugzilla, Jira or the SourceForge, GitHub and Launchpad issue trackers. Some related tools (from the vizGrimoire toolset) allow for different kinds of analysis and visualization of the retrieved data. When combined, quantitative data and charts about many different aspects of any free software project can be obtained, gaining knowledge about its evolution, performance, community, source code structure, etc. Being all the tools free software, the limit for the kind of analysis and visualizations is only the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FLOSS (free, libre, open source software) projects are usually developed in the open. A lot of information about their inner life is available in their development repositories: source code management (aka version control), issue tracking (aka bug reporting) systems, mailing lists, etc. This information can be organized and analyzed, and be used to gain understanding about how the project is performing, about the processes their developers are using, and in general about how it is evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of quantitative analytics that can be obtained from these repositories allow also for a direct tracking of several parameters that can characterize specific aspects of software development. The impact of changes in project policies or uses can therefore be evaluated quantitatively, and be observed in retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some websites that allow for some of these analysis, and some tools for supporting software development are also starting to offer some functionality along this line. But a more complete, holistic, flexible and customizable option is available: a set of free software tools that can extract information and metainformation from the most widely used kinds of software development repositories, store it in a database, and produce data and visualizations out of it. This talk will present it: the MetricsGrimoire toolset and its friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metrics-Grimoire project provides a set of tools that can be used to analyze many kinds of software development repositories, from git or Subversion to Bugzilla, Jira or the SourceForge, GitHub and Launchpad
issue trackers. Some related tools allow for different kinds of analysis and visualization of the retrieved data. Being all the tools free software, the limit for the kind of analysis and visualizations is only
the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will provide a technical view of the tools (written mainly in Python), how they can be used and extended, and how we're using them to produce detailed analysis about several free software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main tools that will be introduced are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;ul&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;CVSAnalY, which currently supports CVS, SVN and Git, while Bazaar and Mercurial are in the roadmap.
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;Bicho, currently supporting Bugzilla and the Google Code, GitHub, Jira, Launchpad, and Allura trackers.
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;MailingListStats, currently supporting files in mbox format and Mailman web-accesible archives.
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;VizGrimoire, a set of R scripts and JavaSript code to analyze and visualize the databases produced by the former tools.
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all these tools working together, automatic and semi-automatic analysis of software development projects is possible, at least to a certain extent. Developers can tailor and adapt them to suit their specific needs, track the parameters they are interested in, and analyze the specific aspects of their pet projects that they may want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions that could be answered by this combined use of the tools are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;ul&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;How has evolved the time-to-fix for bug reports over the whole history of a project?
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;How technical decisions affect attraction of new developers, time-to-attend for bug reports, or time to review changes to code?
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;li&gt;How can it be done a dynamic visualization of the evolution of a project?.
&amp;lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will show how in fact it is easy to have answers to this questions, with some practical examples of the analysis of real projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Formative evaluation using multiple choice questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eTests is a PHP/MySQL platform i developped during my PhD in science didactic at the University of Namur (http://webapps.fundp.ac.be/umdb/etests ) . It is used there since 3 years, and is now deployed at the Catholic University of Louvain (Louvain-la-Neuve and Wolluwe) (http://sites.uclouvain.be/etests ). This application offers opportunities to collaborative work on formatives as certificatives tests using multiple choices questions. It's not only a new quizz tool. It's a real university level research tool in education science, as it offers to teachers and reserchers tools to analyse answers in a global way and diagnose difficult topics and learning obstacles. As some PhD projects, I'm actualy alone to develop this platform. My goal in presenting it to FOSDEM is to find some interested developpers, at least to have technical as conceptual discussions about it, and with some chance, to find possibles teammates. The source code has been published on sourceforge under EUPL (European Union Public Licence version 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing the compatibility of all eGov services with Free Software client systems and helping governments reach a 100% Open Standards compliance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the eGov Testing Machine, which is referred to as the Free Software Client Reference System is to implement an automatic testing tool using Free Software to test eGovernment services to ensure everything is working under GNU/Linux systems, from smart cards used for authentication to online services that can be accessed by FOSS browsers. This is to help the local government and potentially other governments in Europe to reach a 100% Open Standards compliance. An automated testing machine has been developed using tools such as Selenium and Sikuli that can perform tests online without user interaction. Online services are systematically tested and user reports are generated which can be viewed online to identify any potential problems. These test results can then be used to solve issues that may arise when using FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;South Tyrol, which is an autonomous province located in the very north of Italy bordering on Austria and Switzerland, has recently implemented eGov services that are available to all citizens. A project called the Free Software Client Reference System has been started to test these online services and to make sure that the citizens of South Tyrol are not forced to own a proprietary operating system or that citizens are forced to buy proprietary software to access all eGoverment services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system uses virtual machines and open source automated testing tools. One scenario could have the following workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual machines get started automatically → User gets logged in → Browser gets started → Browser navigates to test site → Sikuli performs login with a smart card → Sikuli get stopped and Selenium gets started → Test Suites are run → Reports generated → Machine shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing governments with FOSS tools to test their own systems has a more strategic role. It is essential in supporting local governments to work with communities surrounding FOSS and to help with existing projects.
The Free Software Client Reference System is a project that does exactly this by building testing systems based on Free Software, furthermore it is being funded by the local government which is a great opportunity to create synergies between the public administration, FOSS communities in the area and hopefully connecting even more areas on a national and international level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FreeYourAndroid workshops - party like in the 90s with GNU/Linux&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSFE is running its FreeYourAndroid campaign and encourages everyone to do FYA workshops - Phone liberation parties like GNU/Linux parties in the 90s&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The FSFE is running its FreeYourAndroid campaign to help people to achieve users and software freedom on their mobile devices. Unfortunately, liberating phones is sometimes far from easy, including to root your device, unlock the bootloader, flash a custom ROM, get used to f-droid and much more ...
To help all those people out there, that lack a technical background but love to run Free Software on their mobile devices, the FSFE runs phone liberation workshops. These workshops are something, that everyone or every group can do. This talk will hopefully  encourage you to do so! Hence, the talk is about: What exactly are we doing in these workshops? How do we organise? How can we help you in doing the same? Where can you get more information?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Vendor everything; stay sane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendorificator is a tool that manages third-party (upstream) dependencies kept in project's Git repository. Using pristine orphan branches for each dependency, Git notes to store metadata, and tags for versions, it keeps track of origin, version, license, and other details of each of the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Vendorificator allows you to specify all of your project's upstream dependencies in one file, and keep them in your repository along with your code. Each of dependencies is kept in its own pristine branch, and annotated with metadata, so you can easily review all the upstream dependencies with version, origin, and other needed data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping each dependency in its own pristine branch lets you introduce your own patches to the upstream dependencies, keep track of them, and update any dependency to a newer version as easily as you do a normal Git merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendorificator is language-independent. It can handle Ruby gems, Python modules, JavaScript files, CSS frameworks, Chef cookbooks - all the external dependencies are specified in one place and stored together with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendor everything. Stay safe from third-party downtimes - keep your project running and deployable when Github/Rubygems/Pypi goes down, author pulls the old version you still need to use from the "downloads" page or moves the download URL around, or you just want the project runnable out-of-the-box right after git pull, without waiting for all the dependencies to download.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;10 proposals to get you started in the MediaWiki community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annoyed by some detail? Suffering some bug? Missing some feature? Having a cool idea? Wondering what comes next? Here you have the top 10 activities that you can start right here right now.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You use Wikipedia. Maybe you donate to Wikipedia. Maybe you even edit Wikipedia. Or any other Wikimedia project: Commons, Wiktionary, Wikiversity... Since you are in FOSDEM chances are that you know what is MediaWiki. Maybe you are using it in some website or intranet. Maybe you even are a MediaWiki admin. Or maybe you even installed it once...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we just came here to say that being a Wikipedia reader AND a FOSDEM attendee you simply qualify as technical contributors to one of the most amazing collaborative projects happening now. Annoyed by some detail? Suffering some bug? Missing some feature? Having a cool idea? Wondering what comes next? Here you have the top 10 activities that you can start right here right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The list will go through 10 examples of tasks for developers, testers, designers, sysadmins, doc writers, and even product and marketing people! A page in mediawiki.org will list these tasks and point to the right places to get you started).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you saw the dark side. You smelled the red pill. No matter what you do (or don't do), reading Wikipedia will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How the TYPO3 project ensures code quality through peer-reviews using "Gerrit Code Review"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Gerrit Code Review" is an open-source software and acts as a gatekeeper in front of the Git repositories. Gerrit ensures submitted code to be approved by multiple persons and optionally also Continuous Integration systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gerrit has been developed by Google for Android development. It is used by several companies and open-source projects, including Eclipse, OpenStack, and TYPO3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents Gerrit itself and the workflow and lessons learned in a big, community-driven open-source project: the TYPO3 project. Gerrit is used here for all top-level projects (TYPO3 CMS, TYPO3 Flow, TYPO3 Neos) since two years to handle every single code change. In addition to human reviews, automatic tests in Jenkins and TravisCI are executed. Gerrit brings transparency into our community-driven project and allows everybody to participate by pushing patches and voting for/against any change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Straightforward audio file tagging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EasyTAG is a GTK+-based audio file tagger, which was first released in 2000. It has recently seen a rejuvenation of development, and new contributors would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;EasyTAG was maintained by Jérôme Couderc from 2000-2008, but he had less and less time to spend on the project, which languished somewhat on SourceForge until it was moved to gnome.org in late 2012. After a rush of new development, this talk will cover the current state and future direction of the project, as well as useful lessons that can be learned from taking over an unmaintained project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Make sounds from sounds &amp;amp; fingers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borderlands is a cross platform Granular Sequencer. Improves communication &amp;amp; interface enables to use it with any controllers, or without!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Granular Sequencer is an addictive audio concept : picking parts of audio samples, near randomly, applying filters then  playing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way of playing music is possible with lots of tools, but there is no fun in them. Borderlands has huge possibilities &amp;amp; contains a lot of attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forked the original work  from Chris Carlson, improving interface, adding features, &amp;amp; communication possibilities (OSC,Midi, TUIO). The idea is to build something between the tool &amp;amp; the toy, but that you can use without a manual, totally instinctively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As everything is controlable, you can manage your performance with a MIDI controller (korg nanokontrol...), an OSC interface (Android touchOSC...), or a reactable !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the versatility of this project has many interest centers :
Musicians : making live performance, creating new sounds ...
Artists : generating ambiance, controlled by audience....
Schools : Discovering the tool, the code, &amp;amp; sound manipulation
Everyone : This idea interests people working with children with difficulties (intellectual, social...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project has great potential, will be developped with other new features, and has to be spread all over the world !&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Interactive musical improvisation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazzperiments is an open source Java application which enables musicians to have an interactive 'jam' with their computer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you sing, whistle or play an instrument and your computer plays along ... not just a like a dull 'rhythm box' with some ever repeating chords, but really interactive, following your own free improvisation. Jazzperiments is a project to achieve just this, open source, based on the beautiful Gervill JavaSound library of Karl Helgason (FOSDEM veteran).
The system is described in detail and actually online on www.jazzperiments.com ... ready to try out or even use in performances ... click on JAM&gt; and start 'jamming'.
However as the system works better and better there are more and more options to improve and extend it: new user interfaces (something with a camera would be very nice to 'direct' the app), reducing latency, even more tricks with live samples etc. etc.
If you combine love for programming and music (and who doesn't?) a lightning talk is long enough to challenge you to participate in any way ... and it's not just a talk ... there will even be time for a lightning concert/jam ...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The advent of IaaS has brought about a new style of application
architecture built around the idea that the components of your
architecture should be fine-grained programmable resources. This allows
applications to be resilient and scalable, but also allows the operation
of the application to be fully automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark will discuss how OpenStack was designed from the ground up with
these same principles in mind and can be deployed in a highly resilient
and fault tolerant manner. Mark will go on to explain how you should aim
to build on OpenStack's architecture so that operating an OpenStack
cloud is as automated as operating a modern cloud based application.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will present Apache CloudStack, a project currently in incubation at the Apache Software Foundation. CloudStack is a IaaS solution enabling users to build public or private clouds. We will briefly review the "Apache Way" that governs the CloudStack project and present the ecosystem that is taking shape. We will then dive into the key features of CloudStack: Hypervisor agnosticity, multiple storage backends like Ceph, GlusterFS, Software Defined Networking and couple other interesting ones.  We will then present three extremely useful utilities to test and manage a CloudStack base cloud. Namely: DevCloud, a sandbox that provides an all-in-one environment to develop and test CloudStack code, Marvin, a Python framework for integration testing which also provides a Python binding to the CloudStack API and finally we will present CloudMonkey the new command line interface built on Marvin.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present an overall view of the project while highlighting key technical features and great utilities for users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a world where Cloud IaaS providers are popping up on every street
corner, it becomes increasingly important to prevent vendor lockin.
Several efforts are already underway in projects like DeltaCloud to help
abstract away the differences in API's and allow consumers to be cloud
agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the desire for cloud agnosticism becomes increasingly
challenging when we start thinking about managing images.  Not only do
we have API differences, but also many cloud vendors require differing
formats and importation methods, some requiring uploading of pre-built
images, others snapshots of running instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk addresses some of the issues surrounding image management in a
federated cloud environment and introduces Aeolus Image Factory; a
project that offers image management abstraction for multitude of Cloud
vendors.  Aeolus Image Factory allows users to define images at a high
level and have them built, pushed and registered with all the major
cloud vendors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Introduction of the Synnefo cloud platform. Synnefo is a complete cloud stack providing Compute/Network/Image/File/Volume services over OpenStack compatible APIs. It is running in production for over a year now, powering the ~okeanos public cloud service for the Greek Research and Education Network, GRNET. It uses Google Ganeti for the low level VM management part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General architecture and components used (Django, Ganeti, KVM, RADOS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking: IPv4/IPv6 public networks, how to scale the number of isolated virtual private LANs to the thousands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a content-addressable file storage service as the Image repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unified storage of files, VM Images and live VM disks, independently of the backend storage technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thin provisioning of VMs over such infrastructure (no NAS/SAN), with zero copies while in the same time keeping support for live migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advantages to running a production service on Synnefo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Industry and Open Source Community use cases of Synnefo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production readiness/Scalability/Maintainability on commodity hardware&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>StratusLab: Darn Simple Cloud</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Cloud</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;StratusLab (http://stratuslab.eu) is an open source (Apache 2.0) IaaS cloud
distribution, providing a complete IaaS solution that is simple to install and
use. The StratusLab collaboration, started in 2008, benefited from European
funding from 2010 to 2012. The collaboration is open to contributions from
individual developers and institutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StratusLab provides features for dynamic management of the typical computing
resources of a IaaS cloud. But its image sharing model, allowing trusted
sharing of user-created images, stands out as a unique feature of the
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute - fast provisioning, low-latency start-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage - EBS-like persistent writes, snapshots, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network - public and private networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniform, flexible system for authentication and authorization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Marketplace for trusting and sharing machine images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools for simplifying image creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Command-line clients (written in Python) allow users to control their cloud
resources, as well as allowing system administrators to install, manage and
upgrade their cloud. All services provide straightforward APIs to allow
programmatic access to StratusLab services by developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration runs two reference cloud services, available to open source
project and academics, that allow quick evaluation of the features of the
StratusLab cloud distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the current status of the StratusLab solution, explains its
driving design principals and describes the roadmap for the upcoming releases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll run through the major security requirements expressed by
cloud users that OpenStack currently doesn't meet. We'll run through real
world examples of how OpenStack can be attacked or subverted due to
weaknesses in design and discuss how the OpenStack Security Group is working
to improve current security controls and deliver new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Deploying complex systems on OpenStack can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small website running MediaWiki can happily fit on a single server, but the same software running at the Wikipedia scale is much more demanding. You need to deal with multiple database servers, webservers, load balancers, failover, networking configuration, IP address assignment and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heat project allows you to describe all the resources and their relationships in a single template, launch everything with one command and keep it up. You can easily combine the workflow with existing configuration management tools such as Puppet or Chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially modeled after Amazon CloudFormation, Heat is a free and open source component for OpenStack and has recently been accepted into OpenStack incubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will provide an overview of Heat's capabilities and how to use them, followed by a live demonstration. At the end you will understand Heat well enough to decide whether it is useful in your environment and how to get started with it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>SlapOS, an efficient all-in-one cloud</title>
        <subtitle>With a case study of porting the collaborative Extranet Mioga.</subtitle>
        <track>Cloud</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SlapOS aims for an efficient, decentralised, Free Software cloud with higher resilience and improved privacy. It is developed by a community including companies (Alixen, Bull, Dashing Soft, Nexedi, ViFiB, ZP Web Sites) and academia (Telecom ParisTech, University of Paris XIII)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SlapOS model is based on standard Unix process/user separation. SlapOS can thus implement a wider range of Cloud models: virtual machine models, IaaS models, containers, instances, bare-metal PaaS among others. Nodes can be distributed geographically among different data centers and companies, or even into people's homes (self hosting). Software can also be deployed on more than 42 public clouds, even to create a Cloud federation where each infrastructure can back up another one. Billing is built into SlapOS through ERP5, the open source ERP, which acts as a process orchestrator and gives full independence. Other building blocks are Buildout to manage applications and supervisord for the monitoring. Documentation, forum and code repositories are available at community.slapos.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mioga, the collaborative Extranet by Alixen, permits document sharing within inter- and intra-organisational workgroups through a fine-grained permission system. It complements an existing messaging system by providing groupware services: workgroup management, directory service integration, WebDAV or web-based document access, meta-data search, calendars, and many others. The source code (GPL) is available at www.alixen.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduce the main SlapOS concepts through simple examples using the command line: adding a node and requesting deployment of simple services like a database or a virtual machine in different regions of the world; then transforming our own computers, phones or some EC2 virtual machine into a SlapOS server and requesting deployment of ten LAMP applications inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take Mioga as an example for how to port an existing, complex web application to the SlapOS cloud, be it for a SaaS offer or for internal usage (load-balancing and better use of spare servers). We can show code examples from all steps: from the Buildout "recipes" for components like PostgreSQL or Perl modules to the Slaprunner integration interface and recipes for both software and instance deployment. Administrative tasks such as supervision and backups can be fully automatised and integrated into the deployment recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SlapOS community would like to spread awareness and encourage participation. We conclude with an outlook of further work on security and robustness, welcoming questions and input of all kind.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ceilometer is an OpenStack incubated project which started in April 2012
with the goal to provide a unique interface point to provide measurement
in OpenStack.  Our purpose for measurement started with a focus on
metering (for billing) and has since been extended to other targets such
as monitoring and alerting.  This project is a collaboration of a wide
variety of actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief introduction of the project past and future, this talk
will introduce the audience to the project's architecture before digging
into how and why they can contribute to its future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Home Automation solutions are appearing every day to make our everyday lives easier and simpler but still lack the greater vision. Interfacing them and building complex applications is still hard, mainly due to proprietary hardware and communications protocols. Open source and community based solutions are the key to overcome the aforementioned limitations. To prove that Open Source is the solution we decided to upgrade various devices to smart-objects using open protocols and the concepts and directives of Future Internet.
We will present all the levels of the architecture of our system to fit our greater vision of an Open Source Home automation System. We deal with low level Arduino-based smart adapters, communication protocols, the storage mechanism for logging and data aggregation and the high level applications (e.g., Android, Windows Phone) and interfaces to control and monitor our local hackerspace.
All parts of our installation are open source and available for everyone to use and extend.
Some of the technologies we used include CoAP for low level wireless communication, RESTful web interfaces and Semantic Descriptions to integrate them with the Web.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An accelerometer device is normally underestimated by designers
and software architects in the mobile industry. It's usually
considered as a simple device mainly responisble for detecting
the "position of the device in the space".
The most common use case is orientation detection. However modern
accelerometers can offer much more, things like gesture
recognition and improved games experience.
This talk will describe the use cases on how to implement the
drivers and how to take advantage of the new features offered by
some modern sensors. It will also describe what to take into
account to simplify the software stack and reduce power
consumption."&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are many different linux distributions out there, but only few of them are really targetting for a mobile devices. Nemo Mobile is one of these mobile oriented open source distributions. It is based on very flexible and mobile oriented Mer Core and has UI developed with Qt/QML. Nemo Mobile targets mobile devices such as phones and tablets and has currently adaptations for devices including n900, n950 and n9 as well as some x86 devices and virtual machine support. There are also many other devices out there that have already preliminary adaptations that can be worked with. The development is done fully in the open and we welcome every user and contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ask what it takes to port Nemo Mobile/Mer to new hardware, answer to this question is approached in this presentation. During the presentation listener will get information about the parts where implementation for each adaptation is needed. For example graphics, phone, sensors and audio need some adaptation work to get the features working. Examples of packaging a kernel and graphics libraries are shown with the tools that make it easier to get all the features included.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The new 64-Bit ARM architecture (official abbreviation Aarch64) is coming with strong Linux support. This talk details typical changes that applications need to build and run on Aarch64. Aarch64 leaves behind many of the idiosyncrasies of 32-Bit ARM for a new clean start, thus making porting easier in many cases. GCC and Autoconf provide tools to make code adapt using the "detect feature, not platform" philosophy. In this talk we dive into both Aarch64 specific changes needed and general portability tips. Many of instructions provided should be helpful for porting GNU/Linux applications to any new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The combination of innovative software and hardware, the very basics of embedded and mobile development, can establish a patentable invention. It is commonly understood that software patents are not granted in Europe, and that inventions in the form of software programs are not patentable. Both assumptions are not completely true, and can be especially misleading for the development of mobile and embedded appliances. The presentation will inform about the special case of innovations made up of a combination of software and hardware inventions, and the can of worms this opens for embedded and mobile developers. It will introduce defensive strategies available to Open Source embedded and mobile developers, especially the creation of defensive publications and the Open Source patent pool built by the Open Invention Network.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>From kernel to the administrators and the users</subtitle>
        <track>Cross distro</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Network configuration scripts proved insufficient in modern environments. NetworkManager has been too focused
on desktop and laptop usage. Alternative projects including netifd, netcfg, connman, wicd and wicked are not
production-ready for servers either. It is possible to have a single network management daemon serving desktops,
laptops, servers and virtualization hosts alike? What features should it support? What are the expectations
of the community? Can network configuration in Linux distributions suck less? Bring your own questions, too.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover current networking problems from kernel to the administrators and users, as well as the
current development in this field with the focus on NetworkManager's ongoing transition from a wireless connection
configurator to a full-fledge operating system deamon. One of the main topics will be about the reasons to
have a network configuration daemon at all and about decisions that affect its usability for various use
cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's purpose is not only to inform the open source community but also to gather the community to a larger-scale
networking round table. We already tried to do this on a smaller scale and it proved good. I expect follow-up
discussions to evolve and to contribute to the effort to make network-related projects more community-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux network management is already changing. Your choice is whether to participate on the change and influence it,
or just wait for the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The present status of Cloud and Virtualised Machine instances is very chaotic;
different Vendors doing their own thing, every hypervisor needing its own magic
and various cloud instances imposing their own site requirements. The RainDrops
project aims to reduce the impact this has on users, giving them a unified
interface ( web, git and REST ) that they can define their requirements
against. And let the system handle the various requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we aim to define the scope of the problem and demonstrate
our solution. Our demo will consist of defining a single kickstart file, and
then using that to build multiple instances for different vendors and
technologies, with very little effort and no vendor specific configs needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raindrops project has been in development and closed testing upto this
point, we hope to use the Fosdem talk to launch it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The TeX environment has grown slowly but steadily to a huge collection
of programs, fonts, macro packages, support packages. Current TeX Live
ships about 2Gb in more than 2000 different "TeX Live packages".
As teTeX stopped to be developped and supported several years ago,
TeX Live has taken over as the main TeX distribution in practical all
areas, not only on Unix, but also Mac (MacTeX is based on TeX Live)
and is also gaining on Windows (where MikTeX is still strong).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Integrating TeX Live into any distribution is a non-trivial task due
to big amount of post installation tasks that have to be performed.
Although over the last years the quality of packages has improved,
we (TeX Live development list) still get often bug reports that stem
from incorrect packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents in an overview the structure of TeX Live and the
list of important and special configuration files. Furthermore, base
on the experience of packaging TeX Live over many years, we will give
advise and best practice examples. The talk is targetted not only at
Debian, but at any distribution that redistributes TeX Live in one
way or another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After extending Debian with two new kernels, Debian will soon be able to
be built with a new free C, C++ and Objective-C compiler called Clang.
Based on LLVM, this compiler is now close to gcc on many different
aspects (performances, build time, level of support of C and C++). This
talk will present the current status of a clang-build version of Debian,
the next steps and evolutions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux in general, and Debian in particular, is a popular system for
large-scale deployments, and that includes desktop machines. However,
the internals of GNOME and its supporting frameworks, which are useful
knowledge for the system administrator, are not well-known. This talk
will look into permissions management, configuration mechanisms,
networking configuration, the virtual filesystem, and other things to
know about administrating GNOME in general, and its specificities in
Debian.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Internet privacy and numeric data control are parts of current hot topics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Internet is being centralized by private companies and users are becoming products. We believe that self-hosting could be a good answer to that problem. In many country like France or Germany, self-hosting is no more technically a dream, but knowledges required to configure a server at home remain significants. With YunoHost, we provide a simple solution to host your mail, jabber and web server at home, and easily install web applications and services to extend capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A method for distributing applications independent from the distro</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Cross distro</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For many years the linux distro concept has been about
"inclusion of applications" sometimes at the detriment to
co-habitating applications and the stability of the core OS. Much
discussion has been made over the years about JEOS, embedded Linux,
custom distros, applicance building, etc, but not a lot of discussion
about how applications could be delivered such that they were more
readily able to co-habitate. In a related note, open source
applications (because distros are so "inclusive") are put through
significant scrutiny around their design and deployment related to
their integration with the core OS that may or may not make sense. The
scrutiny is certainly more intense than proprietary software is
required to undergo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are proposing a panel discussion around a solution called "Software
Collections." Software Collections have been adopted by Red Hat and
are under consideration by other distros as a solution to the
application delivery problem. Questions include, is this a good
solution? Can multiple distros adopt one solution (or are there
inherent differences)? Can multiple distros, potentially, even
leverage the same package for an application?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

implemented using a private cloud: OpenNebula. We will focus on the challenges
of integration, advantages and workflow. We will also demonstrate how to
implement and automate a building system and QA tasks by creating a private
cloud on the fly with a CentOS laptop using OpenNebula. Administrators will
benefit from this technique -and its simplicity and ease of deployment- to
overcome the complexity of this kind of systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For many years, syslog-ng was part of many distributions but stuck at ancient software versions. My task was to help distributions to update their syslog-ng packages and now to keep them updated. This is a two way process, as while distros receive many help, we also get a lot of useful feedback and ideas, which influence the development of syslog-ng.
Using syslog-ng as an example, I'll try to show how upstream can work with distributions for the benefit of both sides.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How do we make "Qt on Mer" the solution of choice for device vendors?</title>

        <track>Cross distro</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Covering Mer's birth, the MeeGo years and how we now work in a truly
collaborative and open project to make Mer productizable.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mer supports organizational collaboration; our vendor focus drove the design
from the project structure through the architecture, the deliverables and the
processes. We continuously ask "How will this decision affect vendors using our
solution to make a product?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mer delivers a world-class platform for building products: after all, it's an
ultra-modern Linux stack with a strong upstream focus that partners with a
world-class graphical framework; it rocks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll explain why "code is not enough"; what else we deliver and how we ensure
that the code, policies and processes you tell your customers to use are up to
the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the details of Mer and QtCreator; how the cross-compilation and emulation
works in the Mer SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some future goals for Mer and our collaborators and a demonstration of
some technology that is guaranteed to be of interest to people looking to build
Qt products now, on hardware shipping today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How GNOME Obsoleted its "Enable Accessibility" Setting</title>
        <subtitle>(And How You Can Too)</subtitle>
        <track>Cross desktop</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to use your computer, tablet, or phone and being unable to: not due to a dead battery or lack of connectivity, but rather because there was some setting... somewhere... which you had to locate and enable on that device before you could use that device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unfortunate catch-22 is something that GNU/Linux users with disabilities have had to struggle with for years, because using the accessibility features of their environment required first enabling accessibility support for that environment -- or find someone to do so for them. And yet there was nothing these users could do to change this situation because enabling accessibility support by default would result in instability and performance degradation for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNOME has long felt that this was a condition which could not continue, and slowly but surely began identifying and tackling these issues. In 2012, things had improved to the point that the developer community felt confident that enabling accessibility support by default was something worth attempting. The end result: GNOME 3.6 was the first GNU/Linux graphical desktop environment to be released with no ""enable accessibility"" setting. For our users, accessibility is always on.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of the steps we took to make our desktop environment immediately accessible to users with disabilities without any associated negative impact on other users. And it will include the specific steps you need to take to accomplish the same thing for the software you develop, because software freedom should include the freedom to ""just use"" your devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;KDE is the largest Free and Open Source community writing Qt software. Its large portfolio of applications for a wide spectrum of domains has lead to an equally wide spread spectrum of libraries for general functionality, platform integration and domain specific tasks. Qt application developers are often not aware of what is available or are uncertain what dependencies an interesting library might have. This talk will introduce two KDE initiatives to address those needs: Inqlude, a repository for Qt libraries, and KDE Frameworks 5, a reorganization of KDE's libraries into a modular structure with fewer, cleaner and better documented dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A critical area on the open source desktop needs serious improvement: the developer experience. There are major barriers to entry for new developers and ongoing challenges even for those of us who have been involved for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes much more time and effort to keep one's code working on top of constantly-changing open source dependencies than it should. Platforms change (in subtle and not-so-subtle ways) more often than they claim. And, all too often, we change our code without adequately checking that we didn't break something in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will examine the current state of the developer experience on the open desktop and discuss processes and policies that we can use to improve it (particularly, automated testing). It will focus on the experience for new developers, maintaining a stable platform (more so than we do now), and guaranteeing code quality. The speaker will address the topic from his perspective as a Gnome developer but the talk will explain concepts broadly applicable to any open source platform or project. As FOSDEM will immediately follow the Gnome Developer Experience Hackfest, this talk will also incorporate conclusions from that conference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment 0.17 was finally released on December 21 2012. This finally marks a return from focusing on libraries only to continuing windowmanager and desktop and applications. Enlightenment covers much more than just a window manager now, and it will be useful for the desktop users and community to know how much more and why. This will cover the current status of Enlightenment, it's features, what it's missing, what it's strengths and weaknesses are. It will also cover the direction of EFL, where it is at now and going in the future and how this relates to Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the Qt Project was established to drive the future development of the project: a true Open Source project with an open governance model, based on the models found in mature open source communities like the Linux kernel and  WebKit, both of which support a large commercial ecosystem like Qt does. During the year 2012, the project has proven its worth, surviving turbulent changes and releasing several Qt 4.8 patch releases and the 5.0 major release. It has managed to do that through the dedication of its community and through the structure established last year, which may be unfamiliar to many customers of Qt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will present the set up of the Qt Project, showing how a developer can approach the community with ideas and contributions. It will show how the project is set up and how the development and release processes work. Finally, it will present some success stories of how an Open Source project can have commercial interests in harmony.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The presentation will start with a brief panoramic of Adhearsion 2 and how to connect an app to a voice platform, then moving on to real life use cases. A quick look at the future with WebRTC and browser-based services will then let us find out where technology is heading.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Adhearsion is a voice application framework that allows Ruby developers to build complex systems on top of Asterisk, FreeSWITCH and other VoIP platforms, used in the industry for very heterogeneous purposes. Most of it happens behind the scenes and inside calls, through IVR menus and with the notoriously complex CDR output acting as the only trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will start with a brief panoramic of Adhearsion 2 and how to connect an app to a voice platform, then moving on to real life use cases such as pushing events to a browser or a queue, robo-dialing with real time status reporting, and authenticating users by phone number or PIN through a Web API. A quick look at the future with WebRTC and browser-based services will then let us find out where technology is heading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While Asterisk has made itself known as a SIP implementation that can interoperate with virtually any other SIP implementation this has come at a cost of increased developer burden and reduced feature set. To propel Asterisk further into the future, a new SIP module is being developed which focuses on building a sustainable SIP implementation for the next 10 years. This talk will focus on explaining the new approaches that will be taken with this module, how it can be expanded and maintained, and how you too can help bring new SIP grounds to the Asterisk community!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As VoIP protocols have come and gone SIP has remained the most dominant throughout the world. It has been implemented by countless individuals across countless devices. It has enjoyed being expanded by numerous other specifications which have increased its feature set and compatibility in different situations. It shows no sign of slowing down, yet. While Asterisk has made itself known as a SIP implementation that can interoperate with virtually any other SIP implementation this has come at a cost of increased developer burden and reduced feature set. To propel Asterisk further into the future a new SIP module is being developed which focuses on doing things differently. This SIP module will use an existing SIP stack and several new fundamental approaches for module development within Asterisk which will allow more freedom for developers to implement the key features they want quickly and easily in a completely modular fashion. This talk will focus on explaining the new approaches that will be taken with this module, how it can be expanded and maintained, and how you too can help bring new SIP grounds to the Asterisk community!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation consists of two parts. The first will discuss how OpenSIPS acts in the context of a distributed VoIP platform. The second will focus on practical examples of OpenSIPS deployments and how to solve real world problem such as distributed load balancing, distributed rate limiting, and interaction with external applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We would like to split our allocated time in two parts: the first one will present the OpenSIPS server in the context of
distributed VoIP Platforms - the challenges we have encountered and the solutions we have designed in order to overcome them. We will present how to build a geo-distributed scallable platform with OpenSIPS, and will also concern about security issues, monitoring and integration. In the second part we are planning to assist the slides with some practical examples, that will conclude the topics presented above. A short list of demos we have in mind is: distributed rate limiting, distributed load balancing, as well as techniques for interacting with external applications, like monitoring or taking self-protecting actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the Jitsi project's evolution of handling multi-party video conferencing. There are various approaches to handling multi-party video conferencing, and the Jitsi project approaches the problem in a fashion similar to Skype and Google. This has culminated in a new XMPP server component that focus agents can control via dedicated XMPP IQs: Jitsi Videobridge.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago the Jitsi project developers started work on support for video conference calls. We had had audio conferencing for a while at that point and we were using it regularly in our dev meetings. Video seemed like a logical next step so we rolled our sleeves and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first choice that we needed to make was how to handle video distribution. The approach that we had been using for audio was for one of the participating Jitsi instances to mix all flows. That's easy to do for audio streams and any recent machine can easily mix a call with six or more participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video however was a different story. Mixing video into composite images is an extremely expensive affair and one could never achieve this real-time with today's desktop or laptop computers. We had to choose between an approach where the conference organizer would simply switch to the active speaker or a solution where a central node would relay all streams to all participants, while every participant keeps sending a single stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally went for the latter which also seems to be the approach taken by Skype and Google for their respective conferencing services. We started by implementing all this in Jitsi but along the way we also decided to make the RTP relaying part a separate server-side component. This is how Jitsi Videobridge was born: an XMPP server component that focus agents can control via dedicated XMPP IQs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The latest generation HEP (HEPv3) has been designed with much more than SIP in mind, and can now encapsulate just about any signaling protocol such as H323, IAX, SS7, control protocols like MGCP, MEGACO as well as RTP / RTCP statistics. As a unique feature HEPv3 is able to send custom defined parameters specific to a growing list of vendors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest generation HEP (HEPv3) has been designed with much more than SIP in mind, and can now encapsulate just about any signaling protocol such as H323, IAX, SS7, control protocols like MGCP, MEGACO as well as RTP / RTCP statistics. As a unique feature HEPv3 is able to send custom defined parameters specific to a growing list of vendors. For instance, Asterisk can decide to send additional information about a specific channel (ie: bridge id, billing id, etc) independent of other platforms/vendors, natively and within the same encapsulation protocol. HEPv3 also fully supports streaming protocols (TCP/SCTP) and presents no MTU or defragmentation challenges and was ultimately designed for total scalability, making it perfect to be deployed in both classic and modern cloud scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An real life example is "Homer in the Cloud", a service created around HEPv3 allowing anyone to sign-up and immediately start feeding their HEP encapsulated traffic from their networks over to cloud servers to analyze/troubleshoot/share the database remotely and securely from anywhere using just their browser (based on webHomer OSS) delivering results with zero setup and maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SIP and XMPP are the two main protocols used nowadays for realtime communications with presence and instant messaging. They both offer similar features even though their development started quite differently. They both coexist and the interoperability between the two is key in order to offer a communications solutions which covers a broader number of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of time several gateways have been built to convert SIP to XMPP (and the other way around) but never in a fully transparent way. SylkServer implements a transparent gateway for SIP and XMPP. It's Open Source and during the talk I'll comment on its design, what advantages it has and what problems had to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when all mobile broadband modems spoke AT commands over serial ports, and PPP was used to establish a network connection. Soon, each vendor ended up with its own AT dialect or, even worse, a completely new protocol: phonet, QCDM, QMI, WMC, MBIM... This talk is a general overview of these protocols, how and why they have evolved over time, and their current implementation and usage in Linux-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The LibreOffice template repository is currently created using Plone and an add-on named Plone Software Center. Many contributors to the templates repository find it to complicate to upload and publish a template on the site, because they had to create a project and then a release for every new template version. Only afterwards they could upload their template onto the site. It's currently not possible to translate the project pages (and sub pages) or e.g. the categories of the projects. Thus I started to work on a new add-on for a LibreOffice template center that has a more flat hierarchy and make it possible to translate the projects (and sub pages) as well as the categories of the projects into different languages. The presentation will show the current state of this Upgrade of the LibreOffice templates site.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Governments on a local and European level work to create eGovernment services that are accessible to all citizens, independent from the operating system and applications they use. This means providing forms that are in an open format and that can be used with FOSS tools. Providing forms and documents in proprietary formats makes it difficult for FOSS users to make use of the full potential of the services that are offered online. The Free Software Client Reference System is a tool used to help local governments ensure that all the services that are provided to citizens are compatible with FOSS. The goal here is to ensure that every citizen does not need to own a proprietary system to access eGovernment services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

By reusing the gtk builder format this means that LibreOffice dialogs can now be edited visually with glade with immediate results, instead of the traditional; blind-edit, compile, run and profuse swearing, development cycle of the legacy .src format. Here's a tutorial in how to convert an existing dialog to .ui format. Tip, tricks and common design patterns to help you get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you are a Linux developer, but need to check your LibreOffice code on Windows from time to time, this is the session for you! Cross-compiling LibreOffice for Windows using MinGW is trivial, and you can even directly run the result on your Linux machine without having to upload the results to a virtual host, or to a Windows machine. You can use your familiar environment during development, and also the build times are shorter than on real Windows. This How-To session will help you to set up the environment for cross-compilation, and will show few tricks you should learn.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the Google Summer of Code, in collaboration with re-lab, LibreOffice community started to open to the broader free-software ecosystem several proprietary file-formats. This talk will present the libraries for parsing Visio (libvisio), CorelDraw (libcdr) or MS Publisher (libmspub) documents that are currently used by several free-software projects. The talk will focus on interesting details of reverse-engineering, and explain our method of "incremental" reverse-engineering which allowed us to open the file-formats of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; CorelDraw versions. The same method is currently used to open the file-formats of all remaining versions of MS Visio. The talk will also present some of the introspection tools we develop and use. Those tools are free-software and their use goes beyond the reverse-engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>LibreOffice</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One major problem that is hard to fix with the current core data structures of Writer is anything that relates to tracking of changes - undo and change-tracking (redlining) itself. It is because the data structures use naive approach to the document - there is one array of 'nodes' (BigPtrArray), and additional data structures that take care of the changes. There are editors that use different data structure, so called "piece table", that has the advantage that it contains the change tracking information in the data structure itself, so it is trivial to traverse the changes. But, it is unusable for us because it would mean a complete Writer core rewrite. But - is there a possibility to upgrade/rewrite BigPtrArray so that it would contain the change tracking information in itself in a git-like fashion? ;-) That would allow us to do the changes incrementally - first upgrade the BigPtrArray without affecting the current functionality, and then do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Percona Toolkit is a set of tools that can help the DBA to perform tasks that are common but difficult to do manually. In this presentation, we will see how you can use some of the tools to solve typical problems:
- Which queries should I try to optimize to get better response times (pt-query-digest)?
- How can I efficiently purge data from my huge table without putting too much load on the server (pt-archiver)?
- Someone has accidentally written to a replica, how can I check which tables are affected and fix the problems without rebuilding the replica (pt-table-checksum &amp;amp; pt-table-sync)?
- How can I gather data for my performance problems that happen randomly and last only a few seconds (pt-stalk)?
- How can I run ALTER TABLE on my largest tables without downtime (pt-online-schema-change)?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The new MySQL 5.6 server is the most capable MySQL server ever developed. There are optimizer improvements, higher transactional throughput and lower latency for complex queries, NoSQL API with memcache, partitioning improvements, performance schema, and a range of replication features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present the top new features and go into more depth on replication, in terms of performance, scalability, high availability and agility – whether deployed on premise or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQL 5.6 leverages DevOps methodologies, providing a compelling feature set coupled with a comprehensive array of tooling. Together they reduce administrative overhead, providing flexibility to support rapidly evolving business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the third edition (2012) of High Performance MySQL, MHA usage is described as: "anyone other than Yoshinori who is using it in production, and we haven't used it ourselves." Little known to the authors, we've spent quite a lot of time working on MHA and figuring out its kinks. It has also been deployed in many a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn:
* how to get it running including files you'll have to customize
* about virtual IP failover
* integrating it with Pacemaker+Heartbeat+Corosync
* getting it working on the Solaris (10 &amp;amp; greater) environments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn from the experience in deploying and doing further engineering glue around the solution that is MHA.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Query runs slow, all threads are stacking for ages during peak time, application suddenly started run slower than before, ...
This is long and not complete list of performance issues you can experiment.
Are you curious why your MySQL installation does not work so fast as you wish to?
I will discuss methods which help to find why this happens and give you direction how to solve one or another problem.
I will prefer applications which come together with MySQL distribution as higher available, but don't stack with them and also discuss those great third-party tools which have not analogues.
You will learn how to choose a method best suited for particular problem and effectively use it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The MySQL RDBMS is traditionally tuned for OLTP workloads.  OLAP (analytic) workloads have traditionally been sub-optimal.  While it is true that Amazon EC2 and other cloud providers now provide large machines with SSD disks, these are still best for OLTP workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest EC2 server is limited to 64GB.  MySQL queries are single threaded. Perhaps spreading your data over eight 17.1GB servers might cost the same(or less) and perform significantly better. So, the question is, is one big server with lots of very fast storage the best option for analytic queries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce Shard-Query which can spread data over many
servers but treat the set as one big server.  Basic features will be discussed, but the focus is on performance, not how Shard-Query works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will compare the price/performance difference of OLAP queries on one ""Quadruple Extra Large High-IO"" server compared with eight ""Extra Large High Memory"" servers. While eight servers increase operational complexity, the performance improvement trade-off may very well be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shard-Query is an open source (bsd licensed) MPP query engine for MySQL:

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"MySQL Replication is a proven, simple and popular technology used to
fulfil many different requirements. Whether it is used as a simple
data store for a web shop, as an online backup tool or even as a mean
to extract reports without impacting the master, it is always regarded
as a very simple to setup and intuitive solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupled together with emergent tools and technologies, such as MySQL
utilities, MySQL proxy or even the binary log API, it opens a wide
range of possibilities for building complex and very useful solutions,
yet in a very simple way. For example, aggregating data from multiple
data centers, migrating data from/into MySQL servers and other
databases, using esoteric slaves as external full-text search engines
or even bridging into non-traditional and/or non-relational external
components to handle special requirements, these are all possibilities
that one can think of. Furthermore, MySQL 5.6 Replication shows up as
an enabler for many of these settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will showcase some advanced architectures combining MySQL
5.6 Replication and other tools."&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL Release 5.6 comes with several new query optimizer features that
may give improved performance for your queries. This presentation
looks at what kind of queries the different improvements apply to, and
we will focus on what you can do to get the most out of these new
features. The main topics will be improvements to how MySQL execute
disk-bound queries and advances in sub-query optimization. We will
also present results from test runs that show significant speed-up of
queries in MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, MySQL replication does not allow true multi-master topologies. Since it only supports one pipeline, the replication service is an all-or-nothing matter.
Using Tungsten Replicator, instead, not only you can define topologies with multiple masters easily, but you can also set filters and conditions for each pipeline.
With asynchronous replication, conflict resolution is hard to implement. But what you can do is conflict PREVENTION. If you want to define a system of records (each source is authorized to modify some of the data) in your multi-master topology, Tungsten offers you tools to achieve your goal easily.
This talk will show how you can define which sources can update each schema, and how Tungsten enforces the rules, according to your needs.
Demos are done using star and fan-in topologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL high-availability has usually been an exercise in tradeoffs: You can choose asynchronous replication and risk losing committed transactions on a failure. You can choose disk based (DRBD, SAN) replication for better durability but longer failover downtime. Galera replication has finally raised the bar for MySQL HA: You will learn how Galera brings synchronous, true multi-master and high performance (parallel slaves) replication to MySQL. You will learn how to start your first Galera cluster, and how to plan your architecture for maximum resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many applications are using MySQL’s built in replication to provide high availability with either manual or automated failover. One issue with this is that after failover, the former slave's buffer pool may be cold, and it becomes IO bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how we solved this issue and provided fast failover for a high traffic site using Percona Playback to replay the database traffic continuously on the failover hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is about the solutions we used there, and the measurements we performed to choose the appropriate solution for the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"During capacity planning, a frequent question which pops up is
""How much memory should I allocate for MySQL and for the system
in general?"".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, even though there are umpteen thumb rules about this on the Internet and in
books, often one notices/faces memory overrun or worse, an OOM;
when even  common recipes like vm.swappiness don't seem to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root to understanding this lies in discovering where and how&lt;br/&gt;
MySQL allocates the memory, the static (buffer pool, adaptive
hash index) and the variable (malloc/heaps/innodb data dictionary) components.&lt;br/&gt;
Correlation between mysql variables (max_connections, buffers aka
the 'bufferbloat' etc.) will also be addressed. The talk will
also delve over possible solutions like using memory cgroups,
avoiding OOMs with/without them and memory ballooning(virtualization). Lastly, a quick discussion on features planned and/or one would like to see, will be done.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Overview of the main features of the Ada language, with special emphasis on those features that make it especially attractive for free software development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ada is a feature-rich language, but what really makes Ada stand-out is that the features are nicely integrated towards serving the goals of software engineering. If you prefer to spend your time on designing elegant solutions rather than on low-level debugging, if you think that software should not fail, if you like to build programs from readily available components that you can trust, you should really consider Ada!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Android framework can be used to develop a part of the application (such as the user interface), but you can still benefit from Ada's reliability and advanced software engineering principles for the application logic (for example, control algorithms or image processing). The presentation will describe and demonstrate how easy it is to follow this development approach with Ada.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ada is one of very few programming languages that support multithreading as part of the language, as opposed to libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, the multithreading facilities use simple, high-level abstractions: tasks and protected objects, rather than low-level library calls. Ada allows beginners and younger programmers to write multithreading programs. If you come prepared with an Ada compiler on your laptop, you can learn by doing in this interactive, hands-on session, and unleash the full power of your multicore processor!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ada has a long record of being ahead of its time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ada 83 had templates and multithreading, that appeared in other mainstream languages nearly 15 years later. The latest incarnation of the language, officially standardized by ISO in December 2012, continues with this tradition. From programming by contract to multicore support, with sophisticated memory management schemes, and more, Ada is steaming ahead of the crowd!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of dimensional analysis is to verify dimension consistency within physical relations, preventing errors such as the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter because one module used metric units and another one imperial units. The presentation will describe how to perform compile-time checks to verify the dimensional consistency of physical computations, allowing the user to define his own system of units.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Alice is an Open Source PBX management application aimed at hosted reception facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Taming wild PBXes and meeting the fuzzy real-time requirements of human impatience are some of the challenges you face, when you build such systems. Using the Asterisk PBX, the Ada language, and AWS - the Ada Web Server, we take on the modern web armed with HTML5, Dart and WebSockets, to make Alice a reliable, commercial service for customers who consider answering the phone mission critical. I will present some examples of how Ada has made the construction of Alice - if not a walk in the park, then at least - reasonably easy and painless. During the presentation I plan to have a live example of Alice answering phones on a Raspberry Pi in front of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Hi-Lite project - combining testing and verification with GNATTest and GNATProve.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Verification activities mandated for critical software are essential to achieve the required level of confidence expected in life-critical or business-critical software. They are becoming increasingly costly as, over time, they require the development and maintenance of a large body of functional and robustness tests on larger and more complex applications. Formal program verification offers a way to reduce these costs while providing stronger guarantees than testing. Addressing verification activities with formal verification is supported by recent standards such as DO-178C for software development in avionics.
In the Hi-Lite project, we pursue the integration of formal verification with testing for projects developed in C or Ada. We present an open source verification framework based on the GNAT compiler for Ada, which allows combining the results of testing and formal verification of Ada programs. We benefit from the recent update of the Ada language, which includes richer expressions and contracts on functions. We show that this combination of verification techniques can be as strong as testing alone, while allowing the user to choose the most cost-effective technique for every function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;PostGIS 2.0 saw the light in 2012. This new major version of the GIS component of PostgreSQL comes with a lot of core changes and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raster in database is one of the long-awaited features present in version 2.0. Topology is also a complete set of features to deal with a new way of storing geometry information. Data management functions, geometry functions... A lot of new functions has been added to what was already available in the 1.5 series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But PostGIS development is far from being stalled, and a lot of work is ongoing to improve current features, have better performances, and add a whole range of new functionalities to the core set of PostGIS features. Among them, the work on 3D is a huge and complex task, raising new problems, but looks promising. Raster, topology are other areas where a lot of improvement is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the 2.0 novelties and what we could expect from next versions of PostGIS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Postgres has long been known as a stable database product that reliably stores your data. However, in recent years it has picked up many features, allowing it to become a much sexier database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll cover a whirlwind of Postgres features, which highlight why you should consider it for your next project. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datatypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using other languages within Postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensions including NoSQL inside your SQL database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessing your non-Postgres data (Redis, Oracle, MySQL) from within Postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Window Functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is for programmers that whish to integrate PostgreSQL in their applications or who maintain applications that use PostgreSQL as their primary database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas PostgreSQL claims to be "the most advanced open source database in the world", many client applications don't use advanced features, but rather a - maybe portable - subset of what PostgreSQL has to offer. Often we see applications that claim to be "database neutral" and that support many databases. These applications can then, of course, only use the least common denominator of the features of all databases. Once an application developer has decided to use PostgreSQL only, he is then ready to unveil the real power of PostgreSQL and to make use of advanced features and PostgreSQL specific functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Marc Balmer will show a number of tips, or rather programming and usage patterns, that allow you to create and maintain better PostgreSQL applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration and testing are becoming an integral part of modern software development. Both aid in maintaining as well as improving code and software quality, making them invaluable in every development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will outline the systems used for continuous integration and testing by the Unknown Horizons project. Unknown Horizons has been using Jenkins CI together with a growing set of custom tests extensively in the past year and has been improving the test suite constantly. Different kinds of tests will be demonstrated to show how to test the game on different abstraction levels: Unit Tests, UI Tests and AI Tests.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;THIS TALK HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO ILLNESS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle for Wesnoth is in the rare position of being an open source game project featuring many different translations for its huge amount of content. Currently Wesnoth features 54 translations of which 15 translations of the stable series are more than 90% complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session is about sharing the history behind this and factors which can help projects gain a stable internationalization community. The talk will focus on best practices which have shown themselves as working nicely for getting the translation community started as well as keeping translators happy. It might also show how the translation process is connected to the release cycle and what common problems for game translations are.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Gluon Project is an open framework for Game Creation and Distribution and encompasses the needs of all alike, from the Game Author to the Game Player. It strives to  provide a complete ecosystem for both the creation, distribution and feedback gathering in 2D Games.In the last couple of  years the project has seen  progress with leaps and bounds, it has been worked upon actively throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session aims at showcasing the progress of the project over the years, along with a working demo of the latest version of the application . The Gluon Creator and Player, crucial parts of The Gluon Project will be looked upon. Light would also be thrown on working of Gluon on the mobile platform .It also talks about the roadmap ahead, and garnering newer contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wesnoth's animation engine has evolved organically thoughout the years. Getting all the units to work together in an eye pleasing way is a tricky matter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will presents the wesnoth animation from a user point of view, i.e how to code an animation into wesnoth, but this will mainly be an excuse to present the specific challanges of writing a versatile animation description language in a turn based game where the user's attention is always focused on the animated unit.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many games separate game logic and engine to allow user modified game play, so called 'mods'. To make such mods portable across CPUs and operating systems Quake 3 allows to compile regular C code to a Quake3 specific byte code. The byte code is then translated to native instructions by the game when loading the mod to achieve near native performance. This talk explains how the virtual machine works and how it's possible that Quake 3 supports both native shared objects as well as byte code VM's.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Especially it is possible to continue discussions started before which could not be finished as part of talks. Other possible topics include but are not limited to:
„Is there a way and need to coordinate better among gaming projects?“
„Can we make it easier for possible contributors (not only coders!) to get involved?“
...&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Smalltalk and Unix communities are remarkable for their
pursuit of continuity, each with their own mantras. "Everything is an
object sending messages!" says one. "Everything is a file streaming
bytes!" says the other. In the space between, on today's net, one
might argue that everything is HTTP messages. Now that there is
widespread support for web services like DAV, any network-capable
device can appear to be a filesystem, while maintaining its own
organizational metaphors and behavior. I call these "active
filesystems". While they draw upon common concepts, their potential in
the contemporary computing envionment has greatly increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smalltalk has long had mechanisms for interacting with the rest
of the world. I'll present an active filesystem, Treaty, that enables
the world to interact with Smalltalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is dedicated to the memory of Andreas Raab.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things in software engineering we take for granted these days are rooted in Smalltalk.
But most people do not program in Smalltalk. Do you wonder if there
are more pieces of brilliance in Smalltalk waiting to be picked up by
the general computing community? Come and experience yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runs 2.5 hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll work with you through an exercise showing Seaside
and other little known treasures, fully exploiting the 'objects-all-the-way'
attitude visible in the Pharo open source Smalltalk environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring your laptop to pair through the exercises. Take home a web application, deployed on your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Firefox OS has already altered many people's perceptions of what is    possible through standard technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and   Javascript.  As Firefox OS is a perception-altering, market-changing   project, we  believe every element should be preception-altering,   including the  technology behind the way we localize it. L20n is   paradigm-shattering,  next generation localization technology which  will  only add to Firefox  OS's ability to stand out as a truly  innovative  project. L20n allows  localizers reach a higher level of  free linguistic  expression,  unencumbered by an application's logic.  Join us to see how  l20n will  change localization and how it adds to  Firefox OS's mission  to push the  boundaries of what's possible in open  source.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Firefox's rendering architecture has changed quite a bit in the past  few years. Web content is becoming more and more complex, while we still  serve it on very low end devices such as mobile platforms where  expectations are very high. Gecko's compositing system moved to an  asynchronous architecture allowing us to keep some parts of the user  experience perfectly smooth even when the the browser is busy processing  web content such as JS. Among the elements that benefit from this:  panning, zooming, CSS animations and transitions, video playback.
This  talk will give an overview of this asynchronous architecture, How it  impacts user experience and what we want to achieve in this area in the  future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A   common complaint from contributors when they first approach the    Mozilla codebase is that it is very different from web development or    other JS environments, and the large and complex set of APIs available    have a steep learning curve. Recently the Jetpack team has been  focusing  its efforts on integrating  the Add-on SDK APIs into Firefox.  This has  benefits for both Firefox and  add-on developers:
-    Add-on developers using the SDK  will no longer need to re-pack  their   add-ons to benefit from bug fixes, as the SDK APIs will be  included  in  Firefox builds.
-   The Add-on SDK APIs will become available for all add-on  developers,   without the need to use the SDK's packaging infrastructure.
-   New Firefox features can be implemented using de-facto standard    CommonJS modules, allowing for modular, re-usable and easily testable    code
-   CommonJS module format enables use of many modules available in node's   npm (Over 15300 packages have already being  published on https://npmjs.org/)&lt;br/&gt;
Also learn about how some teams at Mozilla already use Jetpack APIs in Firefox core!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CSS    saw a lot of changes in 2012. With the maturation of several    specification, today Web developpers need less prefixes and can use  new   layouts. A review of :
1) what's new in the standard and when devs will be able to use it,
2) what's new in Gecko
3) what's coming up in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In our efforts to build Firefox OS and Firefox for Android as  solutions  for Mobile World we don't have any control of the web content  available  out there. We can build up a better user experience but the  products  will still be afffected by the lack of standards. As stock  browsers  (both iPhone and Android) are build upon Webkit rendering  engine. other  browsers (including Firefox for Android) will experience  top sites  returning desktop content, inferior mobile sites, or sites   with broken  layout and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Our   motto is "Mobilize Mozilla" and our goal is to change the web for    another  time in history. Firefox for Android and Firefox OS, are the    new  bleeding edge products for the new mobile web.
Firefox    OS simulator, Responsive design and a lot of new cool tools are  the    development tools that every mobile web developer must use.
Thought this presentation I aim to help web developers to build and debug their web applications easy and fast.
The web is the platform and the Firefox OS is key for creating a successful mobile web platform.
That's    why I am willing to present Firefox OS emulator, how to run web    applications in it and especially how to debug them. Last but not least   I  am willing to present how you can debug Firefox OS (Gaia) which is   HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript after all.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As the Firefox OS project started, one of the first main concerns was   to handle internationalization and localization on the client-side. The   webL10n library allows to use the *.properties format used in most   Mozilla and Java-based projects in any web page, with a few extensions   to implement L20n concepts without breaking the forward compatibility.   Find out how easy it can be for developers to internationalize an   application, and how localizers can be empowered to handle complex   grammatical situations easily (e.g. pluralization rules).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At   Mozilla we are supporting over 400+ million users in 80+ languages  with  a tiny team of full time employees. That is only made possible by  the  help of hundreds of volunteer contributors whose efforts are all   channeled through Kitsune, our own support software developed from   scratch to be the best possible support platform on the web.
In   this talk we'll cover on one hand the main features of the platform,   how we are using it to support so many users, and what sets it apart   from many other similar tools on the web. On the other hand we'll peak   behind the curtain and give an overview of the software stack used for   Kitsune. We'll share our development workflow from choosing a bug all   the way to deploying and show how interested developers can get started   using and contributing to Kitsune.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the main challenges facing the Free Software
Foundation's Licensing and Compliance lab in 2013, and will invite
discussion of the FSF's work and policies in this area. We'll explore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright assignment: Some high-profile GNU maintainers have
recently criticized the FSF's copyright assignment policy and
system. What are these criticisms, what does the FSF intend to do
about them, and what's the point of its assignment process to begin
with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPL adoption: Last year here, in "Is copyleft being framed?", I put
numbers supposedly showing declining GPL adoption in perspective,
showing problems with the data, questioning the conclusions drawn
from the data, and presenting different data leading to the opposite
conclusions. We'll look at the questions that were raised since then
about my data, and at some new data that's been made available, and
draw new conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Stores: When Apple's App Store launched, the FSF concluded that
its terms were incompatible with the GPL -- and with any kind of
strong copyleft. Since then, we have several new App Stores; most
notably from Google and Microsoft. Are the Apple terms still
incompatible with the GPL? Are the other stores any better? Are
these stores undermining GPL adoption, and should copyleft relax its
standards in order to get free software to this audience, or should
it stand its ground?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <track>Legal issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Much of the legal talk about licences centres around issues
of enforceability, compatability and transferability. Before licences
were tested in court, enforcement was carried out in a quasi-legal way
and “bargaining in the shadow of the law” was the norm. Later, some
cases came to court across a number of jurisdictions and a variety of
FLOSS licences have been upheld, albeit in lower courts. This does not
really set any legal precedent but it has brought a little
predictability to the area. The debate about the legality of these
licences is still current, nonetheless and new licences are being
drafted, despite a plethora already in existence. Seen in a
socio-legal and historical context, such agreements emerge when the
law does not provide for the type of arrangement envisaged but there
comes a point at which the legislature needs to respond to provide
legal certainty which a licence or contract may not. This talk
explores two possible legal evolutions which would ensure the legality
of FLOSS licences: either the enactment of an international or
regional convention along the lines of the Free Software Act
http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/issue4/FS-Act.asp or else an
agreement between licensor and licensee along private international
law principles (choice of law clauses) which can then be enshrined by
the courts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Launched as a project in July 2012, copyleft-next is an effort to
publicly develop a new, simple, easily-understandable and legally
sound GPL-like license. copyleft-next began as a mere modification of
GPLv3, but it quickly evolved into a text that is radically different
from the GPL in structure and style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the substance of the current copyleft-next
draft, the nature of the drafting process, and the larger issue of why
such a project is worthwhile. I will describe the rationale for
significant features of the copyleft-next license text, including its
notable departures from GPLv2 and GPLv3. I will also explain how and
why the project has adopted some of the standard methodology of public
free software project development, including the use of a public git
repository and a publicly-archived mailing list, a major change
from earlier free software-related legal drafting efforts. The project
is also noteworthy for its invention of the "Harvey Birdman Rule",
which has two aims: to maximize transparency by discouraging
undisclosed private negotiations over license drafting, and to limit
the undue influence of interest groups far removed from the concerns
of individual free software developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free software runs most of the smartphones in the world, but it's
difficult to tell. Between network carriers who want to charge for everything they can and
handset manufacturers who want differentiate their products as much as
possible from their competitors', nobody is eager to give users control over their
phones. In the U.S., the Digital Millennium Copyright Act prevents users from
circumventing the access controls increasingly used to lock phones down.
In this talk, a free software lawyer will discuss the legal and practical
obstacles to free mobile operating systems and about SFLC's effort to get the Copyright
Office to recognize a DMCA exception allowing users to install free
software on mobile phones. (Spoiler alert: it didn't work.)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

procurement notices in Finland, searching of violations of the
procurement law, specifically cases where the procurement notices ask
for a specific brand or product, thus discriminating free competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common example would be a government or municipality office
seeking to renew their Microsoft licences, and therefore release a
call for tenders for Microsoft licenses, effectively restricting
tenderers to Microsoft resellers, discriminating any other operating
system vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing calls for tenders that restrict the offering to a specific
brand or product is illegal in all of the EU countries. With these
actions FSFE seeks to develop an EU-wide procurement monitoring
effort, that will eventually lead to free competition, and as Free
Software is superior in most cases, it will lead to significant
increase in Free Software usage in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk the team coordinator Otto Kekäläinen will tell about the
efforts motivations, the latest news about how the effort is going on
and what impact it has had. PR about the effort:

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Baboon can helps you ! It's a lightweight daemon that detects merge conflicts before they actually happen. In fact, it detects them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you waste your time in resolving merge conflicts with your favorite source code manager ? Do you want to get rid of "Merge Hells" ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baboon can helps you ! It's a lightweight daemon that detects merge conflicts before they actually happen. In fact, it detects them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as Baboon is installed and configured (a matter of seconds, honest, a minute top) on your project's contributors computers, it starts its job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baboon syncs in real time your files (well, everytime you save one) with the ones of your co-workers on a central server and simulates a merge of the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a conflict is detected, every contributor receives an alert to warn them that eventually, a conflict will occur (Baboon even tells you on which file it will happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to blame the culprit ! (Yeah, Baboon also tells you who originated the conflict)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's lucky anyway. At this point, the merge conflict is super easy to solve, it's small. Remember, you're warned in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;datastore is a simple unified key-value store api (think sqlalchemy for kv-stores). It began as a layer of abstraction to ease the use of various kv-stores, but incredible properties fell out of the abstraction:
(1) one can seamlessly swap storage architectures without changing application code. (2) ANY storage system can be plugged into your application (e.g. git). (3) caching, sharding, version control, and other complicated access patterns are implemented entirely as modules, not application code!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us are writing python during our days or nights and we're still discovering new and impressive ways of using
the language quite often. This talk is a attempt to gather together interesting patterns I've seen in the code I'm reading
or writing since I'm doing python, that are not well-known in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you knew that descriptors are the mechanism that python uses internally to define its methods and classes,
combined with metaclasses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I learned python a bunch of years ago, each time I come across a python hacker
I try to spend some time with them asking the same question: "what was the last thing you found impressive with python".
(Note how I'm pretty sure people found some incredible value in python itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk gather all of these together. You'll see a lot of python code in this presentation, and me trying
to explain to you what this is doing, and why it's impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you also have some interesting thoughts or python tips to share, bring them with you, they're welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to propose tips related to the following stdlib parts:
  working with iterables using itertools
  using the AST to rewrite some statements (like this is done for assert by some testing frameworks)
  A bunch of comprehensive examples to explain what python is doing behind the scenes with descriptors
  How to use function annotations to typecheck arguments
  How is it possible to do pattern matching with python
  How metaclasses can be used to provide a simple plugin mechanism
  How django / sqla / others use metaclasses to ease the declaration of models etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a complete list of what I intend to propose, the talk is still being written :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This talk could also had been named "an advanced tour of the python standard library")&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the C10K problem, event loops have been used together with IO multiplexors to solve IO scalability issues. There are different event loops which can be used in Python, some high level ones like Twisted or Tornado, and some low level ones like pyev or pyuv, or you can even roll your own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the author of pyuv I'll go through the inners of the libuv low level event loop and show how it can be used to build a higher level one, that is, how to use it with Twisted, Tornado and even Gevent.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Python bytecode is inefficient: the compiler generates useless and redundant instructions, dead code and only implement basic optimizations. We can do better! I will present two projects trying to generate better bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;astoptimizer optimizes the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a Python program. It tries to do as much work as possible at compile time. It is able to call builtin functions with immutables arguments, simplifies expressions, optimizes loops, iterators and generators, fold constants and removes dead code.
https://bitbucket.org/haypo/astoptimizer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;registervm is a fork of Python 3.4 rewriting its evaluation loop to support new instructions using registers instead of a stack. Bytecode using registers is shorter (less instruction) and using registers allows new optimizations. For example, it is much easier to move constants out of loops. registervm removes useless instructions like LOAD&lt;em&gt;NAME following STORE&lt;/em&gt;NAME, and useless jumps. Duplicated constant loads are also removed.

greenlets or generators to handle corountines and optionnaly use pyuv
to manage a non blocking IO poll server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A demo showing how ls IO in the Raspberry Pi are handled by the coroutines
allowing each to be messaged individually using channels will be done.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wine for Users is intended to introduce non Wine-developer users to the Wine Project, including what Wine is, how to use it, and how users can get involved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wine is designed to run Windows applications on  Linux, Mac OSX, &amp;amp; BSD. Users play a vital role in testing thousands of Windows apps and games in Wine and reporting successes as well as problems.  This session will provide a brief intro to how Wine works and its limitations, how to use it, basic troubleshooting steps, and ways in which non-developer users can contribute to the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wine now has the ability to use a Windows build of Mono to run .NET Applications. This talk will give an introduction to Mono development, with a focus on improving Wine's compatibility with .NET applications designed for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting with version 1.5.6, Wine includes a Mono package called Wine Mono, which it uses as a free replacement for the Microsoft .NET runtime. This solution can theoretically run .NET applications designed for Windows without modification, but in practice it does not work for the majority of real .NET applications. I do not believe that enough people are working on this solution to make a noticeable difference to Wine's compatibility in the next few years. I believe this is because the Microsoft .NET runtime can be installed in Wine and has better compatibility, and because Wine developers do not know how to work on Mono. Although .NET enables better compatibility in the short term, it leaves us dependent on Microsoft and is not useful for developers who wish to port their software from Windows but have a dependency on .NET and on libraries that cannot be ported to a non-Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an introduction to Wine Mono development. The talk will not assume prior knowledge of development for Wine, Windows, .NET, or Mono, but it will assume some general knowledge of object-oriented programming and some experience using Wine, or at least a basic understanding of what Wine does. The following topics will be discussed:
 * How to build Wine Mono from source.
 * How to modify the Wine Mono source code and ensure that Wine uses those modifications.
 * How to use Mono's tracing feature to debug .NET applications running in Wine.
 * How to submit changes to the appropriate upstream project (usually Mono or Wine Mono).
 * How to add test cases to Mono and run them in Wine or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>WineTestBot: A Wine gatekeeper and test farm for Wine developers</subtitle>
        <track>Wine Project</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The time to fix bugs is before they enter the code base. The WineTestBot is Wine's attempt at following this maxim by providing a test farm so Wine developers can test their patches early and often and so bad patches are blocked before they are committed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wine 'conformance tests' are the means by which Wine developers  explore and document the behavior of the Windows API. The trouble is they typically have access to at most one Windows version making it impossible to distinguish between quirks in that version and behavior Windows applications may rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WineTestBot is meant to not only solve that issue but also act as a filter to weed out bad patches before they get committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was initially developed as a VMware-based Windows test farm to solve that issue. It was then extended to test all conformance test patches to weed out the bad ones before they get committed. Now the challenges are to migrate it to a fully open-source architecture; extend it to validate all Wine patches and thus to non-Windows platforms; and to also run the tests on real hardware for the 3D and sound tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will first provide a quick refresher on the conformance tests. Then it will present the architecture of the WineTestBot, how it compares to other testing frameworks, the implications of extending it to all Wine patches, and to testing on real hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Go is a new systems programming language with a focus on concurrency and expressiveness. The Go programming language recently gained support for running on NetBSD on the i386 (386) and x86_64 (amd64) architectures. This support will be part of the upcoming Go 1.1 release. (FreeBSD had already been supported in the Go 1 release).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an introduction to Go and presents some of its benefits for systems and network server programming. It will then go further into detail regarding its implementation on NetBSD from the programmer's and from the admin's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Xen paravirtualized guests have been around for a long time, but during that period only one BSD OS was able to fully support them, that is NetBSD. With the arrival of hardware extensions to help virtualization, the Xen community has started to develop a new kind of paravirtualized guest that make use of hardware extensions to provide better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new type of paravirtualized guest, called PVH, makes use of hardware-assisted pagetable virtualization to get rid of one of the most difficult parts to implement when porting a new Operating System to Xen, the paravirtualized MMU. This, apart from the obvious benefit of having a performance boost, also benefits Operating System that don't have a virtualization solution, with the aid of hardware extensions, the required code changes to port a new OS to Xen are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the features of the new paravirtualization mode, and how it can simplify the port of new Operating Systems to Xen.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Towards the very end of 2011, new versions of the C and C++ standards were released. The last time this happened was 1999 for C and 2003 for C++, so this is far from a regular occurrence. Much of the discussion of the support has focussed on the compiler, but both C and C++ have a large standard library. The C standard library is a core part of any UNIX system - the public system call interface is specified in terms of functions in this library - and so the task of bringing this support to users falls to a mixture of libc, the compiler, and a few other supporting pieces of code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at the current status of support for these new standards in FreeBSD, the difficulties of implementing some parts, how they overcome, and the remaining challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A tale of sadness and a tale of joy: the tale of invokedynamic use in
JRuby and a few other projects since the first prototypes dropped in
2008. I started experimenting with invokedynamic in JRuby in version
1.1.5, early in the JSR-292 process, and kept up with changes as they
arrived. Today, JRuby utilizes invokedynamic for several aspects of
the Ruby language, and we're finding more ways to use it every day.
I'll talk about where we've been and where we're going...what works
and what doesn't...and how to understand everything happening under
the covers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The latest specification of the JVM (JVMS 7) introduced a new instruction: invokedynamic designed by the JSR 292 Expert Group
to make easier the implementation of dynamic typed languages like Python, Ruby, SmallTalk... on top of the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This JSR also provides a new Java package java.lang.invoke that exposes Virtual Machine internal mechanisms
through a standardized API allowing dynamic language runtimes to be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current version of Dalvik, the virtual machine of Android, is compatible with the Java specification 6 thus doesn't provide the invokedynamic instruction.
That's why most of the developers of dynamic languages that support Android provide two runtimes,
one compatible with the JVMS 6 and an other compatible with the JVMS 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One goal of my thesis is to provide a full implementaion of the JSR 292 on Dalvik.
But Android is a constrained environment that make most of the tricks used by the desktop/server VMs
like Hotspot (Oracle JVM) and J9 (IBM JVM) either inefficient or harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an introduction explaining how invokedynamic works and how it is used to optimize dynamic languages.
I will present some tricks used by Hotspot to implement invokedynamic,
why some of them can not be used by Dalvik and I will finish with some ideas of implementations on Dalvik.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lambda expressions and default methods are new and significant language features that will be arriving in JDK8. Application of those new language features enables new and significant library enhancements in JDK8. This talk will introduce the new language and major library enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant library enhancement will be the introduction of a new collections API. Without lambda expressions and default methods such an API would not be feasible. This new collections API is designed to make it easier to process data compared to the external iteration approach as currently required using the existing Collections API. Further more, by internally using the Fork/Join framework added in JDK7 the new API provides an unobtrusive and simple way for the developer to leverage parallel execution and fully utilize modern multicore systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this talk developers should have a good understanding of the new features, know how to obtain the OpenJDK Lambda implementation, try out those features, and provide valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year, we shared with the Free Java Devroom and the global OSS community our vision for a new open source monitoring and instrumentation tool for anyone running an open Java stack, along with our fledgeling implementation.  Since then, we've been hard at work making this vision a reality.  Our project has undergone various transformations, including becoming modular not just in terms of deployment but also from a source code perspective with the help of OSGi, a complete overhaul of the API for extending Thermostat, and an amazing visual makeover - attendees from last year may have trouble recognizing it on sight.  Along the way we've also added new, compelling features such as detailed thread monitoring, heap dump and analysis, an Eclipse plugin interface, and more functionality available from the command line.  Of course, we also had a lot of fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our talk, we will describe the current state of Thermostat, give a demo of what you can do out of the box, and build a toy plugin on the spot so that attendees can see how easy it is to add custom instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Java Community Process (JCP) program has made significant changes over the last 12-18 month period in order to increase community participation in the development of Java Specification Requests (JSR) and to enable greater transparency for the community into the JSR expert groups.  Reforms to the JCP through JCP.Next as well as the creation of the Adopt-a-JSR program have enabled this involvement from the community that is vital to the success of Java. The free and open source community now have greater opportunities for contributions and feedback . We will discuss the current state of the nation and ask for feedback and suggestions for greater participation moving forward through the ongoing JCP.Next effort, specifically JSR 358, A major revision to the Java Community Process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Presenting JogAmp, a media and processing library for mobile and desktop devices
on top of Java. We will introduce you to the platform agnostic open-source API,
which allows you to use JOAL/OpenAL, JOGL /OpenGL and JOCL/OpenCL across devices.
A demonstration on multiple devices including a PC will conclude this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will present JogAmp, a media and processing library for mobile and
desktop devices on top of Java. JogAmp's objectives are to provide platform agnostic
modules to application developers, allowing them seamless access to the OpenAL, OpenGL
and OpenCL APIs. JogAmp allows writing applications suitable for desktop machines (Linux,
Windows, OSX, Solaris) as well as for embedded and mobile devices (Linux, Android,
Windows). Support for more platform can be easily achieved and performed by ourselves or
user base, possible due to the open-source nature of the project. We will outline the
architecture and describe the simplicity of it's usage with code samples.
We will show you live demonstration of demos running on PC and mobile devices, including Phones and Tablets running on Linux and Android. The demos will utilize the OpenGL ES2 compatibility profile, video decoding APIs and device specifics.
JogAmp is available at http://jogamp.org&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation focuses on the Lambda architecture, which combines multiple technologies to be able to process vast amounts of data, while still being able to react timely and report near real-time statistics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of data sources and growing user bases, the amount of data generated requires new ways for storage and processing. Hadoop opened new possibilities, yet it falls short of instant delivery. Adding stream processing using Twitter's Storm, can overcome this delay and bridge the gap to real-time aggregation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Batch layer all master data is kept and is immutable. Once the base data is stored a recurring process will index the data. This process reads all master data, parses it and will create new views out of it. The new views will replace all previously created views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Speed layer data is stored not yet absorbed in the Batch layer. Hours of data instead of years of data. Once the data is indexed in the Batch layer the data can discarded in the Speed layer.
The Query Service merges the data from the Speed and Batch layers.&lt;/p&gt;
