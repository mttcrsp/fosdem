        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;systemd is a system and service manager for Linux and is at the core of most of today's big distributions. In this presentation I'd like to explain where systemd stands in 2016, and where we want to take it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please join me if you are interested in the Linux platform from a developer, user, administrator PoV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cockpit is the new system admin UI for Linux. It's a default part of Fedora, and available in other distros as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cockpit turns a Linux server into something discoverable and usable. All while being zero-footprint: It goes away when not in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll how how Cockpit works: It's an actual linux user session that you drive through your browser, running with user privileges, and accesses to the native system APIs and tools. Cockpit reacts instantly to server changes made by other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll also show you how to contribute, and talk about what you'll see next in Cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Please note that the presenter of this talk changed after the booklet went to press.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Enterprise environment means a lot of integration to work together. Single sign-on, VPNs, access controls, boring user experience, multiple third-party applications which may not be playing well with each other. FreeIPA is a project providing an integrated and secure setup of complete free software stack that makes up a typical enterprise environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As remote work spreads wider, 'an enterprise' becomes a home environment as well: more applications are moved to cloud hosting, both on premises and at third parties' clouds, and more people have to balance their home and work identities and data at the same time. This talk will explain our work together with GNOME community to produce a desktop environment friendly to enterprise and how it makes our home environments more secure without compromising on usability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RIPE Atlas is a global network of probes that measure Internet connectivity and reachability. More then 9000 hardware probes are hosted by the community of volunteers. Supported measurements are ping, traceroute6, DNS, NTP, and TLS. All the probes perform constant measurements towards root name servers, and the users are able to start their own measurements from up to 500 probes at the time, to the target of their own choice. All the results of performed measurements are publicly available as open data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RIPE Atlas is a global network of probes that measure Internet connectivity and reachability. More then 9000 hardware probes are hosted by the community of volunteers. Supported measurements are ping, traceroute6, DNS, NTP, and TLS. All the probes perform constant measurements towards root name servers, and the users are able to start their own measurements from up to 500 probes at the time, to the target of their own choice. All the results of performed measurements are publicly available as open data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the web interface &amp;amp; the API calls for starting your own measurements, and for downloading results, there is now CLI toolset. This open-source toolset is the newest addition to the large collection of tools written by RIPE NCC developers &amp;amp; the community of volunteers, individually or during two hackathon runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals with this presentation are: to encourage FOSDEM participants to contribute to the free &amp;amp; open source code related to RIPE Atlas &amp;amp; port the toolset to Linux/BSD distributions; to use the existing data, start their own measurements, and to share results by writing papers &amp;amp; giving presentations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What Do Code Reviews at Microsoft and in Open Source Projects Have in Common?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Enterprise</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Code review is the manual assessment of source code by human reviewers. It is widely recommended practice in software engineering and it is widely adopted both in industrial settings and in open source projects.
What can we learn if we compare code review in OSS projects and at Microsoft? In this talk, I will present and compare the results of two studies about code review: One conducted at Microsoft and one conducted in open source settings. We learn that--despite the differences in environments, incentives, languages, and used tools--code review at Microsoft and in the analyzed open source projects have one common trait: The outcome. Unfortunately, this outcome does not match the main reasons why developers say they do code reviews: Finding defects. I will discuss why this happens and what we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In summer 2013, we investigated expectations, outcomes, and challenges of code review at Microsoft. I conducted face-to-face interviews with several professional developers, performed a deep analysis of the code review data across many products at Microsoft (e.g., Excel and XBox), and administered a company-wide survey answered by more than  1'000 Microsoft developers and managers. We found that outcomes clearly do not match the expectations from various angles and across all product groups. The study was published at the International Conference on Software Engineering in 2013 (see attached file).
After this, we investigated the outcomes of code review in two active open source projects with several years of development (ConQAT and GROMACS). We found a staggering similarity in the outcomes of code review at Microsoft, despite the great differences in the environments in which code review are conducted and the incentives. The study was published at the Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories in 2014 (see attached file).
In this talk, I will present the details of these studies, their results, and the motivation we gave to this difference between code review expectations and outcomes, and how I am trying to make code review work as expected with my research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;H2O: An Open-Source Platform for Machine Learning and Big Data/Big Math.  H2O is clustering: from just your laptop to 100's of nodes, you get a Single System Image; allowing easy aggregation of all the memory and all the cores, and a simple coding style that scales wide at in-memory speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a technical talk on the insides of H2O, specifically focusing on the Single-System-Image aspect: how we write single-threaded code, and have H2O auto-parallelize and auto-scale-out to 100's of nodes and 1000's of cores.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;H2O: An Open-Source Platform for Machine Learning and Big Data/Big Math.  H2O is clustering: from just your laptop to 100's of nodes, you get a Single System Image; allowing easy aggregation of all the memory and all the cores, and a simple coding style that scales wide at in-memory speeds. H2O is easily 1000x faster than disk based clustering solutions, and often 10x faster than best-of-breed alternative in-memory solutions.  H2O is Big Data: we ingest a wide variety of formats, in parallel and distributed across the cluster, and store the data column-compressed - often exceeding 2x to 4x gzip-on-disk.  H2O is Big Math: we do scale-out math at memory-bandwidth speeds (on compressed data!), making terabyte-scale munging an interactive experience.  H2O is Machine Learning: On this Big Data, Big Math platform we have Best-of-Breed implementations of effective and popular Machine Learning algorithms: e.g. Deep Learning (Neural Nets), GBM, Random Forest, GLM, K-means, PCA, Naive Bayes, and more... with all the features you need to do real data science built-in.  Finally H2O interacts directly with Python, R, Scala, Spark, REST/JSON, and a JS-based web browser - making it the most interconnected Machine Learning platform out there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gluster provides Software Defined Storage for the cloud, and is gaining new functionalities every couple of months. New features make it possible to deploy the cloud storage solution for an increasing number of use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Gluster project tries to release a major version every six months. Each version introduces many new features. Use-cases that were not a good fit for Gluster, are getting the improvements so that using Gluster can be considered again. Recently added features include BitRot detection, NFS-Ganesha integration for high-availability NFS access, improved options to prevent split-brain situations and many more. Later in 2016 a major feature release is planned, this will include support for New Style Replication, Distributed Hash Translator v2 and a complete rewrite of the main GlusterD management daemon to make it more scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, an introduction into Gluster basics will be given so that the attendees have a good understanding of the technology. With the basic understanding of Gluster, the explanation of the recent and future features will become very understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Rearchitecting Linux I/O towards Petascale Storage</title>
        <subtitle>Treat Linux like a microkernel and push towards a simpler distributed user-space storage architecture.</subtitle>
        <track>Enterprise</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux kernel contains roughly 71 filesystems and a good portion of them exists solely to support legacy systems. User space storage is easier to implement, maintain and scale. Instead of resisting user space implementations of iSCSI, NFS and distributed filesystems, Linux kernel developers should embrace and standardize on FUSE and DPDK/SPDK like I/O architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Other than the root filesystems and its supporting code, there is little to no reason for the rest of the storage code base to remain inside the kernel. From NTFS, NFS-Ganesha to GlusterFS, it has been clearly demonstrated that user-space storage systems work well. Recent open source storage projects moved further apart from the kernel community and adopted Python (OpenStack Swift), Java (Hadoop HDFS) and Golang (Minio) languages. POSIX is not only irrelevant, but an impediment to modern distributed storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux as a stand-alone operating system does not help much when it comes to distributed authentication, high-availability (HA) and fault-tolerance.  Most of the modern applications entirely run as non-root user with all its dependencies managed within its home directory.  Authentication is based on SSL/TLS and certificates over HTTP. HA is achieved through centralized discovery and consensus algorithms through Zookeeper (Java), Doozer (Go), Consul (Go), etcd (Go) like projects for high-availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Linux has quietly grown as a popular microkernel of choice under the name of hypervisors and linux-container-hosts. It is time to admit and embrace the change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Digital hardware design, or “HDL programming,” is growing in popularity with the widespread availability of FPGA platforms. Yet, the ecosystem around it needs some work. Tooling, the availability of code, licensing and a scattered community make it hard to get started. In this talk, we'll look at the situation today, and where things are going. As newcomer you'll leave the talk with all you need to know to start an FPGA design. And as experienced developer you will get an update on what's going on around you. Because digital hardware design doesn't need to be hard.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Build your own processor! Improve your graphics chip! Sounds far fetched? Actually, it does not need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the free software world, we have come to enjoy an ecosystem of excellent code to build on, production-quality libraries, reliable tools, and a healthy and helpful community. Software development has become available to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started in digital hardware design, a.k.a. “writing code that describes how a chip works”, is not  as easy yet. Trouble already starts with the question “What do you want to do with your design?” Producing a chip still is rather expensive, and looking at the product of long nights of work in slow-motion simulations it not terribly rewarding. Here FPGAs, “reprogrammable chips,” have come to rescue. With eval boards starting at under $100 and Intel incorporating FPGAs into their processors, hardware access has become easier. With this problem out of the way, we can now focus on the ecosystem of free and open source digital hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me for a look at code, tools, licensing, and the community. What's already there? What can we take from the software world? And where is all this going? All to answer the ultimate question: when will we be able to create our own processor?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>GNU Radio for Exploring Signals</title>
        <subtitle>Talk Hard: A technical, historical, political, and cultural look at FM</subtitle>
        <track>Hardware</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In GNU Radio, we often find ourselves going to the FM broadcast stations as a first introduction to radio, software radio, and signal processing. FM broadcast is nearly ubiquitous and has a narrow enough bandwidth that very inexpensive hardware all over the world can work with it. It also has an interesting enough structure that allows us to go from simple to more complicated GNU Radio applications for studying all sorts of ways in which we can process it as a signal.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FM broadcasting is present almost anywhere in the world, and its structure makes it an interesting challenge and good learning exercise for developing GNU Radio applications. Likewise, almost any software radio RF front end is capable of processing FM: from the very cheap RTL-SDR dongles to the more expensive USRPs. In this talk, I will introduce FM from its historical roots and walk through why it is a technologically important development as I build more complicated GNU Radio applications to explore the FM waveform. As a broadcast medium, FM has also played an important political, social, and cultural role in the last century. Aside from the technical development of how to process FM signals, I will use this lecture as an introduction to regulatory agencies and band planning. Part of this will involve the development, problems, and importance of FM pirate radio. The lecture will involve a demonstration of embedded GNU Radio applications that will showcase the FM capture effect by imitating a (very) low power radio station.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Vulkan in Open-Source</title>
        <subtitle>A discussion of the new Vulkan graphics API and its impact on Open-source software</subtitle>
        <track>Hardware</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Vulkan is the new next-generation graphics API from Khronos that is meant to replace OpenGL for many high-performance graphics applications.  The talk will focus on three main topics: The Vulkan API itself, the impact of of the Vulkan API on open-source software including both open-source applications and running closed-source applications on open-source operating systems, and support of Vulkan APIs in open-source drivers on Intel platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The OpenGL API has been the standard for 3-D graphics on Linux and MacOS for the long as 3-D has existed on those platforms.  (On Windows, the standard is usally DirectX, although OpenGL is also available.)  In the last couple of years, there has been a substantial push for low-level and low-overhead API's similar to what game consoles provide.  In response to thise, multiple new APIs have emerged: Mantle, DirectX 12, Metal, and now Vulkan.  This talk will focus on Vulkan, as it aims to be the new cross-platform industry standard and the one that will be the most available for Open-source platforms and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 24 years since OpenGL was first released, a lot has changed in the world of graphics hardware and many of the concepts in OpenGL no longer map well to modern hardware and software.  One such mismatch is that OpenGL uses a state machine model with a thread-local implicit context.  While this wasn't a problem at the time, the prevalence of multi-threaded programming to take advantage of multi-core processors has made this a substantial pain-point when working with OpenGL.  Vulkan and other next-gen APIs use a more object-oriented model where multi-threading hazards are more explicit.  There are many other examples of where OpenGL no longer matches modern graphics hardware or programming paradigms.  Vulkan seeks to solve a lot of these problems while also providing substantially lower CPU overhead and the latest in modern graphics features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vulkan API also provides substantial opportunity to the free software community.  Because there is so much industry momentum behind Vulkan, there will probably be substantial support from both Hardware and Software vendors.  This means that we may see more availability of games and other high-performance graphics applications on Linux.  It also means that free software can now get the benefits of more modern graphics APIs.  Not only should Vulkan be a more performant API, but it should also be easier to integrate into toolkits such as GTK and Qt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Libreboot - free software BIOS replacement (boot firmware), based on coreboot, for laptops and servers, and x86 (Intel/AMD) and ARM hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Libreboot is a free software BIOS replacement (boot firmware), based on coreboot, for Intel, AMD and ARM based systems. Backed by the Free Software Foundation, the aim of the Libreboot project is to provide individuals and companies with an escape from proprietary firmware in their computing. Libreboot is also being reviewed for entry as an official component of the GNU system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boot firmware is the low-level software that runs when you turn your computer on, which initializes the hardware and starts a bootloader for your operating system. Libreboot currently supports laptops and servers, on x86 (Intel and AMD) and ARM (Rockchip RK3288), with more hardware support on the horizon. The purpose of this talk is to describe the history of the project, why it started, why it's important, where it's going and, most importantly, to tell people how they can get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leah also runs the Minifree (formerly Gluglug), a company that sells computers with libreboot and Trisquel GNU/Linux pre-installed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rspamd - fast opensource spam filter</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rspamd is fast open source (BSD licensed) spam filtering system that uses score system to filter messages. In this presentation, I will speak about the internal architecture, performance optimizations, security issues, algorithms used and general spam filtering problems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will describe rspamd - a fast spam filtering system used by many companies that process large volumes of e-mail. I'll demonstrate performance comparison graphs, algorithms and rspamd's internal architecture. The overall talk will consist of 4 components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction to spam filtering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the most popular spam types so far: advertising, fraud, cloaked spam, images spam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What techniques are mainly used to fight spam: adaptive filtering and machine learning, patterns matching, black and white lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it so difficult to write a good spam filtering system: spam for one person could be a useful message for another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is wrong with spam: ethical and security considerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes rspamd different from other state of the art spam filters: internal architecture, plugins and rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which algorithms are optimal to fight spam: OSB Bayes, shingles for fuzzy hashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance optimizations used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to write a spam filter that can filter hundreds of messages per second on commodity hardware: event based architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global and local optimizations used: abstract syntax tree optimizations, branches cut, greedy optimizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the standard approaches are broken: zero terminated strings, many POSIX functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other high performance technologies: hyperscan, pcre jit, aho-corasic tries, radix tries, lua-jit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why encryption is important for all traffic in the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why email security is absolutely essential at all stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes TLS not so easy to introduce in a datacentre: latency issues, hard to use with events, complicated model of trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this talk describes a lot of state-of-the-art methods of spam filtering and other topics, such as writing high performance systems and security in email processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Applying band-aids over security wounds with systemtap</title>
        <subtitle>A data-modification-based approach for fixing the unfixable.</subtitle>
        <track>Systems Administration</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present a live-patching technique based on systemtap's programmable in-situ instrumentation.  These patches are limited to modifying data instead of code, but are often sufficient to put a bandage on a bleeding security vulnerability - or even a plain bug.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some security vulnerabilities can't be patched right away.  Maybe the vendor hasn't provided an update; maybe the service can't be restarted; maybe the software is private, abandoned, or unchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not despair!  Systemtap, a programmable system introspection tool, is customarily used to trace and profile.  But its toolkit includes instruments to poke too - to change state.  It turns out that this is enough to work around many vulnerabilities.  Since systemtap scripts can be run against a live system, we can protect against exploits without a restart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will present a set of approaches and applicability criteria, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and its exploits.  Some problems can be surgically corrected; others require killing the process before it turns to crime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>Systems Administration</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Networks Functions Virtualizationm or NFV, is a very hot industry topic at the moment. What you might not know is what it means - telecommunications companies who have traditionally used only proprietary software to run their core services are now embracing free and open source software, and in the process changing the way they build and deploy core telco serives to be more open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will review what makes up an NFV stack in OPNFV, covering OpenStack, OpenDaylight, Open vSwitch, DPDK, QEMU, the Linux kernel, and other projects. I will present the work being done in these communities to enable the migration of telco applications to this platform, particularly in the areas of improved network dataplane performance, enabling better management of applications running on the platform, and the ability to run real-time guest workloads with KVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also look at the organisational transformation in the telecommunications industry, and the adoption of DevOps and agile practices, and the evolving culture of the telecommunications industry, and how the changes that are happening at the request of the telecommunications industry benefit everyone, from the home hardware hacker hobbyist to IT operations in small and large companies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Why develop eco-conscious Libre Hardware?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;About 5 years ago it hit me that Corporations are never going to take responsibility for Software Libre compliance.  Full Software Libre compliance actually affects their bottom line, and it's the responsibility of Directors to pathologically maximise profits.  In fact, selling eco-conscious products that can be upgraded year-on-year, throwing away perfectly good components in the process, also adversely affects a Corporation's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing with existing profit-maximising Corporations on "Software Libre Compliance" is not a strong selling point: nobody who isn't a programmer actually really cares, and they're not knowledgeable enough to upgrade the software anyway - they'd rather just throw the whole thing away and get a new one, in the naive hope that the new OS will somehow be better, cleaner, and free from the malware attacks that slowed down the perfectly good hardware they just discarded into landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are mainly influenced by money (saving it), cool-factor, convenience and fear. So the trick is to come up with a strategy that plays on all these four things.  The EOMA68 Project thus was envisioned as a way to help people save money (because they can upgrade just like popping out a "Memory Card", they can now push a button and pop out the "Computer Card"), as well as help reassure them on personal security.  Sending the laptop back for repair, you don't want the people in the shop to copy or rifle through your private data?  No problem: pop out the "Computer Card" before sending it off... and incidentally you can pop that Computer Card into a spare base unit and carry on working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as an incidental side-line, then, the products being developed are Software Libre Compliant right from the ground up (not that the end-users really need to know that, as it's not a major selling-point to them).  Some of the products being developed can even be RYF Certified (are FSF-Endorseable) - again, the average end-user doesn't care about this.  However, Software Libre developers will know what's under the hood, and are being invited to participate in bringing these products to market.  The first main products will be two EOMA68-compliant CPU Cards (one with an FSF-Endorseable Ingenic jz4775, the other with an Allwinner A20 dual-core ARM Cortex A7), a Micro-Desktop "base" and a 15.6in 1366x768 Laptop.  The laptop's case is 3D-printable on a standard 200x200mm Mendel90, and uses bamboo laminate for the main panels, to save on plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: where standard Hardware Corporations are set on maximising profits year after year, collectively they've left a gaping hole in the market that, with a little creative thinking, can be filled by someone who is willing to take active responsibility for doing things in a conscientious and principled way.  The resultant products - which have an expected upgrade lifecycle of at least a decade - just happen to be really cool.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>On the Value of Necrocomputing and the Dangers of Monoculture</subtitle>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Postgres documentation says "Code support exists for M32R and VAX, but these architectures are not known to have been tested recently."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenge Accepted! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get Postgres running on the VAX emulator simh started as a whimsical exercise in necrocomputing with no obvious benefit. No users were known and as far as we could determine no users had existed for at least 10 years. In the end it turned up two bits of inefficient code that was depending heavily on IEEE floating point where floating point math wasn't needed at all. It also turned up unexpected issues in the automatic configuration on machines with very limited memory and most suprisingly a NetBSD kernel bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AMENDMENT: How to develop eco-conscious Libre Hardware</title>
        <subtitle>How to make products that save people money and respect Software Freedom at the same time</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;About 5 years ago it hit me that Corporations are never going to take responsibility for Software Libre compliance.  Full Software Libre compliance actually affects their bottom line, and it's the responsibility of Directors to pathologically maximise profits.  In fact, selling eco-conscious products that can be upgraded year-on-year, throwing away perfectly good components in the process, also adversely affects a Corporation's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing with existing profit-maximising Corporations on "Software Libre Compliance" is not a strong selling point: nobody who isn't a programmer actually really cares, and they're not knowledgeable enough to upgrade the software anyway - they'd rather just throw the whole thing away and get a new one, in the naive hope that the new OS will somehow be better, cleaner, and free from the malware attacks that slowed down the perfectly good hardware they just discarded into landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are mainly influenced by money (saving it), cool-factor, convenience and fear. So the trick is to come up with a strategy that plays on all these four things.  The EOMA68 Project thus was envisioned as a way to help people save money (because they can upgrade just like popping out a "Memory Card", they can now push a button and pop out the "Computer Card"), as well as help reassure them on personal security.  Sending the laptop back for repair, you don't want the people in the shop to copy or rifle through your private data?  No problem: pop out the "Computer Card" before sending it off... and incidentally you can pop that Computer Card into a spare base unit and carry on working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as an incidental side-line, then, the products being developed are Software Libre Compliant right from the ground up (not that the end-users really need to know that, as it's not a major selling-point to them).  Some of the products being developed can even be RYF Certified (are FSF-Endorseable) - again, the average end-user doesn't care about this.  However, Software Libre developers will know what's under the hood, and are being invited to participate in bringing these products to market.  The first main products will be two EOMA68-compliant CPU Cards (one with an FSF-Endorseable Ingenic jz4775, the other with an Allwinner A20 dual-core ARM Cortex A7), a Micro-Desktop "base" and a 15.6in 1366x768 Laptop.  The laptop's case is 3D-printable on a standard 200x200mm Mendel90, and uses bamboo laminate for the main panels, to save on plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: where standard Hardware Corporations are set on maximising profits year after year, collectively they've left a gaping hole in the market that, with a little creative thinking, can be filled by someone who is willing to take active responsibility for doing things in a conscientious and principled way.  The resultant products - which have an expected upgrade lifecycle of at least a decade - just happen to be really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Arguman.org is an open source argument mapping platform which was developed by an avid community started in Turkey and spread to the world. It provides a visual critical thinking discussion platform written in python / django and used various open source libraries for various features.  Arguman has 500+ commits and 24+ developer and more non-developer contributers. For the last couple months, the community is working on building a semantic network between arguments and calculating the objection and supporting rate of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the recent years, affordable Brain-Computer Interfaces are becoming more accessible for consumers. Applications range from controlling computers / machines, biofeedback and Quantified Self. At first sight, the current generation of commercial devices seem to be decent in their functionality, and various use cases are suggested. However, neurophysiological signal quality, as well as limitations of software and hardware hackability are among the greatest issues and hurdles towards advancement in user experience. This is why we started to work on Brain-Duino, an open-source brainwave amplifier shield for the Arduino and other microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides: http://brain-duino.com/brainduino&lt;em&gt;fosdem&lt;/em&gt;final.pdf&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Duino is a high quality, low noise and affordable EEG / BCI for hackers, makers, researchers, artists and other enthusiasts. This talk will be about how the brain-Duino project started, where it is now and where it is going. We will briefly explain how EEG works and how to build one, more specifically we will show the parts that Brain-Duino consists of. During the FOSDEM we have a table for you to try out the Brain-Duino and Neurophlex / IBVA software to visualize your brainwaves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Crazyflie 2.0 is the second generation of the Crazyflie nano quadcopter, a flying open source development platform invented by &lt;a href="http://www.bitcraze.io/"&gt;Bitcraze&lt;/a&gt;.
Apart from improved hardware and payload it features a modular design (similar to Arduino shields) which adds new capabilities like
a LED-ring, wireless charging, a camera, GPS or a prototype expansion board. This allows to do hardware and software development on an open platform that fits in the palm of your hand.
The Crazyflie is running on open source software and hardware. It has been used in different private and academic science and research projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the Crazyflie 2.0's modular design (similar to Arduino), new expansion boards (called "decks"), some interesting research projects where it was used and
recent improvements on the software side (e.g. flashing the firmware from a mobile device).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this lightening talk I will take as few turns as possible to explain why and how I decided to program a board game. Yes, a physical, printed board game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at wondrous technologies such as Markdown, Pandoc, LaTeX and chaining them all together to create a multi-format generating workflow and (hopefully) win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Integrating Java into a legacy C progam</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I intend to demonstrate how we had integrated the Java virtual machine into a multi-threaded, pluginized C program. If you have ever encountered the problem that something only has Java API while you intend to use it with your C / C++ code, this talk is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of syslog-ng is to become a major player in the big data logging infrastructure market. Our aim is to be the fastest and most reliable logging software that can send messages to most big data tools, for example Elasticsearch, Hadoop and Kafka. Most big data software uses Java API. Originally, syslog-ng has been written in C, with the pros and cons of the language. Although there are a few 3rd party tools in C language, utilizing these results in encountering several problems, for example difficulties when we attempt to follow the original libraries, maintenance issues, and so on. Therefore, in order to stay up-to-date with the big data tools, we must use the official Java APIs. This is why we have started our “Java language binding” project. We also hope that this project will be an important factor in the syslog-ng community, because now anyone who wants to contribute to improving syslog-ng by developing plugins in Java can do so.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Working with CScout, the C Refactoring Browser</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Despite its maturity and popularity, the C programming language still lacks tool support for reliably performing even simple refactoring, browsing, or analysis operations.  This is primarily due to identifier scope complications introduced by the C preprocessor.  The CScout refactoring browser analyses complete program families by tagging the original identifiers with their precise location and classifying them into equivalence classes orthogonal to the C language's namespace and scope extents.  A web-based user interface provides programmers with an intuitive source code analysis and navigation front-end, while an SQL-based backend allows more complex source code analysis and manipulation.  CScout has been successfully applied to many medium and large open source and proprietary projects identifying thousands of modest refactoring opportunities.  Projects where CScout has been applied include the Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris kernels, Apache httpd, awk, PostgreSQL, and gdb.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Converting LiquidThreads to Flow</title>
        <subtitle>Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the batch</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Flow is a structured discussion system for MediaWiki wikis, including Wikipedia.  Development is led by the Collaboration team at the Wikimedia Foundation, and we have gradually begun using it on Wikimedia projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LiquidThreads, an older structured discussion system for MediaWiki wikis, is still in use on some Wikimedia wikis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both projects aim to foster Wikimedia collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been converting discussions from LiquidThreads to Flow, to reduce technical debt and make Flow's new features and design available to more users.  We have implemented resumable batch software to complete this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be a playful, guided walk through Wikimedia's conversion, exploring how batch software for a complex system has been developed, debugged, and (repeatedly) troubleshooted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come hear about the batch architecture and the conversion process.  Topics will include performance issues with long-running batch jobs and the challenges of mapping between systems with different data models.   Plus, hear why a post about broken JavaScript broke our node.js service, what characters are (really) allowed in HTML 5 and XML, why "Ciudad de México" was the last page I converted in Mexico City, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Flow is a structured discussion system for MediaWiki wikis, including Wikipedia.  Development is led by the Collaboration team at the Wikimedia Foundation, and we have gradually begun using it on Wikimedia projects.  Flow has its own data model and storage for discussions, posts, and revisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other discussion mechanisms on Wikipedia, Flow has a modern user experience.  We also plan to extend Flow to support workflows. Workflows would, for example, allow people to use a structured process to discuss elevating an article to “featured” quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LiquidThreads, an older structured discussion system for MediaWiki wikis, is still used on some Wikimedia wikis.  It uses the standard page- and revision-based storage system.  LiquidThreads has a somewhat different feature set from Flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both projects aim to foster Wikimedia collaboration, especially for new users.  The Collaboration team has been converting discussions from LiquidThreads to Flow, to reduce technical debt and make Flow's new features and design available to projects that want it.  We have implemented resumable batch software to complete this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be a playful, guided walk through Wikimedia's conversion, exploring how batch software for a complex system has been designed, developed, debugged, and (repeatedly) troubleshooted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come hear about the batch architecture and the conversion process.  I'll briefly explain how the pluggable conversion architecture we developed initially supports converting from LiqudThreads, but could be used to convert from other discussion systems in the future.  I'll cover some of the challenges of mapping between systems with different data models. The talk will also explain how we tested against production data locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also discuss how we staged such a large conversion, and the ordering of pages we chose.  Converting certain pages first allowed us to reduce user impact while bugs were ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will also consider performance issues with long-running batch jobs, particularly memory leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why a post about broken JavaScript broke our JavaScript service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why a post about broken XML broke our XML parser (and what characters are (really) allowed in HTML 5 and XML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why "Ciudad de México" was the last page I converted in Mexico City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why bash is not the best Unicode toolkit available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Measure Twice, Code Once</title>
        <subtitle>Understanding Network Benchmarks</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The networking subsystems of any operating system have grown in complexity as the set of protocols and features supported has grown since the birth of the Internet. Firewalls, Virtual Private Networking, and IPv6 are just a few of the features present in the kernel that were not even envisioned when the original UNIX releases were developed over 30 years ago. Advances in networking hardware, with 10Gbps NIC cards being available for only a few hundred dollars, have far outstripped the speeds for which the kernel’s network software was originally written. As with the increasing speed of processors over the last 30 years, systems developers and integrators have always depended on the next generation of hardware to solve the current generation’s performance bottlenecks, often without resorting to any coherent form of measurement. This presentation shows developers and systems integrators at all proficiency levels how to benchmark networking systems, with specific examples. Common pitfalls are called out and addressed and a set of representative tests are given, all using open source software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The technical challenges in developing a benchmark aren’t limited to avoiding lying to the reader. Figuring out how to measure something reliably and repeatably in a dynamic system requires a deep understanding of all of the system components and how interactions among them can conspire to create false measurements. A non-networked system, where the interconnections and interactions among the various components are, or should be, visible, is still complex enough to trip up many developers. A networked system is far harder to measure for several reasons, including: asynchrony, visibility and the lack of well synchronized clocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will present our experiences measuring various components of the FreeBSD network subsystems, including generic forwarding, IPSEC, TCP as well as both of the commonly used firewalls (IPFW and PF). We present not only our measurements but the lessons learned in finding the right measurements and how to reliably reproduce our results. Common pitfalls are called out and addressed and a set of representative tests are given. A secondary outcome of this work is a simples, open source, system for network test coordination, Conductor, which is also described.  All of our code, scripts, configurations, and test results are open source and hosted on github.  This work is part of an ongoing longitudinal study of kernel network performance which continues to evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A C++ API to ease microcontroller programming</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This project provides a C++ library that eases microcontroller programming.
Its aim is to provide an interface simple enough to be able to create complex applications, and optimized enough to enable small microcontrollers to execute these applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other aspect of this library is to be multiplatform. Indeed, it is designed to provide the same API for a simulator (named SASIAE) and for AVR-based and ARM-based microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The project began in 2014 while my association, Eirbot, was participating to the French contest of Eurobot. Indeed, the association faced a new challenge. The robots, which were controlled by AVR-based microcontrollers would be controlled by ARM-based microcontrollers. The objective was to renew an old code written in C, and make use of a simulator to test the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues, and some others, Aversive++ offers these services :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a base code to design control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a communication layer with some systems used in robotics (GPS, accelerometers, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a lot of tools to manage the application's memory securely, mainly by applying the same constraints as in the aeronautics industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the C++ philosophy : what you don't use doesn't cost you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to execute the application of a microcontroller on a simulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being multi platform. Actually, being able to use the same application code on different microcontollers with a few or no modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a compile-time verification feature. Indeed, it is possible to warn the user when he is using badly the microcontroller before even executing the code. This will help the testing phase of an embedded project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cytomine (http://cytomine.be, source code on https://github.com/cytomine) is, to the best of our knowledge, the first open-source rich internet application to enable highly collaborative and multidisciplinary analysis of multi-gigapixel imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built at the University of Liège with state-of-the-art RESTful (Grails), noSQL (MongoDB, Redis) and automated deployment (Docker) technologies, it supports both remote visualization, collaborative semantic annotation, and semi-automated analysis through the web, making it an ideal tool for collaborative research, teaching and diagnosis in every large-image related topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its design was driven by life science and bioimage informatics research needs: software versatility, interoperability, modularity and extensibility, image recognition tailored via learning from ground-truth data and proofreading tools, reproducible research, and data accessibility and reusability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is being used for years by our collaborators working with large sets of bioimages in numerous domains including cancer research, development, and toxicology, and is now adapted for pedagogical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, we believe Cytomine is an important new tool of broad interest to foster active communication and distributed collaboration between life, computer and citizen scientists, but also physicians, teachers and students, in an unprecedented way using machine learning and web communication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5 years of active developpement, use in research and education, our team will be proud to annonce at FOSDEM that the entire source code will be available at this date under an Apache (v2) licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lightning talk will focus on Cytomine main features, illustrated by research and teaching practical examples, and will broach how we want to carry on our project in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A versatile, scalable IRC Bouncer, as a service, for humans</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ircb, or IRC Bouncer, is an attempt to make next gen IRC bouncer as a service, from the ground up. It focuses on:
- easy setup, deployment, management
- low barrier and automated entry point for users
- handle scale:
  - support multiple nodes to distribute connections to IRC networks
  - load balance client connections
  - optimize network IO usage, by using intelligent caching
- support multiple client connections for the same connection to IRC network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code: https://github.com/waartaa/ircb/
Design doc: https://github.com/waartaa/ircb/wiki/Design-docs&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ircb&lt;a href="https://github.com/waartaa/ircb"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; is a IRC Bouncer as a service, made for humans. It's currently functional as a basic IRC bouncer, however, unlike mainstream IRC bouncers, it supports multiple client connections for the same IRC network connection for a user. It aims to provide a scalable bouncer service along with easy setup, deployment and management. It also envisions to provide a low barrier entry point for users, where users can join and start using the service in an automated fashion, without going through manual processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, ircb is a standalone product, it is also one of the core components of waartaa&lt;a href="https://www.waartaa.com"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. waartaa is our attempt to create an open source SAAS communication and collaboration tool, around IRC. We also participated in GSoC under the
Fedora umbrella. However, we hit various roadblocks with the initial code base given to it's monolithic structure. So, we started breaking down the app into micro services. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;ircb&lt;/strong&gt;, the scalable IRC bouncer
to empower waartaa, was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRC networks limit the number of connections for an IP, and this limit has to be manually negotiated, and the process takes time. We came to know of this during maintaining a demo instance of waartaa on a single node, when Freenode will stop rejecting IRC connections from our IP. That's why we are looking forward to have a multi node model for ircb, where we can intelligently distribute the IRC network connections, as needed. We are also brainstorming to figure out an intelligent way to load balance connections from IRC clients to the bouncer service in a stateless fashion. You can find some insight about it in our initial design docs&lt;a href="https://github.com/waartaa/ircb/wiki/Design-docs"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. We are also trying to develop a reactive store layer to empower realtime applications, in our case, waartaa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to showcase our project to the intelligent folks present at FOSDEM with the hope of getting valuable feedback and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Mail2Voice Next - the future of an accessible email client</title>

        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mail2Voice is an accessible email client designed for illiterates and cognitive impaired people. After a long way, a first stable version was published in 2015. However, right after, we engaged discussions about the future of the client. How could we address the remaining flaws and propose a totally redesigned software? This talk will present answers and new questions we found for Mail2Voice Next.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mail2Voice is a project with a simple idea in mind: how can I use emails when I'm not able to read nor to write? From this simple question the illiterates and cognitive impaired are confronted to, Laurent Claude decided to start the Mail2Voice project. It took a while before getting a stable version but it finally came in 2015 after years of development. Still, the results were not as high as expected so we started thinking about Mail2Voice Next. This project intends to drop the current code base entirely and start anew with a better approach, based on our experience. This talk will put in light the flaws of the current software and expose what we tried, failed and achieved to address these issues. We will also discuss about the remaining questions and the perspectives of Mail2Voice Next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Beacons in public transport for visually-impaired people in a FOSS mobile app</title>
        <subtitle>Everything simple for simply everyone</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SASA AG, as public transport operator in major cities in South Tyrol (Italy), has introduced a Bluetooth Beacon infrastructure in their busnetwork in order to make users lives easier. With the app SASAbus users can access real-time passenger information very easily as with the help of the Bluetooth Beacons the exact users' position is selected automatically. To achieve this, the app combines FOSS and OpenData.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing Bluetooth Beacons in our FOSS mobile Application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to say is that we, SASA AG, are a public transport company in major cities in South Tyrol (Italy) with a strong philosophy of using OpenData and OpenSource to approach our daily challenges. Our mobile application, called SASAbus, provides Real-time Passenger Information, such as information on delays, busnetwork updates, etc. But there we encountered also some issues: to see the real-time departures of the buses, the users had to choose the bus stop manually, because, as everybody knows, in the urban area GPS is not as precise as expected. However, not everyone knows the name of every bus stop, and for people with special needs, for example visually impaired people, it is even harder to type the right bus stop name.
To resolve these problems, we decided to put in place a Bluetooth beacon infrastructure on the buses and also on the bus stops. With this infrastructure the application can get information on the exact users' position: where are they waiting for the bus or in which bus are they traveling. Users get the real-time departures automatically when they open the app on the bus stop or directly on the bus, so they know in every moment everything about their trip. This can be for example very important for visually impaired people, because they obviously cannot see where they are: they have either to trust other passengers or their Smartphones. We released the entire source code of our FOSS app under the GPLv3 license and also the beacons' IDs (Creative Commons) in order that everything can be used by other programmers to create some beautiful apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to explain you the concept and the work we have done further in my talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The road to liberating software at the lower levels</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Liberating the software running at the lower levels of the hardware we use, either on the main processor or on controllers and peripherals can reveal to be quite challenging. There is a series of (more or less) usual limitations to overcome in the process, each of them being a challenge for free software developers, with the potential of fatally blocking a free software implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will highlight the process of liberating the software running at the lower levels of devices we use. In particular, it will focus on each recurrent limitation that is encountered when freeing a device, with an insight on the process to overcoming them, when possible at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various examples will be shown, drawn from experience liberating mobile devices at the operating system level (with Replicant), at the bootloader level and other devices such as a Chromebook laptop and another laptop's embedded controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the question of the free software replacement's installation process for end users will be mentioned, with positive and negative examples and suggestions for making the process less painful in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;With JDK 9 development underway in the OpenJDK Community, and based on our experiences with open source projects testing against JDK 9 Early Access builds in the Quality Outreach effort, it seems like a good idea to compile the accumulated wisdom to make it easier for new projects to start testing against JDK 9. In this session, you'll learn how to prepare your code for some of the upcoming changes in JDK 9 and how to join the OpenJDK crowd testing fun with your own open source project to help make JDK 9 better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the not so well-known tools of the HotSpot VM is its Whitebox-Testing API. Introduced in Java 7 it has been significantly improved and extended in Java 8 and 9. It can be used to query or change HotSpot internals which are not otherwise exposed to Java-land. While its features make it an indispensable tool for writing good HotSpot regression tests, it can also be used for experiments or for the mere fun of peeking into the VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview of the Whitebox-Testing API, it will show you how to build and use it and finally it will explain how the API can be easily extend to fit your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Difference between Theory and Practice is greater in practice then it is in theory.  We are on the brink of our first official release of Shenandoah.
It took two weeks to write up the design and over two years to implement it. This talk will discuss the differences between what we initially proposed and what we now have working.  An honest look at compromises, wrong turns, and
innovations.  We will finish the talk with the theory of what comes next: A high level design for NUMA aware GC, a sketch of a plan for truly pauseless GC, a brief consideration of reference counting...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I presented some work I had done on the ARM microJIT to enable it on the Raspberry PI. At the end I suggested the creation of an AArch32 project to do a fully fledged ARM32 port. I am pleased to say that an OpenJDK AArch32 port has been created and we have an initial port of the Template Interpreter thanks to some excellent work by Joseph Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will update on the progress of the AArch32 project and also a call for help so we can finally get the ARM32 properly supported in OpenJDK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you receive a report of a bug which causes a segfault (i.e. a memory exception) in the HotSpot Java VM very occasionally.  This bug only occurs about one time in ten; it might take many hours before it happens.  It has only been observed when running one particular piece of proprietary software.  It only seems to occur on one large machine when running many concurrent threads and a huge heap.  There is a clue: it only seems to happen when running the parallel scavenge garbage collector.  But you've no real idea of how the garbage collector works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened to me in 2015.  I'm used to being able to find and fix bugs, but this one resisted all of my attempts for a long time.  As far as I can recall it's the most difficult bug I've ever fixed.  In hunting this bug I used every tool available to me as a HotSpot developer.  I'll describe them and how they were used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't much talk about debugging.  Many of us spend much of our time doing it, but not talking or writing about this important activity. We should talk about it more.  If there's time it would be good to swap war stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Marlin renderer, a successful fork and join the OpenJDK 9 project</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Marlin renderer is an open source java2D anti-aliasing renderer, forked
from the OpenJDK's Pisces renderer, i.e. a pure-Java software renderer.
This small project, with only 2 contributors (Me and Andrea Aimé), is
hosted on my github (GPL v2) since 01/2014 to provide a faster alternative
with very good scalability to both Pisces &amp;amp; Ductus (closed-source C)
renderers. I made an important personal effort to optimize the memory
footprint, rewrite Pisces's algorithms, run regression tests &amp;amp; our MapBench
benchmarks (serialized maps). Many binary releases were published in 2014,
compatible with both OpenJDK &amp;amp; Oracle JDK 7 / 8, but mainly used by the
GeoServer &amp;amp; gvSIG CE projects (web and desktop open source GIS) which
provided complex rendering use cases and user feedbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my participation to FOSDEM 2015, I discussed with the OpenJDK
community how to contribute the Marlin renderer back. I joined the
graphics-rasterizer project in march 2015 to contribute Marlin as a new
standalone renderer for OpenJDK9. I worked hard with Jim Graham &amp;amp; Phil Race
(java2d team) and we proposed the JEP 265: Marlin Graphics Renderer in July
2015. It is now integrated and that intensive work made Marlin even faster !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, you will learn how Marlin works (java2d pipeline, AA
algorithm, tuning &amp;amp; benchmark results), how to use it, what performance
optimizations were made and of course, my feedback on contributing to
OpenJDK. Of course, I will also make a demo comparing OpenJDK Pisces vs
Marlin on intensive rendering tasks (based on MapBench).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I would really like to get people helping me to implement new
algorithms (clipping, more precise pixel coverage computation, efficient
gamma correction) or just try Marlin with their applications to gather more
user feedbacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thermostat has evolved a log way from being a specialised tool for
performance monitoring and analysis of the JVM, first by encompassing
a generic framework for performance analysis and data visualisation
and now with the addition of a powerful and advanced new Platform
infrastructure that also allow users to build completely standalone
projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Platform offers a familiar environment that handles Model View and
Controllers objects, presentation layer, threading models,
visualisation and also special effects, and a new data architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will demonstrate how to build an application
based on Thermostat in few simple steps and how to take advantage of
the new architecture to build stunning and visually appealing
applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;BMUnit is the package which integrates Byteman into JUnit and TestNG, enabling you to locally redefine the behaviour of application or JDK runtime code for the duration of a single test or group of related tests. BMUnit is very simple to use; just add a few annotations to your test classes and place a few jars in your classpath. This talk will explain how BMUnit works by presenting and executing tests which exemplify the 3 most common use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;injecting trace code so you can be sure your tests enter the expected
code paths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;injecting validation rules so you can assert that specific outcomes do
occur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;injecting 'faults' to modify state or control flow, driving the
application or JDK runtime down the path needed to exercise a desired
test scenario&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Please note that this talk replaces 'Displaying Application Events in Thermostat Using Byteman')&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard your colleagues discussing for weeks why your product is so slow? Did everyone have different components under suspicion? Did you sit in front of a project consisting of tens of thousands of lines of code and tried to pin down the bottle necks? Don't want to use proprietary services like New Relic APM or XRebel?
In this presentation we will have a closer look on how to make visible what is inside your Java monolith with Hystrix by Netflix. After an overview is given, I will show how we implemented Hystrix into oVirt to hunt down bottle necks and architectural problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When Oracle released Java 7 GA, it contained a serious loop optimization bug, affecting Apache projects like Lucene, Solr, or Elasticsearch. Since that time, the Apache Lucene team works together with the Oracle and OpenJDK developers to test early-access releases with Apache Lucene's codebase. Due to Apache Lucene's heavy, low level code with many tight loops and unusual code patterns, it is an ideal testing environment for the Hotspot optimizer. Loops, iterators, and bitset operations are executed millions of times per full text query to execute finite state automata, collect and filter results, and sort them. Bugs caused by mis-compilation of code that are hard to reproduce in isolation can be easily reproduced with Lucene. In addition, Lucene uses a pseudo-randomized testing infrastructure triggering different Hotspot optimizations on each test execution. In this talk, Uwe will show the current state of Java 9 EA testing. He will also present the problems caused by hard to reproduce issues, e.g. occurred after the changes to arraycopy or AVX optimizations in Hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There is a new, Blink-compatible API in Firefox called WebExtensions. Extension code written for Chrome, Opera, or, possibly in the future, Microsoft Edge will run in Firefox with few changes as a WebExtension. It will be shown how to use this API to develop addons for Firefox OS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For some time we’ve heard from add-on developers that our APIs could be better documented and easier to use. In addition, we’ve noticed that many Firefox add-on developers also maintain a Chrome, Safari, or Opera extension with similar functionality. We would like add-on development to be more like Web development: the same code should run in multiple browsers according to behavior set by standards, with comprehensive documentation available from multiple vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, we are implementing a new, Blink-compatible API in Firefox called WebExtensions. Extension code written for Chrome, Opera, or, possibly in the future, Microsoft Edge will run in Firefox with few changes as a WebExtension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SUMO (short for Support Mozilla) is a volunteer-powered, international support platform with millions of visitors speaking multiple languages, each month.
Learn from us how to build a fully localizable wiki-like site (yes, we're forkable on GitHub!) and help us help others with your coding (and not only) skills.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the Kitsune platform, and the work that's done on it and with it, by our developers and volunteers.
Apart from presenting the scale and background of Kitsune, the presentation will also offer options of getting involved in our project for the greater good of the helpful web around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many people find delegating to be one of the more difficult elements of leadership. This session will discuss barriers to delegating, how to overcome them, and how to give good feedback to others.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Delegation is important because it helps to prevent burnout, develops skills in others, and generates a culture of enthusiasm, innovation, creativity, cooperation, and openness. Delegating allows you to be more effective and productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we'll talk about ways to effectively delegate, common barriers and concerns, and how you can help your delegatee be successful. We'll also talk about how to give good feedback to those you delegate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Please note that the title of this presentation was changed after the booklet was printed.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When Firefox crashes, it asks you to submit a crash report. If you send it (please do), it actually helps us at Mozilla to improve Firefox. The same is true for some other data that your browser can provide. This talk will look into what mechanisms exist, what the data is, and how we use it to improve Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

It subsequently shipped to the world as RFC 7540, has been adopted by all major browsers, the most popular web servers and an ever growing number of sites. This is a recap of what the protocol is, what it means for browsers and sites and not the least how the adoption rate looks like now. What's the biggest obstacles in the way for turning on HTTP/2 on your site?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Firefox has recently gained an API designed to let developers and add-on developers monitor in real-time the performance of add-ons, webpages or Firefox itself. In this talk, I will present this API, and what we did to make it work reliably and without reducing the performance of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WebIDL is the language used in specification to describe the syntax of an API. Major browsers are not only using it, but are also publishing the WebIDL of what they really implement.
This talk will explain the standard language, as well as some Gecko-extensions, in simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will:
- present the syntax of the standard language and how it maps to actual properties and methods in JavaScript.
- explain some of the current standard annotations like [SameObject] and [NewObject]
- explain some extensions used in Gecko to add more semantic to the file.
- inform where to find the actual WebIDL files as implemented by the different rendering engines.
- explain how this info is used beyond browser developers, like for documentation purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid of WebIDL anymore!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lowering the barrier of entry and working on hardware &amp;amp; microcontrollers using JavaScript and open web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A whole new class of microcontrollers (such as the Espruino, Tessel 2 or MozOpenHard Chirimen or BBC MicroBit) are enabling new ways for interacting with hardware - we are not limited to clunky and error-prone low-level languages, and proprietary tools any more: new tools are built in HTML5 &amp;amp; JavaScript, and hardware can be programmed in more user-friendly languages such as JavaScript or even Python. Knowing how to wield the powers of open web technologies, we can build our own tools and create our own hardware devices, robots, automatons or interconnected IoT devices; even build our own tools to help us along the way. All this using nothing more, than HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. During the talk I will show several such easy-to-understand demos, interconnected microcontrollers controlled from phones (but no apps, only the browser!) and tools built entirely on web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Often micro-benchmarks are used to decide a feature is slower or faster than another.
Javascript engines are getting better and better and as a result micro-benchmarks show performance that has no correlation with the used feature.
Here I will debunk some micro-benchmarks by explaining what happens internally in the Javascript engine, together with formulating advice on how to properly benchmark features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

That's why Firefox has introduced new features for tracking protection and private browsing.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How can we grow the MySQL Community?  It has always been hard to find qualified MySQL Developers and Database Administrators and there is still a great shortage.  The NoSQL world has bright shinny 'toys' and MySQL is now in a 'young adult stage'.  With containerization and verbalization there is more demand for the MySQL skills but that does not seem to be growing the community at the same pace.  So how do we promote our community to attract more people, how do we promote the knowledge of MySQL skills to hiring managers, is there a way to mentor new people as does the PHP Community, and how do we provide support for each other.  Please come to provide your ideas so we can get more of us.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How can we grow the MySQL Community?  It has always been hard to find qualified MySQL Developers and Database Administrators and there is still a great shortage.  The NoSQL world has bright shinny 'toys' and MySQL is now in a 'young adult stage' which keeps us from the 'new and flashy' crowd.  With containerization and verbalization there is more demand for the MySQL skills but that does not seem to be growing the community at the same pace. The MySQL Certification exams are much more difficult and maybe more relevant to the true job functions but it seems to have slipped in prestige. AWS, Aurora, other other similar technologies are MySQL-like but how do we leverage those professionals into the MySQL Community?  So how do we promote our community to attract more people, how do we promote the knowledge of MySQL skills to hiring managers, is there a way to mentor new people as does the PHP Community, and how do we provide support for each other. I honestly think it is time we try to coalesce strategies to help build and promote the MySQL community.  Please come to provide your ideas so we can get more of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL Group Replication is a recent MySQL plugin that brings together
group communication techniques and database replication, providing
both a high availability and a multi-master update everywhere
replication solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High availability is achieved through redundancy, by consistently
replicating data throughout a set of MySQL servers. Multi-master
update everywhere is based on row-level conflict detection on the fact
that the plugin leverages distributed coordination among servers to
deploy consistent conflict handling. Thus the system behaves as a
replicated state machine.
To have all this working together, there is an underlying work of a
well-known paradigm in distributed computing: Group Communication and
Distributed Consensus - that is becoming quite hot in the software
industry nowadays, along with with top-notch software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and learn what it is, where to get it and how to use it. Get to
know how to install, configure and deploy it in your existing
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The MariaDB CONNECT storage engine now offers access to JSON file and allows you to see a external JSON file as a MariaDB table. The CONNECT storage Engine has the capability to auto discover a table structure when the table correspond to external data.
The MariaDB CONNECT storage engine comes with a set of UDFs (user defined functions) to manipulate the JSON format. This JSON content can be stored in a normal text column. This approach can be used as a way to implement dynamic columns.
Beside JSON the MariaDB CONNECT Storage Engine allows to access various file formats (CSV, XML, JSON, Excel, etc). It also gives access to any ODBC data sources (Oracle, DB2, SQLServer, etc).
These various capabilities of foreign datasources access makes it a perfect tool for data integration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>More on gdb for MySQL DBAs</title>
        <subtitle>Using gdb to study MySQL internals and as a last resort</subtitle>
        <track>MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This session is about using GNU debugger (gdb) as a tool to study MySQL internals (namely, InnoDB locks and metadata locks) and as a last resort in cases when server hangs or has to be restarted for other reason. It never hurts to try a trick or two before giving up and restarting.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes MySQL DBAs have to work with stalled/hanged/unresponsive MySQL instance, where their usual SQL-based tricks do not work any more. Sometimes they can not even connect to check what's going on inside server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases they know what to do and everything still works, but they have to implement changes to read-only server variables. Server restart is often not an option in production, as it means some downtime and may cause negative performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases one could do something given read and write access to server memory/internals. Here comed gdb, that, alone with careful reading of the source code helps to often resolve the problems described above. During this session I'll show what can be done with gdb when server already is in troubles, and how to use gdb to "see" and understand MySQL internals (like InnoDB locks or metadata locks) better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Clusternaut: Orchestrating Percona XtraDB Cluster with Kubernetes</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk is about orchestrating Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) nodes atop Google Container Engine (GCE) with Kubernetes. PXC provides for synchronous replication among MySQL nodes through the WSREP (writeset replication) API, and Galera plugin which implements it, to provide group communication and configuration through extended virtual synchrony (EVS). While it can be run in isolation, GCE provides other architectural elements such as fluentd for logging, etcd for co-ordination, skydns for DNS among others, which are vital in this design.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is about orchestrating Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) nodes atop Google Container Engine (GCE) with Kubernetes. PXC provides for synchronous replication among MySQL nodes through the WSREP (writeset replication) API, and Galera plugin which implements it, to provide group communication and configuration through extended virtual synchrony (EVS). While it can be run in isolation, GCE provides other architectural elements such as fluentd for logging, etcd for co-ordination, skydns for DNS among others, which are vital in this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Key elements of the talk will be:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Details of PXC and synchronous replication that it provides while ensuring ACID compliance with MVCC. Extended virtual synchrony (EVS) will also be described as are its CAP limitations. Finally, existing deployment strategies of PXC will also be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) The Docker image built for PXC. The design is intended to be flexible and extensible, either from git or from release packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) Initial docker-compose, designing and porting to Kubernetes. Docker-compose has been used for a while to bring up a ‘N’ node cluster with minimal configuration. Some of the elements in this design cannot be used with Kubernetes as is. Thus, details of porting will be discussed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i ) Each PXC node goes into a Pod. Same Pod may also contain other optional services like xinetd or haproxy. While having Pods may be sufficient, it will not be making use of Kubernetes fully. Hence, Replication Controllers (RC) are used to control Pod placement and lifetimes. The Pod and RC configuration will be discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii) The nature of architecture and bootstrapping of cluster. PXC is a master-less cluster which requires a bootstrapped node that others can connect to in order to form the cluster. Kubernetes, while not allowing for direct linking among containers, allows for service endpoints. A ‘cluster’ service endpoint is created for cluster group communication and client connections. The service endpoint also provides load-balancing and high availability as desired side effects. This addresses the agnostic approach and allows for simpler, more elegant bootstrapping for PXC (a strong benefit of deployment with Kubernetes over normal deployment of PXC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iii) Database itself is mounted through volumes allowed for by both Docker and Kubernetes. This also allows for persistence and separation of data and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iv) Dynamic generation of JSON Pod configuration is required to allow for certain runtime elements to be injected into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, future work will be discussed: benchmarking, application Pods, CAP testing (akin to jepsen), integration with Apache Mesos and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go code for this is already up and running at https://github.com/ronin13/pxc-kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Docker and MySQL are two mainstream technologies that are reshaping the IT environment and the web economy. While using MySQL is reasonably straightforward, using it in Docker may prove challenging.
This talk will show the main points of Docker operations with plenty of easy-to-follow examples, including MySQL in replication using containers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Running database operations in containers is a slightly different proposition than running other services. MySQL, being designed - as the majority of services - for running in a dedicated host, needs some adjusting to fit in a container.
Thanks to its configurability, we can deploy many MySQL containers to fit our purposes, with just the right amount of customization. However, customizing MySQL in Docker is not as easy as it would be when you have a full machine at your disposal.
This talk will show examples of how to combine MySQL best practices with the ones that apply to containers. The net result will be the deployment of dozens of MySQL instances with little effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Introducing new SQL syntax and improving performance with preparse Query Rewrite Plugins</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Do you miss SQL commands which MySQL does not support? Do you want it to have missed SQL standard features or intruduce new fancy command? Maybe contribute fix to https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2 "Does not make Toast"? Or just replace badly written query with more efficient? With pre-parse Query Rewrite Plugings you can do most of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session I will demonstrate how to create, install and use Query Rewrite plugins. We will introduce completely new SQL command and let MySQL execute it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of September 2014, just before Oracle Open World conference, one of MySQL Labs releases presented a new killer feature for MySQL 5.7: Query Rewrite Plugins for optimizer! This is a long waited way for MySQL to both preprocess/modify query on the fly without any middle-tire software like MySQL Proxy (that can easily become a bottleneck or single point of failure) and force proper execution plan, without any change in application code. We can get functionality similar to stored outlines of Oracle RDBMS and more, as MySQL provides APIs for both literal query rewrite before parsing and for accessing/modifying query tree after parsing. During this session I will identify most important real life use cases for query rewrites, explore the features of Rewriter plugin originally created by Oracle engineers for their Lab release and provide some details about APIs and writing your own custom plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Query Rewrite Plugins are part of current MySQL GA version 5.7. This means this is the time to actively explore them and use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will also present benchmark results from real Booking.com workloads.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 24 months, MySQL replication speed has improved a lot thanks to implementing  parallel replication.  MySQL and MariaDB have different types of parallel replication; in this talk, I present in detail the different implementations, with their limitations and the corresponding tuning parameters (covering MySQL 5.6, MariaDB 10.0, MariaDB 10.1 and MySQL 5.7).  I also present benchmark results from real Booking.com workloads.  Finally, I discuss some deployments at Booking.com that benefits from parallel replication speed improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I discuss about what is certification and group communication explaining how it's performed.  I also cover the difference between MySQL 5.6 GTID and Galera GTID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always say Galera replication in synchronous... is it really ? Always ? For every steps ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the caveats of such replication ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this presentation, the audience should be comfortable with terms like Brute Force Abort, Flow Control, Local Certification Failure... and now what does virtual-synchronous mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is to demystify this technology with easy illustrations and analogies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the talk we will present a method how to confine your IT infrastructure (at
any scale) against the requirements of Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data
Security Standard (DSS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics covered within the talk include:
* PCI DSS introduction,
* language specifications used for automated assessment of security compliance,
* details of PCI DSS benchmark implementation in the SCAP Security Guide,
* demonstration of manual assessment of single computer using open-source tools
  from the OpenSCAP ecosystem,
* performing corrective operations (remedial action),
* presentation of open-source solution to install PCI DSS compliant system
  from the scratch,
* large scale open-source solutions combining systems management with security
  compliance&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the talk we will present a method how to confine your IT infrastructure (at
any scale) against the requirements of Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data
Security Standard (DSS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with brief PCI DSS introduction, we will proceed to consult commonly
used language specifications (XCCDF, OVAL) used for automated assessment of
security compliance of a computer infrastructure. Having the basic blocks
defined, we will present the details of implementation of PCI-DSS security
benchmark in the SCAP Security Guide project. Subsequently we will use this
benchmark definition in order to demonstrate a manual assessment of a single
computer using the open-source tools from the OpenSCAP ecosystem. Being
familiar with the basic toolset we will depict how these tools can be used to
perform corrective operations (remedial action) in order the system to reach
the PCI-DSS requirements / compliance. Later we will present motivation behind
ability to install PCI-DSS compliant system right from the scratch, and also
introduce a tool to help us with this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we will conclude with detailing how the presented approach for computer
system(s)'s assessment can be used at large(r) scale introducing open-source
solutions, combining systems management with security compliance. We will
illustrate their application to establish a PCI-DSS compliant infrastructure,
and also briefly document steps to be taken, when compliance against different
security guidance / baseline would be desired. At the end we will sketch where
the development in the area of security compliance might be heading in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MidPoint is an comprehensive open source Identity Management system. It can handle even a very complex enterprise IDM scenarios and it can replace commercial IDM systems. This talk will introduce the basic architecture of Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution with midPoint as the IDM component.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions are almost always composed of several components that needs to be integrated. The Identity Management (IDM) component is the crucial integrating part. However the open source IDM solutions were very simplistic in the past and only commercial IDM solutions were available to handle complex IDM deployments. But now there is a viable open source solution. MidPoint is an open source IDM system that can completely replace commercial products. It has all that an IDM system should have: synchronization, RBAC, attribute mappings, workflow, reporting, governance, etc. It is the most comprehensive open source IDM solution available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk with start by introducing basic components of Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. It will describe the crucial role of an IDM system in the solution. We will argue that no enterprise security project can ever be complete without and IDM and we will show why. We will also describe how midPoint can be a perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the key objection raised on IoT is security.
Adding security to IoT present two challenges faces:
 - the delivery of a secured but flexible small embedded OS
 - the availability of a development environment which enable non security programmer experts to create a safe product.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;IoT is often perceived as a glorified embedded challenge.
While this is technically partially correct, the market vision of delivering &gt;50 Billion devices by 2020 is not compatible with the current small poll of available embedded developers.
The presentation will present solutions which are available in the Open Source and can be used to create an IoT OS and framework which can provide a reasonable security and privacy protection while opening the domain to non expert programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will address the following issues :
 - secured boot on standard Open Source HW.
 - Code and data Integrity
 - Secured upgrade
 - Middleware and Application containment.
 - Developer environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In near future, objects will dialog together through internet or near field hadhock networks. What's about your privacy data? Recent use cases in the automotive industry have shown how much it can cost to under estimate hacker's skills. In our current work for designing a security architecture for cars and connected objects, we used smack LSM and cynara service for isolating applications and services from the baseline system. This model is base on the idea that application should not be trusted, it guarantees that no data can be stolen by application and it supports native, html5 and cloud models.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The market sells more and more connected objects. These objects have a computing unit and most of it are able to connect to some kind of cloud. This is a fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are motivations and interests in developing open frameworks for creation of applications for such objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing the system and its application framework, master pieces of knowledges and feedbacks are expected from telephone industry, where iOS and Androïd showed the high potential of markets for applications. But a car is not a phone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you lend or resell your mobilephone? Is your mobilephone potentially lethal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of the previous questions the answer is yes when the word "telephone" is replaced by the word "automobile". But you could find other devices: camera, watch, television, refrigerator, ... However, automobile seems to be one of the most complex connected object. All of this brings in the front of the scene many usages that are reasking and enforcing our practicals of security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the security considerations linked to my work for AGL (Automotive Grade Linux). AGL is a project of the Linux foundation. AGL project  released its first specification in spring 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will explain how isolation of applications and isolation of in-deep parts of the system are required to ensure privacy and safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A brief introduction on security in the IoT devices. This talk will talk from the perspective of how security is defined in OIC (Open Interconnect Consortium) and implemented in IoTivity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rapid growth and interest in IoT, there is a growing need to address the security vulnerabilities that currently exist. This talk provides an overview of the challenges faced and how they can be
addressed in terms of secure communication, key exchanged and how device to device communication can be controlled. The audience will also learn about the solution developed in IoTivity so far and some of
the ongoing work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tizen 3.0 platform security model</title>
        <subtitle>Security framework for constraining applications' privileges </subtitle>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most important design goal of Tizen 3.0 security framework is to separate applications from user private data and from fragile parts of the operating system. Another important aspect is security policy that is easy to configure. To meet these requirements, we combined usage of widely known DAC and one of the most simple Linux Security Modules - Smack. The talk will also cover set of tools used to control access to abstract resources (Cynara) and tools used to configure all needed policy mechanisms (Security-Manager). Finally, a new module for controlling multi-container virtual environments will be presented (Vasum), that is also part of the Tizen 3.0 security framework. Described security model is open source with repositories publicly available both on tizen.org and github. It is successfully implemented and used on Tizen 3.0 platform with increasing interest from other Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Presentation will introduce design of security framework created for Linux based system - Tizen in version 3.0. This framework main goal is separating third party applications running in user context from user private data and privileged resources (like devices, sockets and services providing access to sensitive resources). We have chosen to combine usage of DAC and MAC, for the latter choosing Linux Security Module - Smack, which is easy to configure and easy to understand. Smack is mainly used to protect data, which can be mapped to system resources - files, sockets, databases. Some resources are more abstract, so they need different kind of protection. Assuming that such resources would be provided by privileged services, each service is encouraged to check access permission through access control tool provided by system. During our research we discovered, that existing tools do not meet all of our requirements (as Polkit proved to be inefficient), hence we have created our own access control tool - Cynara. It's main purpose is to store system policy and provide interfaces for policy changes and permission checks. Such policy is based on identifier of possibly unprivileged application, user in which context this application is running at and privilege - abstract sensitive system resource. To expand possible types of supported policies, Cynara supports custom plugins, which can declare any type of policy. We created AskUser plugin as example, which produces policy based on user decision, through pop-up windows.
For creating and maintaining of system policy Security Manager service was created. It allows to configure and enforce system policy through proper actions taken during application installation and launch. During installation application declares used privileges, then proper system policy is created to allow such usage. User is allowed to change system policy configuration for each application - granting or denying access to each declared privilege even after the application is installed.
Finally, a new module for controlling multi-container virtual environments will be presented. This enables creation of containers which separate processes and graphical environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will learn a bit about how USB devices can do evil things to your system and introduce a new tool, called USBGuard, that helps you to defend against USB-based attacks. The USBGuard software framework helps to protect your computer against rogue USB devices (a.k.a. BadUSB) by implementing a firewall-like system for whitelisting and blacklisting the devices based on their attributes. Finally, some of the advanced and planned features like USB traffic monitoring or network bound USB disk encryption will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Can we run C code and be safe?</title>
        <subtitle>A Linux system protected with Address Sanitizer</subtitle>
        <track>Security</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The talk will present a Linux system completely built with Address Sanitizer. Address Sanitizer is a protection mechanism in the gcc and clang compilers that detects and prevents various memory corruption bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Common C coding bugs like buffer overflows, use after free errors and other errors accessing invalid memory are still amongst the most prevalent security issues in today’s software. Modern operating systems have mitigations like ASLR and Stack Canaries, but they can often be circumvented.
The gcc and clang compilers come with a feature called Address Sanitizer (short: ASAN). It detects memory access bugs at runtime and stops the program execution. Compared to other previous solutions Address Sanitizer is relatively fast, although it still causes a significant performance hit. It can usually be used with real world software without any modifications.
Address Sanitizer is primarily designed as a debugging tool and as such it has been remarkably successful. The speaker has used ASAN in combination with fuzzing to successfully uncover a large number of bugs.
But Address Sanitizer could also be used in production. Recently the Tor project started publishing nightly builds of its browser bundle protected with Address Sanitizer. The speaker will present a fully working Linux system (based on Gentoo) with everything except a few core parts compiled with  Address Sanitizer. Just trying to do that already uncovered several memory access bugs in core packages like bash and coreutils.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Facebook launched an internal initiative to integrate more encryption into its corporate infrastructure. The effort required advanced, yet highly responsive solutions in multiple areas, including vulnerability management, secure key distribution, and support for dated encryption in markets where modern encryption is still not viable. This technical talk will outline how Facebook has implemented some of these systems and provide recommendations for methodologies and open-source tools that could allow other organizations to put them into practice. It will also discuss how Facebook is addressing the challenge of serving SSL to millions of people in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover both technical and organisational topics. Main focuses include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing a software/infrastructure ecosystem that can quickly respond to SSL security issues/other changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling alerting and certificate monitoring, and where in your SSL stack to put such logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to provide both utility and maximum possible security in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things to consider to avoid leaks with new developments in modern SSL infrastructure (for example, Certificate Transparency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactively monitoring potentially malicious new certificate issuances for your domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we have implemented some of these systems at Facebook, with suggestions for open-source tools to help you do the same if you wish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The open-source software plays a vital role in our worldwide computing infrastructure.  When vulnerabilities are discovered in our software, our response can have a major impact on how much risk our end users are exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The XenProject's security response process has been hardened and tested over years of experience, and has weathered several storms.  This talk will share some war stories from our security response process that explain how we got to where it is today, so that you can learn the easy way, from our experience, rather than the hard way, from your own experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will briefly cover the history of response processes -- from non-disclosure to full disclosure to coordinated or "responsible" disclosure, and pre-disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll then cover two major events -- XSA-7, the Intel SYSRET vulnerability; and XSA-108 -- that highlighted some weaknesses in our process, and how we tweaked the process in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll cover how we handled the a very controversial community discussion after XSA-7 in a way which, we hope, gave everyone in the community an opportunity to have their voice heard and counted, in spite of the complete lack of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in these 4 years. The recent addition of the Bug Bounty program being a notable example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s reflect: What has potentially gone wrong? What could have been better and was everything we’ve done really a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>F-Droid: building the private, unblockable app store</title>
        <subtitle>your app store does not need to know who you are</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mass surveillance and targeted attacks on mobile devices are getting easier and more common. A great number of mobile apps have been developed to assist users protect their privacy, but little has been done to address the issues facing distribution of the apps themselves. Basically all of the app stores except F-Droid track their users in detail.  Meanwhile, we are working to make F-Droid even more private. Google Play is blocked in many countries, and app stores like Play or iTunes often censor to comply with regional law, whether just or not. Regional app stores are often cesspools of malware. In many countries, people exchange apps through web forums, email, bluetooth, SD Cards, or any other method they can figure out, whether safe or not. Effective techniques for circumventing censorship and internet outages exist, and work in many places, but none work in all, and it is very difficult to keep track of them all. This current state requires users, trainers, developers, and organizations to be fluent in many technical details in order to effectively get and distribute mobile apps and media around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cuba, people share apps via mesh networks and thumb drives. In Vietnam, swapping apps with Bluetooth is widespread. In China, the internet is ubiquitous but heavily filtered and monitored; but "collateral freedom" techniques have proven effective. Each of these workarounds can also be useful in many other parts of the world so F-Droid is including them all in a unified user experience. All of these distribution methods are included in F-Droid, and we are now working to provide a simple, smooth user experience, with three use cases in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developer is in control of a simple set of commands that automate the entire distribution workflow for making highly secure, reproducible builds then getting them out through all possible channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations and trainers can use these tools to make curated collections of apps and media use, without getting caught up in the technical details of the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end user gets a familiar app store experience, regardless of the complexity behind their successful connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the foundations of a trusted security package is the breadth and range of testing done on it.  There are a number of tools and techniques that can be used to enhance the testing coverage of a library or software package - reducing bugs and vulnerabilities and further gaining the trust of a user base.  This session will go through the different types of testing and tools used to help make the wolfSSL SSL/TLS and wolfCrypt cryptography libraries tested, trusted, and secure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The tragic terrorist attacks in Paris have fueled, even more than before, a strong campaign against widespread adoption of encryption tools, even if it soon became clear that the terrorists hadn't used any.
While in USA plans for the adoption of compulsory backdoors, in order to circumvent encryption, have been apparently abandoned, many European States seem to perceive encryption software and devices as one of the worst evils.
Which is the role of FOSS and FOSS developers in this scenario? How can we enhance communication privacy, without breaking any regulations?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FOSS has always played a key role in enabling secure communications and systems: from encrypting filesystems to allowing anonymous browsing, free and open source tools are fundamental.
In the aftermath of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris, a strong campaign against widespread adoption of encryption tools has gained momentum, even if it soon became clear that the terrorists hadn't used any anonymization technique.
While in USA plans for the adoption of compulsory backdoors, in order to circumvent encryption, have been apparently abandoned, many European States seem to perceive encryption software and devices as one of the worst evils.
How can FOSS and FOSS developers play a part in this scenario?
Will it still be possible to develop and use encryption, to enable communication privacy, or will developers and users run the risk of incurring in some liability?
The talk will examine the current European Legal framework, in order to assess which part can FOSS have in the ever-shifting balance between security and privacy, involving the audience with some case studies and personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Camille has been actively promoting Open Source, Open Standards and interoperability for more than ten years, notably as a member of the AFUL, where he's been a member of the board since 2007.
Leveraging his significant experience in helping corporations defining Open Source strategies and conformance policies, he's co-leading the Open Source governance activity at inno³. He's also particularly
interested in the tooling enabling a better Open Source management.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most dependency managers integrate a licensing dimension to their packages and their contributors are generally very receptive to best practices in the domain, like following the SPDX standard and its evolutions.
The importance of the legal dimension of these tools is underlined by the evolution of the services that are built on top of them: services like versioneye and librairies.io had their primary focus on technical aspects (like detecting not up to date dependencies), but now also includes features related to licensing like licence whitelisting or licence compatibility.
This short talk will present a summary of the maturity of the different package managers licencing-wise, some examples of concrete issues of implementing best practices, and tools that already exist or that are still lacking to allow developpers to take advantage of easily-available licensing information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Legal decisions related to an open source project serve multiple purposes. One of the constituencies of these legal policies is the community of contributors to the project. Unfortunately, the effect of legal policy decisions by a primary copyright holder can have unanticipated negative effects on this constituency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some legal decisions which have an effect on the contributor community are:
*  License choice
*  Contributor licensing agreements
*  Determining origin of contributions and "clearing" them
*  Trademark usage policy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Neary is a community manager with a long history of participating in and organising open source community projects, and he will walk you through some of the ways in which decisions in these areas have actively harmed project growth in the past, and may suggest some alternatives which accomplish similar goals without the same side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Legal decisions related to an open source project serve multiple purposes. Some of those purposes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protection of contributors from legal risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protection of users from legal risks associated with using the software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protection of the good name and brand of the project through trademark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enablement of business models for primary contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But one of the constituencies of an open source project,namely the community of contributors to the project, is often forgotten, or the effect of other legal decisions on them are underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some legal decisions which can have an adverse effect on the contributor community are:
*  License choice
*  Contributor licensing agreements
*  Determining origin of contributions and "clearing" them
*  Trademark usage policy&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When is Distribution not Distribution?</title>
        <subtitle>Triggering the copyleft condition in FOSS licences - what use cases are 'distribution'?</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When is distribution not distribution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Distribution’ triggers copyleft obligations, and accurate interpretation of copyleft licences is dependent on an accurate determination of 'distribution'. In the course of other research, we developed a model containing a spectrum of software use-cases illustrating what activities may result in distribution, as defined in law, and which therefore trigger the copyleft conditions in FOSS licences. This talk explains the model, and the use-cases, and explores, from a European Copyright Law perspective, when software can be considered to have been distributed, and what the consequences are for copyleft in each case, with reference to the GPL, AGPL and other FOSS licences.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In researching a wide range of contracts which Swedish schools require their students to enter into to enable the students to access school computing facilities (including the provision of FOSS), it became clear that a key issue, in the case of each contract, was whether the specific item of FOSS had been ‘distributed’ to the students in question, so as to trigger the copyleft condition of the relevant FOSS licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, we hypothesised a spectrum of cases covering scenarios when distribution definitely occurs (A provides B with a copy of GIMP on a CD), to when it definitely doesn’t occur (A looks over B's shoulder while B is using GIMP and following A's instructions). In between are less clear cases such as: A lends B a phone containing FOSS code; A leases a phone containing FOSS code to B for a year; A allows B to access GIMP on a virtual machine under A’s control; A hands over administrative access to the VM to B. It is not obvious, legally, whether in each of these cases ‘distribution’ has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU case of Peek &amp;amp; Cloppenburg KG v Cassina SpA suggests that distribution can only take place in connection with the transfer of a physical object: a literal reading would suggest that downloading software and transferring it between VMs does not amount to distribution. This case was discussed in UsedSoft GmbH v Oracle International Corp, which approves Cassina, but also considers digital transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been argued (under German law) that software is distributed when its functionality is accessed on a SaaS basis (thus making GPL not only equivalent to AGPL, but actually going somewhat further)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk (25 mins) explores the spectrum of use cases, and considers which, under European copyright law, are likely to be considered as triggering copyleft provisions. It also considers whether the result is likely to differ depending on the (copyleft) licence employed, and what some of the practical implications of this analysis may be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Why Open Core Licensing Sucks!!</title>
        <subtitle>Open-core or partially proprietary licensing model is worse than fully proprietary licensing model</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Newer open source projects are embracing "Open Core" licensing model, where key parts of the software are restricted under a proprietary license. This model is deceiving and worse than a fully proprietary licensing model. This talk discusses the threats of open core model and how to successfully build a fully free commercial software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has become a trend to start as fully open source project until it reaches a critical mass adoption and then switch to a partially proprietary model. Typically, management user interface or some high-end features are restricted to commercial customers. Open source community is treated like a bunch of hackers and hobbyists. There isn't a really good reason to adopt open core model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary vs Open Core vs Open Source vs Free Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to commercialize Free software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get venture funding and still stay Open source?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact of GNU (A)GPL vs Apache License for commercial software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of work has been done already, many IT departments in public administrations continue to struggle with these topics. Based on my experience as former head of the team responsible for the implantation of the European Commission's IDBAC programme and my current contacts as OpenForum Academy fellow, I will discuss the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Public procurement, IT architecture, interoperability and the use of standards
- The European public procurement legislation and the use of open source software and the acquisition of open source software related services
- The European legislation on standards and the problems this causes for open source developers, software architects and software procurers
- The construction of custom software paid for by public funds and the 4 freedoms
- Sharing, re-use and co-development of custom software by public administrations; the European Union Public License and its relationship to other open source licenses
- How can public servants be active in existing open source communities
- How to convince the IT service providers to offer to public administrations solutions based on open source software
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On each of the topics, interaction with and feedback from the audience will be sought.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Software Patents After Alice: A Long and Sad Tail</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The United States Supreme Court's ruling in the landmark Alice vs. CLS Bank case has finally given the lower courts some tools to overturn vague and poorly written software patents. Larger companies may see fewer lawsuits in the short-term, but we're far from finished. Smaller companies are still at risk and bad actors could use international trade agreements to stop or roll-back recent gains.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last year's been very interesting for those of us who have been looking on in horror over the last decade as billions of dollars was spent on frivolous and ridiculously broad software patent litigation. The United States Supreme Court's ruling in the landmark Alice vs. CLS Bank case has finally given the lower courts some tools they could use to overturn obvious and vague patents. Many judges have found for the defendant and overturned obvious patents. For entities with the time and money to fight bad patents in court, this is fantastic news. As many as four out of five of the software patents on the books in the US might be found invalid under the new doctrines. For everyone else, this is a mixed bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still several things we need to pay attention to. Patent suits can still be brought. For entities that can't afford to fight, those disputes will be settled out of court -- without the full impact of the court's updated scope of patentability. Without legislation, it will take twenty years to cycle out the old style of broadly written patents. So, even if the United States Patent and Trade Office fixes their processes immediately we will still have a very long tail to contend with. The new scope of patentability hasn't been fully tested and there may yet turn out to be gaping loopholes that bad actors may use to undo the progress that has been made. Finally, global entities may use international trade agreements to stop or roll-back the progress made against poorly conceived patents in any country that has signed a sweeping treaty with patent language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we aren't done yet. The best way to keep moving forward is for the global community to work together. This talk is for anyone who is wondering what the recent decisions mean for small and mid-size entities, how international treaties can impact local policy and what can be done to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Copyleft has faced serious challenges in the last five years. It's not over: many more threats are on the way. Not by coincidence these attacks on copyleft come when "Open Source" reaches new heights of success. For example, hordes of software developers are funded full time to churn out new Free Software, as long as it's not copylefted. Some such code is specifically designed to replace existing, widely used, copylefted programs.
Meanwhile, programs under copyleft licenses (most notably the kernel named Linux) face a decades long, ongoing myriad of license violations. Such violations include nefarious attempts by major companies to shirk their responsibilities under copyleft. The situation is undoubtedly bleak.
Those of us who care about software freedom need a plan. Copyleft once assured an equal playing field, but big companies work daily to tilt the playing field in their favor and against the interests of most developers, hobbyists, users, and enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Copyleft, and the GNU General Public License (GPL) in particular, have faced serious challenges in the last five years. It's not over: many more threats are on the way. Not by coincidence these attacks on copyleft come when "Open Source" seems to reach new heights of success. For example, hordes of software developers are funded full time to churn out wonderful new Free Software, but their employers make one key requirement: develop Free Software only under non-copyleft licenses. Some of this new code is specifically designed to replace existing, widely used, copylefted programs and packages.
Meanwhile, those programs that remain under copyleft licenses (most notably the kernel named Linux) face a decades long, ongoing myriad of license violations. Such violations, most frighteningly, include nefarious attempts by major companies to shirk their responsibilities under copyleft. The situation is undoubtedly bleak.
Those of us who care about software freedom need a plan. Up until now, copyleft assured an equal playing field, but big companies work daily to tilt the playing field in their favor -- directly against the interests of most developers, hobbyists, users, and enthusiasts. This talk will present the political challenges that copyleft continues to face, and offer real actions that individuals can do to assure software freedom for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Who controls your project? Governance in the real world</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many FOSS projects have a carefully designed governance. But to which extent that governance fits the real inner life of the project? In this talk I will present some ways of measuring to which extent governance may be subverted (or not) by real practices, how that can be detected, and tracked. From this base, I will show how a continuous tracking of those behaviors can contribute to a more fair development community, and to increase the trust in the project. The discussion will be framed by the concept of "open development analytics".&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many FOSS projects have developed governance rules. Specially when companies are involved, those rules model the ethos of the project. They may try to avoid, for example, that a single company controls the main aspects of the development process. Or that independent developers are treated equal than those employed by companies. Or that the "old generation" doesn't have an overwhelming weight in decisions. Usually, those rules define governing bodies, how they are elected, and which binding rules those bodies may produce. Therefore, governance is enforced as a kind of "law" for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you have law, and you have reality. In the case of FOSS projects, you have bylaws, governing bodies, approved codes... and then you have tools, development practices, and developers. The fact that most of the development actions are mediated by tools allows for the examination of what is happening in the project. From there, you can learn to which extent that conforms with the governance envisioned. In other words, tools can be examined, to see to which extent the reality of the project fits what the project wanted them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will show how using simple software development analytics some specific areas can be analyzed from this point of view. For example, a good proxy for who soft-controls a project is who is contributing to it (authoring code, reviewing code, closing tickets, participating in discussions). A good proxy to how fair it is to developers is how they are treated in the code review process when they propose changes. And that way, several metrics can be defined to help understand what is really going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this will be framed using the concept of "open development analytics". Open development analytics can be understood as a step forward in project transparency and community openness. They can be used to provide useful about how the project is really behaving, so that anyone can detect problems and deviations from the intended behavior. I will explain how this makes the project more resilient, its supporting community more self-aware, and helps increase trust by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;James Shubin (@purpleidea) will be presenting his review of some of the important legal and licensing issues faced by commercial ventures and enterprises who are involved with or are (in particular) producing software.
James will discuss:
* Advantages and disadvantages to copyleft and permissive licenses
* The business cost of some of the different licenses
* Differences between license versions as it pertains to commercial ventures (eg: ALv2 vs. GPLv2 vs. GPLv3)
* The use of "Newspeak" and "weasel words" in communication
* How to interpret the data about license usage
* Real world examples and repercussions of some of the business decisions
* And a review and rebuttal of some of the points brought up during previous FOSDEM legal dev room presentations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, what you need to know if you are embarking on almost any commercial enterprise, since there are many software and legal aspects involved these days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Open Source is being ruined and it’s all our fault</title>
        <subtitle>How we both help and hurt ourselves in open source and figure out how to ensure the best possible outcome.</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;From the zealots of the past to the entrepreneurs of today open source has changed how businesses, non-profits, and individuals run software. Over the past 10 years this has expanded into the realm of hardware both in design and manufacturing. In this talk we analyze how we both help and hurt ourselves and figure out how to ensure the best possible outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Free / Libre Software (aka “Open Source”) has become a functional necessity of most 21st century businesses. The promise of “free” software has lead to rapid adoption of new technology and revolutionized past development processes and spurred entirely new models of businesses. The reality is that open source “realpolitik” is now the norm leaving much of the founding ideologies in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do businesses care about these ideological concerns? Are they used as a marketing/recruiting tool? Can/should the enterprise crowd take a stance on these issues? The focus becomes blurred as one compares software and hardware focused companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we analyze how “Open Source” businesses make money, how they benefit their users, and look at the pragmatic challenges ubiquitous to libre software, open hardware, and selling “support” as a model. In an audience friendly to open source we should be able to look in the mirror and ensure that we aren’t hurting ourselves, our businesses in the pursuit of making a living with the projects we love with the goal being to provide the audience with the insight and information to ask tough questions of each other and be prepared to be happy with the discussion as much as the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this talk is to share with the audience the interesting clock handling technology in GStreamer and how one pipeline's clock can slave from an other pipeline's clock, even in an other device over the network. This opens a wide range of very interesting use cases, the one used as a demo during the talk would be playing music that follows you around your home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how the next generation video player can be expanded to create interactions with the content and the viewers. Most video player experiences are based on the original TV set metaphor and provide a passive viewing experience. We will review examples based on the Kaltura Player infrastructure and ideas on how video playback can change to engage users and create interactive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Solène Buet will detail how W3C TTML subtitles can be used with MPEG DASH streaming, and how it was tested with the EBU-TT-D standard (TTML-based).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Solène implemented EBU-TT-D subtitling with the dash.js reference player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solène will explain what TTML-based subtitles are, and how they can be retrieved from a MPEG DASH stream for rendering in the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will cover the process followed by a TTML-based subtitle: from its recovering, to its parsing and its displaying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will get an insight in the very hot topic of subtitling through streaming technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of multimedia is one which is slow and reluctant to adapt new technologies, regardless of how inefficient and inflexible older technologies are in comparison. Such has been the case with all common video, audio and container formats spread through the internet. Historically, the number one reason for this has been poor support by popular programs, like IE6 not supporting PNG files or the APNG vs MNG and in recent times GIF vs WEBM. There have however been exceptions to this, such as the lighting fast adaption of VP9 by Google, which was an achievement only possible after developing the format themselves and pushing support for it through the popular Chrome browser. Although some browsers were not as quick to follow this trend (as they had to include an additional library dependency) this demonstrated to the world of multimedia that it is indeed possible to quickly adapt new technologies as long as they're an order of magnitude better than the current solutions and, more importantly, support for such formats would have to be available through the browsers themselves as soon as major providers start publishing content and services using it. Since a large majority of current browsers like Chrome, Firefox and their derivatives already include libavcodec (a library from the FFmpeg project to provide decoding and encoding of various formats), support for new formats within the library itself even before having their specifications published could speed up adaption and reduce future work load.
This talk will explain both the politics behind doing this work, and will give a more technical description of what the Daala codec currently is, as well as discuss the challenges of implementing it in FFmpeg's libavcodec, and finally discuss where it stands right now as the future heir to the throne of open video formats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MediaConch is a project built upon MediaInfo that develops tools to test the conformance of audiovisual files to their associated specifications, to evaluate files against declared policies and to fix metadata in audiovisual files. MediaConch currently focuses on the formats of Matroska, FFV1, and LPCM as implemented by the audiovisual archiving community. Jérôme will present on the process and challenges in creating these tools, address the role of conformance in open media projects, and demonstrate the utility of the project and its components to other open media projects. Jérôme will also provide an update on the IETF working group focused on standardizing web video, including the FFV1 codec and Matroska wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;MediaConch is an extensible, open source software project consisting of an implementation checker, policy checker, reporter, and fixer that targets preservation-level audiovisual files (specifically Matroska, LPCM and FFV1 for use in archives, providing detailed and batch-level conformance checking via an adaptable and flexible application program interface accessible by the command line, a graphical user interface, or a web-based shell. MediaConch is currently being developed by the MediaArea team, notable for the creation of open source media checker software, MediaInfo. Furthermore, the MediaArea team is dedicated to the further development of the standardization of the Matroska and FFV1 formats to ensure their longevity as a recommended digital preservation file format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Upipe is a recent project, designed to build custom multimedia players, transcoders or streamers. The presenter will explain how the use of Upipe in OpenHeadend products enabled them with advanced video processing capabilities, and will highlight the features that make Upipe so adapted to these use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Upipe is a flexible dataflow framework. The framework organizes the processing of incoming data in buffers inside a pipeline of modules. It exposes core types for buffers and modules (called "pipes"), and the API for communication between pipes and between the application and pipes. This presentation will include examples of complex pipelines performing video processing, and detail the unique features of Upipe that make the lives of developers easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This application is aiming at providing terrestrial broadcasting signal (TV), on any mobile device by using a wireless network.
The proof of concept has been demonstrated, by developing a solution (server) based on an open source software, from which everyone can benefit and which runs on different operating systems (Linux, Windows) and hardware platforms (PC, Raspberry PI, Synology NAS). It makes use of an existing standard (SAT&gt;IP) to make the server visible and discovered by existing clients (Applications) running on Android or iOS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over-the-air (OTA) audio identification provides us means to recognise sounds even in noisy environments. Popular uses for OTA identification includes recognition of audio tracks, radio or television stations, advertisements in cinema theatres &amp;amp; malls, etc...&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will take a look at how an OTA identification system is like and go over its significant components one by one. We will understand the underlying physics and governing mathematical equations. We will also talk about open source software and libraries, methodologies, algorithms, and the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk, we will learn basics of how to build and develop a system for acoustic fingerprinting and matching a partial audio recording with an audio track or a real-time stream of audio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;i-score is an intermedia sequencer dedicated to interactive scenario authoring. Designed as a generic data sequencer, this open source software allows a remote dialog with various applications, such as Max, Pd, Live ... using show-control protocols like OSC to store and recall parameters value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded by the National French Research Agency project OSSIA, the 1.0 version of i-score proposes a graphical formalism to set precise temporal and conditional relationships between events that can be interactively triggered. The edition and the execution of several independant time layers offer an unique way to manage parameters automations being attended by tools to interpolate states or to draw your own curved breakpoint function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the result of continuous discussions between scientists, ingeneers and users, the presentation will be articulated around well known issues identified during the development of setups for show-control or interactives setups used in museographic situations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will involve a few techniques and tricks to reverse engineer multimedia applications, with focus on video decoding.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reverse engineering is simpler than it looks like: while it's true that there are so many different kinds of audio and video files, there are lots of ways to read them, and make them work with existing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this talk, we will discuss about the ethics, and the motivation behind reverse engineering, and why it is important. We will also analyze a few video technologies, as introduction, and explain the basic hacking techniques, with some practical cases from the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be surprised how most techniques do not require any particular tool, except, perhaps, a brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A brief look into the history and vision behind a web-based open-source operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the Summer of 2011, two engineers at Mozilla had just finished making a complete rendering engine for PDF files using JavaScript and HTML5 (https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/). Emboldened by this success, the question they kept asking themselves was "is there anything JavaScript can't do?" Somehow, the idea of building an entire phone operating in JavaScript got in their heads. So they decided to investigate how technically possible it was, and thus Boot to Gecko (later Firefox OS) was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I want to shed some light on the how Firefox OS came about, and how it developed over the last 5 years at Mozilla. This is not really a talk about the UX, or content design, or the marketing of Firefox OS, but rather about Mozilla's journey through the mobile OS landscape. I also hope to leave some time at the end to answer any questions people may have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Design for All versus Design for One and Adaptive User Interfaces</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) is an open-source infrastructure developed by Cloud4all and several other R&amp;amp;D projects that aims to support automatically adaptive user interfaces and thus enable "Design for One".&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Design for All strives to create user interfaces "for human diversity, social inclusion and equality" (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). In spite of its name, the goal of Design for All is not to create a single solution for everybody ("one size fits all"). However, most software comes with settings and options that need to be tweaked by the user, and most users never change a program's settings. Many users are unaware of the available settings, they are afraid of breaking something, etc. What is needed is software that adapts to the user's needs and preferences, so users don't need to worry about where to find the settings. Ideally, the user's needs and preferences should also be "translatable" to other systems, e.g. from a desktop PC to mobile devices, websites and ticket vending machines. The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) is an open-source infrastructure developed by Cloud4all and several other R&amp;amp;D projects that aims to support automatically adaptive user interfaces and thus enable "Design for One". However, even this approach assumes that interfaces have accessibility features (though not necessarily enabled by default), so it does not make Design for All redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended as an introduction to a more technical talk about GPII in the same devroom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure aims to deliver a cross-platform solution that can improve significantly the way we actually interact with computers and other devices such as smartphones, ATMs or any general public access devices. During this session, we will describe the state of the art of the GPII, what's in progress and future works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the outcome of the recently finished EU funded project Cloud4all, many pieces of the GPII have been built in order to demonstrate the concept of the GPII and how it would work in the future. As a result, we've integrated the GPII on both GNU/Linux and MS Windows platforms, and we have also created an infrastructure to perform a full layered adaptation of such platforms and in order to drastically decrease the time that people with disabilities can spend on configuring the system when they start using a new computer or interacting with a public device. During this session we will focus on describing:
* How the GPII runs on different and supported platforms
* How the GPII makes the auto-personalization of the system at different levels
* How third-party ATs, software such as web browsers, cloud-based ATs or even web sites can make use of the auto-personalization features of the GPII
* Current limitations
* Ongoing work&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;All users should be able to use all applications, despite any kind of condition (blindness, colorblindness, deafness, ...). Without accessibility, software excludes the people who can not use them. I will introduce accessibility, the accessibility stack, and the good practices to keep in mind while designing applications so they get accessible &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;All users should be able to use all applications, despite any kind of condition (blindness, colorblindness, deafness, ...). Without accessibility, software excludes the people who can not use them. Fixing the accessibility of an application after having developped it can be quite costly, while designing applications with accessibility in mind from the start does not cost much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, for a fair part, accessibility in design boils down to well-known good practice, such as structuring the application logically without any particular rendering in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will introduce to accessibility, the accessibility stack, and the good practices to keep in mind while designing applications so they get accessible &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming up with logos can be an exhausting process sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you get paper and pencil ready or dive directly into Illustrator? Before going neck deep into your logo project, check out following thumb rules to keep in mind when working on your logo. You will be learning about basic color theory, cliches and metaphors specifically guiding you in your logo endeavours. Some of these tips can be generally applied to most logo projects, while some others might suit the needs of different logos.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session we will show how to build a simple, cheap and portable testing lab to run and capture usability studies with mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 we decided that recording usability tests for mobile devices was too hard and too expensive, and that logistical issues were preventing people from running sorely needed usability studies for their mobile software. The outcome of that was crappy mobile software all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had to be a better way, so we set to find it. And find it we did. We called it "Do it yourself mobile usability testing", we released it under a Creative Commons License, and has been doing the rounds in design circuits ever since. We have showed it at EuroIA, the IA Summit, South by Southwest Interactive, Mozfest, UX Spain, UX Sofia, UXLX ... we can't even remember all of them. We now want to show it at FOSDEM, and do justice to the open nature of the project from its inception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session will skip the theory bits (20 minutes is not enough), but it will include a brief review of the most common capture approaches for mobile usability studies. Then we build the usability lab in front of you, so that you can see how easy it is, how cheap ... and how fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the phrase 'We mean design in the broadest sense' on opensourcedesign.net, this talk will discuss what are the opportunities and barriers of introducing open source mentality and workflow in domains of design that aren't software related. Engineering, architecture, even print and product design can all benefit from the open source way as born and developed in the software world. The current state, the arguments that can counter the common reservations and the possible barriers for introducing open source in a design shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the talk will be on the Engineering and Architectural design which have the most potential for an effective introduction to open source workflows and publication of final works. The relationship with the clients, equipment manufacturers and the state, the nature of the most common projects and the current mentality of professionals all play their role in the success or failure of an open source model of work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;User research, user centred design and open source technologies are central to building services that meet GDS's standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User research, user centred design and open source technologies are central to building services that meet GDS's standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the if a member of the public has some research or design input, they themselves are unable to commit a change to it, it's not possible for them to get their "patches" seen, or it is very rare. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will be an overview of some projects I've worked on showing how user research and design is done in the open, how we try to open source our work where possible, and why we don't when it is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session will ask the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this really open source?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could that be improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenEmbedded is an embedded Linux build system, a wickedly complicated tool for engineers to create heavily customised Linux distributions for small computers. OpenEmbedded tools have always been text-based: their users are masters of the command line, and have trained their brains to extract knowledge from large blobs of raw text data. How did an interaction designer end up becoming an OpenEmbedded contributor?&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Teams working across disciplines often suffer from misunderstandings, which creates tension. Let’s look at ways we can better understand each other to create products that users love.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What do designers do? What can they bring to a project, and when should you bring them in?
Designers and developers don’t always have the easiest working relationship. But working together, we can make awesome products and services.
How can we work together to produce work everyone is proud of? Which project set-ups work best and which tools can we use to help each other? In the end, it’s our users who will win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Designer's compromises in Open Source</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Open Source Design</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We might need a designer to provide a clear vision and solve everything we couldn't agree upon. Also the designer might expect to be warmly welcomed inside Open Source projects, but the reality can be a bit different. We always have expectations on how the designer - community interaction should be, but in order to have a successful collaboration we need compromises, sometimes from the designer's part, other times from the community members.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If we were to ask someone if Open Source communities need designers, the answer would be 'YES'. But do we know what it means to have a designer among us? What will he do? For how long? How true can he stay to his predefined design process? Are all the design stages relevant in Open Source? How open the artefacts he creates need to be? With what type of tools?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have an image in our head about the type of designer we need for our community, but how much of that image corresponds to our real needs and with the designer's reality and expectations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to integrate in an Open Source community, a designer might need to revoke his design 'purity' and make some compromises, like doing a bit of development for example. Does working in a free or open environment mean that the work needs to follow the same rules? What is preferred: creativity or consistency? Does the designer have the final decision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in an utopian environment doesn't mean that we don't do compromises. So, how much do we compromise?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Designers in an open source community or environment are not easy; neither for the designer, neither for those working with her/him.
Open Source and Free Software communities have an alternative work and collaboration culture compared to classic working environments.
In this talk, we can learn though how to add transparency to our workflow, and praise "sharing is caring" more than "made by me".&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Designers in an open source community or environment are not easy; neither for the designer, neither for those working with her/him.
Open Source and Free Software communities have an alternative work and collaboration culture compared to classic working environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, designers have taken a more and more important role in such communities, originally initiated by developers and programmers. Just think of the Firefox logo, how important it is to such a big movement and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, designers are difficult beings; we often can't get over our ego, are perfectionists in unneeded ways and often, like magicians, don't want to share our materials or tricks. That's why it's often hard for a designer to work "in the open".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can learn though how to add transparency to our workflow, and praise "sharing is caring" more than "made by me".
Licenses like Creative Commons, Open Document Formats and similar. are the most powerful tools of a designer in an open source community. We are able to become better designers, and better contributors at the same time, following a few simple principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with several design universities now to get the students involved and working on open source projects. Especially for usability testing this is very little investment with a huge benefit for the project, professors and the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll present the collaborations I did so far and how we can push it forward more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"How can I contribute?" is a panel discussion for everyone who works in "design" (visual designers, graphic designers, interaction designers, researchers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion panel is for people like me: people who use open source software daily, who promote open source software to others, and who want to contribute to open source projects but aren't sure where to start. The panel will be made up of designers, researchers, and developers who are already working in open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal will be to give the audience some beginning steps to make a start in contributing to OSS projects. The panel will begin the discussion, and the objective will be to take questions from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to identify what project(s) you want to contribute to (What are you interested in?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to find open source projects (Github, Sourceforge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make the first connection with a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make your first contribution&lt;/li&gt;

        <subtitle>development status</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gnucap, the GNU circuit analysis package, is a flexible mixed-signal circuit simulator with significant technical advantages over SPICE derivatives. This talk is about development and usability status of the core and several derived works of the last years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gnucap consists of a core library and plugins. The core library is primarily the work of Albert Davis, who has started his project well over 30 years ago. This talk will outline the meaning of an experimental fork, Gnucap-uf, which has evolved from work at the university of Frankfurt. Gnucap-uf mostly adds research specific features, relying on ad-hoc changes to the kernel and interfaces. For example, state space inspection and ageing simulation functionality has been added without sticking to the intended data structures. Beyond that, several extensions written for this fork still (could (easily made to)) work with the original project. This talk will address three of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"gnucap-adms" is a verilog model compiler based on admsXml, which has been written with focus and intent on simple academic proof-of-concept examples. After some extra work and cleanup, it is now possible to (partly) translate bsim6 compact models into functional plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"gnucap-geda" (formerly lang_gschem) was meant to turn Gnucap into the intended schematic translation and exchange platform.
Specifically, as a GSoC project (2012), a language plugin targetting the gEDA schematic format has been implemented, demonstrating the conversion from schematics first into the internal data format and second into another language such as verilog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"gnucap-qucs" is a project that implements a Gnucap based replacement for "qucsator", the simulator used by QUCS, a graphical user frontend to circuit simulation. Qucsator implements several component models and commands, which must be provided by extensions for Gnucap. Some of these do now exist. The corresponding language plugin enables the processing of qucsator input files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>EDA</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk presents Qucs (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator) features, the current status of development and the project roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator. The graphical user interface (GUI) is used for schematic capture and visualization of simulation results. It can simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behavior of the circuit. The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types such as DC, AC, transient, S-parameter, noise analysis, harmonic balance analysis. Digital simulation and circuit optimization are integrated into the GUI and powered by other open-source tools (Icarus-Verilog, freeHDL, ASCO). Besides the library of components it also includes tools for the design of active and passive filters, transmission lines, attenuators and matching circuits. Interfaces for Matlab/Octave and Python are also available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will provide an overview of the features and available tools along with a selection of examples. It will present the latest developments including: ongoing migration towards the latest Qt framework; new features related to the “turn-key” Verilog-A (ADMS) model compiler as well as support for other simulation engines (Ngspice, Xyce).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Based on Migen, MiSoC is a library of cores and a system-on-chip integration system to build gateware for various applications. MiSoC is lightweight (runs on FPGA devices as small as Spartan-6 LX9 with 32-bit RISC CPU and SDRAM), portable (demonstrated on Xilinx, Altera and Lattice devices) and high performance (e.g. contains the fastest open source DDR3 solution we are aware of). Designing and integrating cores is facilitated by Python and Migen features. Current MiSoC applications include LTE base stations, video processing (Numato Opsis) and experiment control system (ARTIQ).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays there are many open source tools that are able to simulate either VHDL or (System)Verilog but none of them has the goal to address the problem of a mixed language simulation, that is, a simulation that involves more than one language at a time.
In fact, people can not use multiple hardware-description languages in a design unless they rely on a proprietary solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an introduction about compilers and simulators, the focus will move to review potential problems and solutions for the design and the implementation of an event-based digital mixed-language simulator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yosys (Yosys Open Synthesis Suite) is an Open Source Verilog synthesis and verification tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project IceStorm aims at reverse engineering and documenting the bit-stream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bit-stream files, including a tool that converts iCE40 bit-stream files into behavioral Verilog. Currently the bitstream format for iCE40 HX1K and HX8K is fully documented and supported by the tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arachne-PNR is an Open Source place&amp;amp;route tool for iCE40 FPGAs based on the databases provided by Project IceStorm. It converts BLIF files into an ASCII file format that can be turned into a bit-stream by IceStorm tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three projects together implement a complete open source tool-chain for iCE40 FPGAs. It is available now and it is feature complete (with the exception of timing analysis, which is work in progress).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PCBmodE is an open source PCB design tool written in Python. In practice, PCBmodE is run in commandline to convert JSON files to SVG, extract changes from an edited SVG, and generate Gerbers and drill files from the SVG. Graphical editing is done in Inkscape, though much of the design is defined in the primary JSON files edited in a text editor. It doesn't currently have a notion of schematics or DRC.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;All about NPLN. What it is, what are the aims, what is the current status.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first Electronic Design Automation (EDA) devroom in 2015
at FOSDEM has been a great success.  Since then I had been
working on NPLN, my personal pet project to help me and others
collecting and computing the info we already have about OSHW
Boards, Circuits, and their models (eg Spice, IBIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I had been digging in techniques from the eighties to
find errors and compute hand-outs for repairing. And yes,
I like Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So NPLN currently is a mixture of a webcrawler, of spicelib
and edacore, and ramps it up to Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share my work since last FOSDEM with you, and I hope
for your feedback and ideas, as well as spreading the word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A proposal for data interchange between EDA tools</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>EDA</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I will present a system for data interchange based on the structural subset of Verilog, extending the usage to express the additional data for layout and schematics.  This is an intermediate format to provide a common point for interchange between tools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;More detail is available at http://gnucap.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=gnucap:user:netlist&lt;em&gt;import&lt;/em&gt;and_export&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent is to use this intermediate format to provide convenient data interchange, including bi-directional interchange between incompatible competing tools, for example between Kicad and gEDA.  It also eventually should enable things we don't have yet in free EDA, such as post-layout simulation, and schematic vs layout verification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many EDA tools are burdened by their own legacy. They started out decades ago and have been 'patched' along without a complete re-think of development methodologies and new views of usability. In this short talk I'll discuss some ideas about how that could change through (possible) emerging interests in what we do.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A look at how the various communities and projects can collaborate to achieve common goals, and reflections on how this can fit with the life-cycle of our mature open-source EDA packages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A look at how the various communities and projects can collaborate to achieve common goals - despite their differing design choices seemingly being etched in tablets of stone (should that be layers of copper clad FR4?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will aim to address some of the dynamics between project developers and their communities, reflecting on lessons I've learnt within the gEDA project - and on some of the challenges brought by working more closely with those who might be viewed as our "competition".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will propose some areas I see as low-hanging fruit for potential collaboration - and some problems to be overcome on the way. There should also be opportunity to explore some more controversial ideas on project re-factoring, drawing upon aspects of last year's EdaCore proposal, and my thoughts on how a common underlying library might be used to bring about the start of project convergence without losing the individual identities and design goals of the projects involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the audience is receptive (or argumentative!), a decent Q&amp;amp;A session would be welcome here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ada-Belgium and Ada-Europe are non-profit organizations set up to promote the use of the Ada programming language and related technology, and to disseminate knowledge and experience into academia, research and industry in Belgium and Europe, resp. Ada-Europe has member-organizations, such as Ada-Belgium, in various countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information on this DevRoom is available on the Ada-Belgium web-site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An overview of the main features of the Ada language, with special emphasis on those features that make it especially attractive for free software development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ada is a feature-rich language, but what really makes Ada stand-out is that the features are nicely integrated towards serving the goals of software engineering. If you prefer to spend your time on designing elegant solutions rather than on low-level debugging, if you think that software should not fail, if you like to build programs from readily available components that you can trust, you should really consider Ada!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I present my experiences of adopting the maintenance of Whitaker's Words, a Latin dictionary written in Ada by Col William Whitaker, who was deeply involved in the creation of Ada itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be the perspective of someone from outside the Ada community who found he really liked the language, and the challenges I faced learning Ada from online materials, converting the Words source code to more idiomatic (post Ada-83) forms, adopting the tooling, accessing community support, finding collaborators, making Ada play nicely with the Web, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitaker's Words may be one of the most widely-used pieces of Ada software, and a quick Twitter search suggests it plays a key role in helping students cheat on their Latin translation homework. As a linguist and hacker, what really interests me is the use of Ada's type system to encode Latin's grammar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ada Doom 3 is an open source project created as both an experiment and as a serious attempt at making a Windows game engine capable of fully rendering Doom 3 assets.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Engineering a complete OS media layer and 3D engine that facilitates multiple platforms presents many unique challenges. These challenges and solutions will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also cover how Ada aided in the process of reverse engineering the half million line Doom 3 BFG (Id Tech 4 BFG) code base and how its typing system helped steer the development of Ada Doom 3 to its current state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Consider the organization of parallel heterogeneous computations. The sequential version runs in two stages: the first stage produces jobs that can be computed independently from each other in the second stage. The producer in the first stage is executed by one task, while the other tasks compute the jobs from the second stage, as the jobs are managed by a queue, implemented by a thread safe package.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This design will be illustrated with an application that involves the refactoring of code in the free and open source package PHCpack, a package to solve polynomial systems by polynomial homotopy continuation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Eurocontrol Flow Management System provides a simulation functionality to evaluate air traffic flow management measures (such as delay assignments or reroutings) before applying them operationally. This implies to upload a day worth of traffic in a simulation environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe various techniques and tools used to optimize the simulation startup time, and will discuss the gains reached via micro-optimization (among others using Valgrind) or via macro-optimization (such as using parallelism features of Ada).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The GNAT GPL 2015 release by AdaCore includes a cross-compiler for a new platform: Raspberry Pi 2. We have used this platform to drive and control a real model train in Ada. SPARK was used to prove absence of collisions. I will present the hardware part as well as the software part, and show a video of the model train in action.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic memory management has always been a source of trouble, and garbage collection is just a way to overcome the lack of proper memory management in many languages. This presentation shows how Ada addresses this issue in several original ways: first by requiring much less dynamic memory than other languages, and then by providing powerful tools for controlling allocation and deallocation when it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>A distributed control system for the Internet of Things</title>
        <subtitle>Alidron</subtitle>
        <track>IoT</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Making many devices discover and interact with each other is the big challenge ahead of the IoT. Companies are already eager to make their solutions be the common denominator of all your devices, usually based on their central cloud. Alidron project aims at finding a different approach based on features seen in industrial control systems, with a distributed twist while keeping a fuzzy limit between edge computing and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Control systems are software usually seen running large industrial, infrastructure and research equipment. They boast certain capabilities like aggregating and distributing data from and to hardware, generating alarms and events based on these data, maintaining the configuration between the data-channels and the real hardware sources, archiving these data, offering integrated diagnostic tools, and providing a consistent view of the monitored processes in a user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's solution for control systems are not a close match for the Internet of Things. They are based on a master-slave pattern where devices can't take much decision by cooperating with other devices. All interactions between devices have to happen within a predefined framework of features the provider thought of, which are usually lagging behind the fast-moving IT world by many years, if not decades...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alidron is an attempt at mixing concepts from control systems with ubiquitous computing and becomes an Ambient Intelligence platform. Its first demonstration is using it for smart home behaviours. Firstly, it links devices with other devices as well as with control programs. Some of these control programs are actually used for learning home users habits and learn how to become proactive for them. It allows these nodes to run indifferently on devices, on a local computer or in a cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>IoT</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of devices in IoT space are constrained devices. A lot recent developments and standard initiatives have addressed connectivity solutions for constrained devices by introducing protocols such as CoAP and MQTT. With connectivity in place, the next challenge is how these devices can make use of the existing Web services. This talk introduces the web service interface (WSI) layer in IoTivity framework to address this challenge. A demo on how IoT devices can seamlessly access cloud Services with the helps of WSI in IoTivity stack will be given.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Web services have been one of the latest technological changes that are revolutionizing the world of business and our everyday lives. With the huge expanding of Things in the IoT world, the vision of accessing web services is not only for smart device any more. The existences of trillions of constraied devices brings  great challenges and possibly opportunities of  seamless interoperability with existing web services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will discuss the technical challenges from various aspects. A general review of existing solutions in industry and proposals/initiatives in research and standard will be given. To introduce the appoach used in IoTivity, we first give a detailed background introduction on IoTivity framework. Based on this we will discuss that with some of the most compelling applications in the IoT space involve rich and differentiated interactions between people and devices, a interface layer is required to provide features to help web service developers to introduce and tailor their service to the IoT context. This talk is supported by a demo on how IoT devices can seamlessly access cloud Services with the helps of web service interface layer in IoTivity stack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>How to defragment your IoT vendor silos and securely decentralise your data via Matrix.</subtitle>
        <track>IoT</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session we will focus on gathering, processing &amp;amp; visualising data from various IoT and human sources, reviewing the various technologies available to unify the data whilst providing a deep dive into the Matrix.org decentralised data ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an introduction to the problem space and available solutions, we will focus on introducing Matrix's architecture and its open source, Apache-licensed reference client and server implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This session will show how to actually build an entirely open and dentralised IoT platform using open source software. Together we will start from scratch, check-out the code and first get a Matrix webclient running. We will use this as a dashboard to collate and visualise data from a variety of connected devices and services, federated together in an open ecosystem via Matrix.  We will then add services on top to further aggregate, process and route the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also discuss exactly how you could extend the platform for advanced features and for your own specific needs. We will look at some examples (wearable computing, drone control/telemetry/video, robotics) that we and the community have implemented during various hackathons and projects - and show how IoT data may be bridged into non-IoT communication platforms such as IRC or Slack via Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>IoT</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When everything is connected we can question what programming approach is most suitable. Programming interconnected systems shows similarities to programming for multiple processors. However, programming for multiple processors is a challenging task. We propose and demonstrate an easy framework based on lessons learned from programming for IoT scenarios which shows potential for programming multiple processors as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Approaches to program concurrently require a thorough understanding of the computer. Not all people who program possess this. However, as processors are not getting faster, everybody will need to program concurrently eventually. One of the main challenges of programming for multiple processors is the fact that it is often approached from a sequential programming perspective. When dealing with IoT it is usual to send and receive messages thus this becomes the paradigm. This paradigm is one of interacting entities passing messages rather than parsing logic sequentially. Based on these hypothesis we have researched an easy framework to program for multiple processors as well as devices connected through the network. We have tested the proposed framework on a group of Creative Coders which showed it is regarded easier than classical programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework is based on the ZOCP protocol build upon ZeroMQ which was demonstrated last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Offline experiences are enabling more unique user experiences to naturally happen without requiring an Internet connection.  From IoT devices like beacons to Mobile applications, we will go over why offline is a requirement for success and how we can create that experience by using an embedded JSON database for local storage to replicate data to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Offline experiences are enabling more unique user experiences to naturally happen without requiring an Internet connection.  From IoT devices like beacons to Mobile applications, we will go over why offline is a requirement for success and how we can create that experience by using an embedded JSON database for local storage to replicate data to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the digital transformation in today’s always-connected world, users expect to have a mobile experience that is immediate, pervasive, and aware. In this way, it is crucial to build apps that meet these expectations. Specifically, it’s building mobile apps that are always available, regardless of network connectivity and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, you will learn what it takes how to build an embedded and mobile solution that has a consistent user experience, both online and offline. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Beacons &amp;amp; Mobile solutions &amp;amp; demo
• Syncing the data
• Storing the data
• Securing the data
• Cross platform data modeling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will walk away with an understanding of the design patterns required to build an app that works online and offline using a NoSQL backend – all this, through a BlueTooth Beacons and using open source technologies to sync, store and secure your data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will talk about porting Smart.JS, an open-source JavaScript-based IoT platform, to two very different hardware platforms: Espressif ESP8266 and TI CC3200, the difficulties we encountered and lessons that we learned working with them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will describe the Smart.JS platform (focusing on parts other than the V7 Javascript interpreter itself, which is the focus of another talk), and give the audience a taste of the embedded development process for two different platforms: one from an established player in the field and an up-and-coming recent entrant, very popular with enthusiasts. We will discuss the hardware, the SDK and the developer interactions, the challenges that we had with each of them and how we tackled them in each case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;IoT.js is a platform for IoT applications written in JavaScript. With IoT.js developers can create IoT services that communicate with each other and the outside world.
IoT.js is a lightweight version of Node.js and designed to bring the success of Node.js to small IoT devices like lamps, thermometers, switches and sensors. This class of devices tends to use resource-constrained microcontrollers which are too small to fit a full Node.js stack.
In order to meet those constraints, IoT.js runs on top of JerryScript which is a lightweight JavaScript engine running on platforms with less than 64KB of RAM and less than 200KB of flash memory. Despite the low footprint, JerryScript is a full-featured JavaScript engine implementing the entire ECMAScript 5.1 standard.
Both IoT.js and JerryScript are open source projects released under the Apache License.
The talk will include a demo running a Node.js module with IoT.js on a resource-constrained microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Usually IoT discussions focus either on the hardware for setting up the sensors and bridging devices or in the middleware for dealing with the data aggregation from the sensors. This misses the point that IoT is the realization of end-to-end machine interaction. In this talk I address this issue by showing how to approach IoT end-to-end using free software. We'll pick and choose from many projects out there, some of them apparently unrelated to more "traditional" IoT approaches are revealed to be fundamental for a scalable IoT implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Lepton a FOSS OS for IoT</title>
        <subtitle>a POSIX RTOS for tiny and small devices</subtitle>
        <track>IoT</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lepton/Tauon is an open source POSIX "compliant" operating system (OS) for
deeply embedded devices. It tries to bring PSE-53 POSIX capabilities to emdedded
world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lepton is an POSIX operation system that targets deeply embedded system and platform like cortex-M.
Lightweight is greek translation of lepton. It brings modularity and "application" process
development for limited resources system (few hundred of Kio FLASH and few dozens of Kio RAM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project is not to develop an another operating system like GNU/Linux but
an human undestandable OS that provides more services than a realtime kernel, while keeeping
a reasonable footprint for deeply embedded system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lepton eases portability of UNIX-like programs and libraries with providing a POSIX layer
that gives application programer most common syscalls like vfork and exec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lepton is not only a POSIX layer, it takes some concepts from UNIX "philosophy":
  - Modularity and reusability
  - Everything is file. Everything is a stream of bytes.
  - Standard input/output&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact more than 150 functions of POSIX standard are available for :
  - process and thread creation/synchronisation
  - standard peripherals abstraction layer like Linux kernel modules
  - UNIX stream mechanism.
  - network support though LWIP or uIP from contiki.
  - VFS virtual file system layer to add any type of file system (FAT, YAFFS ...).
  - gui libraries (nanoX and FLNX)
  - network standard services like webserver and FTP server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lepton is already use in industrial products like oscilloscopes and electrical installation
testers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some demonstrations will be showed with AT91SAMD20 (cortex-M0+) and STM32-nucleo (cortex-M4).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>WPANKit - A Linux based Open-Source 6LoWPAN IoT BSP</subtitle>
        <track>IoT</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The WPANKit is a ptxdist based Open-Source 6LoWPAN Board Support Package (BSP). The main focus is to provide a software development kit for the linux-wpan project. The linux-wpan project aims to implement a 6LoWPAN inside the mainline Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the WPANKit: An Open-Source Linux BSP to develop 6LoWPAN IoT applications. It contains support for various common platforms such Raspberry Pi's and Beaglebones. Additional components like the openlabs 802.15.4 transceiver SPI transceiver or BTLE USB dongles gives you a getting started platform into the Linux 6LoWPAN world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WPANKit will directly build a current mainline 6LoWPAN kernel, which is the official bluetooth-next tree. This is important, because the mainline 6LoWPAN development is still much in development. Additional the WPANKit offers a large of userspace IoT software collection e.g. tshark for sniffing network traffic, libcoap, etc. On top of this BSP you can develop your IoT application, setting up a Border-Router or help at the current mainline 6LoWPAN Linux-kernel development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the power of ptxdist you can easily add new own packages for cross-compiling. As well we accept patches to integrate new software into the official WPANKit repository, so we getting more and more new IoT capable software into the WPANKit which can be used by other ptxdist users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Several sources of data consist of events representing relationships between entities, like user interactions in a social network, clicks on pages linking to each other, purchases of products on web stores, etc. These streams of real-time data can be represented as dynamic graphs, where each event adds or updates an edge in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing dynamic graphs is a challenging task that requires sophisticated state management, snapshotting mechanisms, and incremental graph algorithms. Luckily, several graph computations, like graph statistics, aggregates, and graph sketches, as well as more complex algorithms like connected components and bipartiteness detection, can be computed in a single-pass fashion. Single-pass algorithms process each edge once and do not need to store or access the complete graph state.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will give an overview of the Apache Flink streaming API and show how we can leverage it for building graph streaming applications. We will show how to implement single-pass graph aggregations and single-pass graph algorithms, like connected components and bipartiteness detection. Finally, we will give a preview of a work-in-progress graph streaming API, which we are building on top of Flink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We want to present the openCypher project, whose purpose is to make Cypher available to everyone – every data store, every tooling provider, every application developer. openCypher is a continual work in progress. Over the next few months, we will move more and more of the language artifacts over to GitHub to make it available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;openCypher is an open source project that delivers four key artifacts released under a permissive license:
(i) the Cypher reference documentation, (ii) a Technology compatibility kit (TCK), (iii) Reference implementation (a fully functional implementation of key parts of the stack needed to support Cypher inside a data platform or tool) and (iv) the Cypher language specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also seeking to make the process of specifying and evolving the Cypher query language as open as possible, and are actively seeking comments and suggestions on how to improve the Cypher query language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to provide more details regarding the above-mentioned aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to present the openCypher project, whose purpose is to make Cypher available to everyone – every data store, every tooling provider, every application developer. openCypher is a continual work in progress. Over the next few months, we will move more and more of the language artifacts over to GitHub to make it available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;openCypher is an open source project that delivers four key artifacts released under a permissive license:
(i) the Cypher reference documentation, (ii) a Technology compatibility kit (TCK), (iii) Reference implementation (a fully functional implementation of key parts of the stack needed to support Cypher inside a data platform or tool) and (iv) the Cypher language specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also seeking to make the process of specifying and evolving the Cypher query language as open as possible, and are actively seeking comments and suggestions on how to improve the Cypher query language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to provide more details regarding the above-mentioned aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/"&gt;Bruno Latour&lt;/a&gt; wrote a book about philosophy (an inquiry into modes of existence). He decided that the &lt;a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/252"&gt;paper book&lt;/a&gt; was no place for the numerous footnotes, documentation or glossary, instead
giving access to all this information surrounding the book through a &lt;a href="http://modesofexistence.org/"&gt;web application&lt;/a&gt; which would present itself as a reading companion.
He also offered to the community of readers to submit their contributions to his inquiry by writing new documents to be added to the platform.
The first version of our &lt;a href="https://github.com/medialab/aime-core"&gt;web application&lt;/a&gt; was built on PHP Yiii and MySQL on the server side. This soon proved to be a nightmare to maintain because of the ultra-relational nature of our data.
We refactored it completely to use node.js and Neo4J. We went from a tree system with internal links modelized inside a relational database to a graph of paragraphs included into documents, subchapters etc. all sharing links between them.
On the way, we've learned Neo4J thoroughly, from graph data modeling to cypher tricks and developped our custom cypher query graphical monitor using sigma.js in order to check our data trans-modeling consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this journey, we've stumbled upon data model questions : ordered links, sub items grouping necessity, data output constraints from Neo4J, and finally the limitations of Neo4J community edition.
Finally we feel much more confortable as developers in our new system. Reasoning about our data has become much easier and, moreover, our users are also happier since the platform's performance has never been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our intention is, therefore, to share our experience with the community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- our application's data needs
- our shift from a MySQL data model to a Neo4J graph model
- our feedbacks in using a graph database and more precisely Neo4J including our custom admin tool [Agent Smith](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/agent-smith)
- a very quick description of the admin tools we built to let the researchers write or modify contents (a markdown web editor)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I'll introduce &lt;a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow"&gt;differential dataflow&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source analytics platform, and describe how it enables fundamentally new approaches to large-scale graph processing. Specifically, we'll see how to fairly easily write and run standard graph analyses, whose output results are automatically updated as their inputs changed. On billion-edge graphs this approach can both be more efficient than platforms like GraphX &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; provide sub-second update times.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(stolen from https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differential dataflow is a data-parallel programming framework designed to efficiently process large volumes of data and to quickly respond to changes in input collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other data-parallel platforms, differential dataflow supports a variety of data-parallel operators such as group_by and join. Unlike most other data-parallel platforms, differential dataflow also includes an iterate operator, which repeatedly applies a differential dataflow subcomputation to a collection until it converges, especially useful in the context of graph processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have written a differential dataflow program, you then update the input collections and the implementation will respond with the correct updates to the output collections. These updates (both input and output) have the form (data, diff), where data is a typed record and diff is an integer indicating the change in the number of occurrences of data. A positive diff indicates more occurrences of data and a negative diff indicates fewer. If things are working correctly, you never see a zero diff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differential dataflow is efficient because it communicates only in terms of differences. At its core is a computational engine which is also based on differences, and which does no work that does not correspond to a change in the trace of the computation as a result of changes to the inputs. Achieving this property in the presence of iterative subcomputations is the main "unique" feature of differential dataflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Arabesque: A Distributed Graph Mining Platform</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Graph Processing</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Arabesque provides an elegant solution to the difficult problem of Graph Mining that lets a user easily express
graph mining algorithms and efficiently distribute the computation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed data processing platforms such as MapReduce and Pregel (Giraph, GraphLab, Graph-X) have substantially simplified the design and deployment of certain classes of distributed graph analytics algorithms such as computing Pagerank, SSP, CC etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these platforms do not represent a good match for graph mining problems, as for example finding frequent subgraphs(FSM) in a labeled graph or finding Cliques. Given an input graph, these problems require exploring a very large number of subgraphs (embeddings) and finding patterns that match some “interestingness” criteria desired by the user.  The number of the embeddings that the system needs to explore grows exponential to the size of the embeddings. For instance even for a tiny graph of ~4000 vertices, we can reach 1.7 Billion embeddings when we consider embeddings of size 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we present Arabesque the first distributed data processing platform for implementing graph mining algorithms. Arabesque automates the process of exploring a very large number of embeddings and defines a high-level computational model, Think Like an Embedding (TLE), which simplifies the development of scalable graph mining algorithms. Arabesque based applications require a handful of lines of code, scale to trillions of embeddings, and represent in some cases the first available distributed solutions. Arabesque runs on top of Giraph/Hadoop, but uses the TLE programming model instead of the TLV model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Gradoop: Scalable Graph Analytics with Apache Flink</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At the Leipzig University, we develop Gradoop [1], a framework for distributed,
declarative graph analytics on top of Apache Flink [2]. Gradoop is designed
around the so-called Extended Property Graph Model (EPGM) and supports
semantically rich, schema-free graph data. In this model, a database consists
of multiple property graphs, which we call logical graphs. These graphs are
application specific subsets from shared vertex and edge sets. The EPGM
provides operators for both single graphs as well as collections of graphs.
Operators may also return single graphs or graph collections thus enabling
the definition of analytical workflows in a declarative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I would like to give an overview of Gradoop, the EPGM and its
operators and show how Apache Flink helps us by presenting a subset of our
operator implementations. Furthermore, I will sketch the usefulness of Gradoop
by presenting an analytical use case from the business intelligence domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradoop is open-source and licenced under GPLv3. The Gradoop source code and
a short documentation can be found on GitHub [3], a more detailed explanation
of the data model and our operators can be found in a technical report [4].&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Intended audience and goals of the talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The targeted audience are analysts and/or developers that already have some
knowledge about graph systems, e.g. semantically expressive graph database
systems like Neo4j or generic graph processing systems like Apache Giraph.
The goal is to present our concept of combining those two approaches to allow
powerful graph analytics in a distributed way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains. Hence, graph database systems are becoming increasingly important. In the study of these systems, it is vital that the R&amp;amp;D community has shared benchmarking solutions for the generation of database instances and query workloads having predictable and controllable properties. Similarly to TPC benchmarks for relational databases, benchmarks for graph databases have been important drivers for the Semantic Web and graph data management communities. Current benchmarks, however, are either limited to fixed graphs or graph schemas, or provide limited or no support for generating tailored query workloads to accompany graph instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To move the community forward, a benchmarking approach which overcomes these limitations is crucial. In this talk, we present the design and engineering principles of gMark, a domain- and query language-independent open-source graph benchmark addressing these limitations of current solutions. A core contribution of gMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generated graph instances and the generated query workloads coupled to these instances. A further novelty is the support of recursive regular path queries, a fundamental graph query paradigm. We illustrate the flexibility and practical usability of gMark by showcasing the framework's capabilities in generating high quality graphs and workloads, and its ability to encode user-defined schemas across a variety of application domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with Guillaume Bagan, Angela Bonifati, Radu Ciucanu, Aurélien Lemay, and Nicky Advokaat.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wisp is a language for Guile which represents Scheme sexp structure transparently using indentation. It makes Scheme look easy for non-Schemers without losing any of its power.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;»ArneBab's alternate sexp syntax is best I've seen; pythonesque, hides parens but keeps power« — Christopher Webber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to present its syntax, show some of the elegant solutions with Guile using wisp to make them easy to read, and describe how wisp was cleanly integrated in Guile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisp is specified in SRFI-119.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How can Guix and Guile participate in increasing network freedom? Discussions include leveraging Guix to make server deployment and maintenance a better experience, as well as ideas in how Guile could provide leadership in web development and federation.  Perspectives from the needs of GNU MediaGoblin for deployability will be presented to the audience, as well as contextualizing Guix deployment in terms of "UserOps" (in parallel with / in contrast to DevOps).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gnu.org/s/guix"&gt;GNU Guix and GuixSD&lt;/a&gt; provide a transactional package manager and purely declarative GNU/Linux distribution.  Under the hood, Guix builds upon a unified set of &lt;a href="https://gnu.org/s/guile"&gt;Guile&lt;/a&gt; Scheme programming interfaces, making it "The Emacs of Distros."  This talk will give an overview of those APIs and how they can be used.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover things like store remote procedure calls (RPCs), multi-tier programming with G-expressions, the monadic store API, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Examples from Ruby gems, Python modules and R/CRAN</subtitle>
        <track>GNU Guile</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix allows creating higher level abstractions. This means you can have a short and elegant way to describe any source package. We added support for Ruby gems and Python modules to GNU Guix. We think the process of adding them is interesting for others who would like to support their language and or software stack.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The GNU software packaging project is packaging done right. Ruby deployment with rubygems used to be pretty good, years ago, but over time it has turned into a nightmare of dependencies. Tools like RVM, rbenv and bundler try to bring some level of control for running multiple versions of Ruby and gems, but over the last years they are showing their limitations clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when should you look at GNU Guix? You should look at Guix when you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;are serious about software deployment
need to handle multiple versions of Ruby or gems
want clear isolation of dependencies
want clean separation of gems
want a reproducible environment
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix allows you to define a software package once with all its dependencies. Every time you install the package it gets reproduced exactly with its exact dependency graph, all the way down to glibc. See this figure. Whether you are a sysadmin who needs to deploy an exact Rails stack or you are a developer and need to support user environment, GNU Guix is the solution you require. Use cases are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;test gems using multiple versions of Ruby
install concurrent rubies with or without linked openssl support
run minimal ruby to be exposed to the web
update ruby in production and roll-back after a problem
run multiple versions of the same gem against one ruby
run multiple versions of openssl dependencies
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use your imagination. The point is that you control the full dependency graph. Always. You can even give users rights to install and share software because the underlying system is ‘immutable’. Existing graphs can not be overwritten by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix is a next generation software package installer with a range of features, including sane dependency handling, transactional and reproducible installs which can be rolled back. In short, GNU Guix has resolved the fundamental problems of software deployment and management. GNU Guix also should play well with Docker and VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It adds: direct support for nested commands (e.g. foo bar --baz); automatic generation and parsing of configuration files; automatic --help message generation; automatic --version message generation; backward compatibility with getopt-long; fully functional approach (if desired).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch is a distributed and scalable data platform written in Java that, besides the transport protocol (Java to Java), offers a very complete REST API accessed through JSON. This talk will cover the details of the Elasticsearch client we built for Lua as a part of the GSoC program in the LabLua organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the elasticsearch-lua client a programmer can access most Elasticsearch functionalities and benefit from: proper load balancing across all nodes with pluggable and multiple selection strategies; a connection pool; and the reindex feature (not available in Elasticsearch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also show how this client could be used to implement a search feature in a website that is based on a SQL database, and how can we use the data in Elasticsearch to also perform fast analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lua is a very fast and powerful scripting language that can be easily embeddable. It has been shining in industries like game development, for example. Lua is also an excellent tool as a general purpose language and can be used to develop robust applications. Its use in web developments, however, despite its great potential and incredible benchmarks, needs to be more widespread. This talk will mention the current state of Lua in web development, show some benchmarks, compare existing tools and teach developers how to get started with Sailor, an MVC web framework written in Lua.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hammerspoon is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You can write Lua code that interacts with OS X APIs for applications, windows, mouse pointers, filesystem objects, audio devices, batteries, screens, low-level keyboard/mouse events, clipboards, location services, wifi, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically you would write a configuration file in Lua that connects events to actions. You might want to bind a keyboard shortcut to a series of window operations, or an applescript. You might want to run a series of commands when your wifi interface connects to your home network. You might want to display an alert when your battery drops below a certain percentage. You might want to do something crazy like have iTunes automatically start playing when your Mac detects you are in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Lmod: Building a Community around an Environment Modules Tool</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lua</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;On today's supercomputers, chemists, biologists, physicists and
engineers are sharing the same system and they all need different
software. Environment Modules have been the way since the '90 that
users select the software they need.  They allow users to load and
unload the packages they want.  They get to control which version of
the software they use, rather than the system administrators.  Lmod,
implemented in Lua, is a modern replacement for the venerable TCL/C
based tool. Lmod offers many features to handle the vastly more
dynamic software environment than the original tool was designed to
handle.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lmod is a modern, flexible, robust environment module system: the
system tool that "sets the table" by helping supercomputer users load
the software packages they need to do their work. They get to control which version of
the software they use, rather than the system administrators.  It is a Lua-based
drop-in replacement for the venerable TCL/C environment module
system. Because needs vary across the diverse computational research
community, module systems like Lmod are mission-critical, ubiquitous,
and expected on such systems: users need help selecting the correct
combination of tools from among the thousands available on modern,
large-scale systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a talk about Lmod's features or design; instead, the focus
is on process, community, and culture.  What is it like to develop,
maintain, and support a tool for a community that is often unaware
that it (or Lua) even exists?  How does one go about diagnosing and
correcting problems on systems to which you cannot get access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the talk also addresses an important Lua-related issue. A module
system loads a given software package by interpreting a 'modulefile'
that describes the details of the environment that software package
needs. Lmod's native modulefiles are Lua programs; Lmod parses legacy
TCL modules by translating their instructions into Lua. This approach
has been very successful, but has not been without its challenges:
this talk includes an introduction to some of the associated technical
issues and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been an interesting ride, from a local tool deployed at a
single site in Texas, to an open source mainstay that is mission
critical at hundreds of supercomputer centers around the world. World
domination through Lua and Lmod, one center at a time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>LGSL: Numerical algorithms for Lua</title>
        <subtitle>A Lua-ish interface to the GNU Scientific Library</subtitle>
        <track>Lua</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LGSL is a collection of numerical algorithms and functions for Lua, based on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). It allows matrix and vector manipulation, linear algebra operations, special functions, and much more. LGSL is based on the numerical modules of GSL Shell, and requires LuaJIT.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LGSL offers an intuitive interface to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) functions, giving you easy access to a well-tested scientific toolbox from your favourite Lua application. The bindings use the LuaJIT FFI, which makes the installation of LGSL a breeze. No compilation is required: all you need is LuaJIT and the GSL shared library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGSL is based on the numerical modules of GSL Shell. While GSL Shell is recommended as an all-in-one interactive scientific shell which includes plotting capabilities and general data tables, LGSL aims to be an easy-to-include Lua module with a more limited focus. It includes the numerical algorithms, special functions, and other goodies from GSL, as well as linear algebra operations which harness the power of BLAS. A selection of functions were reimplemented in Lua, to get the most out of LuaJIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will demonstrate the features of LGSL and discuss how it was tuned to be blazingly fast thanks to LuaJIT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After nearly 8 years of development, what have we learned from developing an ambitious software project in Lua?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When Prosody began, in 2008, Lua was not an obvious choice for developing a real-time network service. Compared to alternative languages, Lua had a poor ecosystem (and some say, still has). Node.js was not yet born, and the world was not used to the idea of serious high-performance services being written in high-level "scripting" languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things have changed since that time, both in the Lua world and beyond. "Why Lua?" is no longer our top FAQ, and the Lua ecosystem has improved considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We faced challenges along the way, and learned a lot. This talk examines some events in our project's history as they relate to the Lua language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Design and Implementation of the MoonGen Packet Generator</title>
        <subtitle>Using Lua for high-speed network testing and benchmarking</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MoonGen is a scriptable high-speed packet generator suitable to test network devices with millions of packets per second at rates of above 10 Gbit/s.
Each packet is crafted in real time by a user-defined Lua script to ensure the maximum possible flexibility.
MoonGen is available as free and open source software &lt;a href="https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2015/papers/p275.pdf"&gt;scientific paper describing it&lt;/a&gt; was published at the Internet Measurement Conference in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;What is MoonGen?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonGen is a flexible high-speed packet generator. It can saturate 10 GbE links with minimum-sized packets while using only a single CPU core by running on top of the packet processing framework DPDK. Linear multi-core scaling allows for even higher rates: We have tested MoonGen with up to 178.5 Mpps at 120 Gbit/s. Moving the whole packet generation logic into user-controlled Lua scripts allows us to achieve the highest possible flexibility. In addition, we utilize hardware features of commodity NICs that have not been used for packet generators previously. A key feature is the measurement of latency with sub-microsecond precision and accuracy by using hardware timestamping capabilities of modern commodity NICs. We address timing issues with software-based packet generators and apply methods to mitigate them with both hardware support and with a novel method to control the inter-packet gap in software. Features that were previously only possible with hardware-based solutions are now provided by MoonGen on commodity hardware. MoonGen is available as free software under the MIT license in our git repository at &lt;a href="https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen"&gt;https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Using Lua for Networking Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonGen is 90% Lua. Each single packet that is sent out is crafted in real time by a user-defined Lua script which needs to process millions of packets per second. There are several challenges that are addressed by MoonGen in order to achieve this. The most important one is multi-threading: all modern NICs are natively multi-core aware and linear multi-core scaling is a must for any modern packet processing app.
This talk will address how MoonGen uses a shared-nothing architecture to implement multi-threading via multiple LuaJIT VMs, how the real-time requirements of a packet generator can be fulfilled despite interruptions from the JIT and the garbage collector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;More Information on MoonGen&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2015/papers/p275.pdf"&gt;scientific paper describing MoonGen&lt;/a&gt; was published at the Internet Measurement Conference in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tarantool: an in-memory NoSQL database and execution grid</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lua</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tarantool is an open source in-memory database and execution platform, based on Lua. The database supports transactions, secondary keys, replication, triggers, and the application server provides an inside-the-database semantics for cooperative multitasking and non-blocking I/O. This presentation focuses on a practical use case: task queue application, using Tarantool as an application server and a database.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of the task queue is that producers put tasks (objects) into a queue, and consumers take tasks, perform them, mark as completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The queue must guarantee certain properties: if a consumer failed, a task should return to the queue automatically, a task can't be taken by more than one consumer, priorities on tasks should be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tarantool, a task queue is a distributed networked application: there are multiple consumer/producer endpoints (hosts) through which a user can interact with the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The queue itself is a fault-tolerant distributed database: every task is stored in Tarantool database and replicated in multiple copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a machine goes down, the state of a task is tracked on a replica, and the user can continue working with the queue through a replica. Total power failure is also not an issue, since tasks are stored persistently on disk with transactional semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance of such an application is in hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.At the same time, the queue is highly customizable, since it's written entirely in Lua, is a Lua rock, but the code is running inside the database. This is the strength of Lua: one size doesn't have to fit all, and you don't have to sacrifice performance if you need customization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. It combines signaling protocol (SIP) with rich multimedia framework and NAT traversal functionality into high level API that is portable and suitable for almost any type of systems ranging from desktops, embedded systems, to mobile handsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "10 days, 500k users: how we built a realtime mobile social network in Africa" that was due to have been given by Simon Tennant, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend as he has fallen ill. We wish him a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session, Steven Goodwin will practically demonstrate the various "moving parts" necessary to build a WebRTC application, by creating one live on stage.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the marketing hype suggests you can build a 'Skype in a browser' in an afternoon, it doesn't really tell you how. Or where the problems will occur. This talk will cover both the client and server-side code necessary. Targeted at developers of all levels who are unfamiliar with webRTC, it will provide a better understand of how WebRTC applications work under the hood, what the API provides, and serve as a guide as to what is (and what is not) possible for the developers to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Janus is an open source WebRTC Gateway developed by Meetecho conceived to be a general purpose one. As such, it doesn't provide any functionality per se other than implementing the means to set up a WebRTC media communication with a browser, exchanging JSON messages with it, and relaying RTP/RTCP and messages between browsers and the server-side application logic they're attached to.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any specific feature/application is provided by server side plugins, that browsers can then contact via the gateway to take advantage of the functionality they provide. Example of such plugins can be implementations of applications like echo tests, conference bridges, media recorders, SIP gateways and the like. A few examples describing how these plugins can be used as "bricks" to build a more comprehensive and complex application will be provided. Some references to existing usages of Janus and third-party imlementations will be presented too, as well as some notes on future plans and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Proposed Session Description&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Internet Telephony has evolved over the years from simple office PBX to clustered voice services. CGRateS project was born out of today’s market demand for performance and scalability when it comes to Real-Time Charging. 
In this talk Dan will briefly introduce CGRateS’s architectural concepts and advantages of using it for distributed charging, exemplifying use cases for account bundles, fraud detection with automatic mitigation or advanced real-time call statistics with actions triggered on threshold hits.
CGRateS is a battle-tested, real-time Charging Engine which supports 4 different charging modes: Prepaid, Pseudo-prepaid, Postpaid and Rated
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Sharp.Xmpp, a multiplatform .NET XMPP client library and Android</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;h3&gt;Sharp.Xmpp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharp.Xmpp is a multiplatform, Windows and Android, .NET XMPP client library. It supports IM functionality &amp;amp; a variety of XMPP extensions, is simple and is extensively tested against both Android and Windows platforms. It is a fork of the currently frozen excellent S22.Xmpp project.
In the first part of the presentation will discuss Sharp.Xmpp capabilities, protocols supported, examples for usage and extension. The second part will focus for using Sharp.Xmpp for mobile development for Android, lessons and experiences learned.
Necessary hooks, alarms, network connection events, ping time, and battery consumption information will be provided, from a Sharp.Xmpp perspective and mobile development using Mono.
Sharp.Xmpp since its release has gained some uptake, since, to the best of my knowledge, it one of the very few available modern C# open source XMPP libraries currently available. Participation in the conference will help expand uptake, and its contributor base.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library fully implements the XMPP Core and XMPP IM specifications and thus provides the basic XMPP instant messaging (IM) and presence functionality. In addition, Sharp.Xmpp offers support for most of the optional protocol extensions. More specifically, the following features are supported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-SASL Authentication (PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5, and SCRAM-SHA-1)
-User Avatars
-SOCKS5 and In-Band File-Transfer
-In-Band Registration
-User Mood
-User Tune
-User Activity
-Simplified Blocking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a fork, of the excellent but now inactive S22.Xmpp library and features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-API designed to be very easy to use
-Well documented with lots of example code
-Very easy to add extensions
-Open source MIT License, suitable for a wide range of business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library is extensively tested for a multi platform Android/Windows project, user base has been increased, as well as patch contributors. It offers C# a versatile way to start building XMPP applications.
Sharp.Xmpp for Android
In the second part experiences from using Sharp.Xmpp in a mobile Android application will be provided. Android platform features will be discussed and code snippets such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-setting Android alarms for keep TCP connections alive,
-network connection events detection,
-server pings before timeouts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will be discussed from a C# Xamarin perspective. Using techniques described connection stability and battery consumption are excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;XMPP is coming back, and is here to stay!
Through a large collection of analysis and interviews, as a Product Owner in different organisations, we can say now that XMPP is getting out of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will review where we were, where we are, and where we are headed. This answers, the why, and what?
This is also a wake up call for consciousness, and product/market fit. This answers the why, and who?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You can view XMPP and Instant Messaging from different angles:
* If you observe the market since the the 90s, you will see the three generations of Instant Messaging:
  * The first generation: ICQ and its clones
  * The second generation: WhatsApp and its clones
  * The third generation: Slack and its clones =&gt; this is just the beginning
* If you use the Gartner Group's "Hype Cycle":
  * XMPP has passed the the "Peak of inflacted expectations", and is now in the "Trough of dillusionment" (read the "XMPP myths" thread on Hacker News)
  * So expect a "Slope of enlightenment" and a "Plateau of productivity".
* If you consider the communities (including commercial entities):
  * Some have lived and died, some wake up, some just minimalistically maintain their software and infra...
  * There is wave of cleanup of dead things, and a wave to help the XSF&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Openfire is almost universally recognised as the worst XMPP server, and well known as having been dropped by its original authors, and left to rot, unmaintained and buggy. So why has it just made a 4.0 release, and who cares, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when the majority of this audience were still in school, there used to be an amazing server called Jive Messenger. After two renames, it was called Openfire, and everyone loved its powerful admin interface, full modern featureset, and astounding integration capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Jive decided they didn't want to be in the XMPP business anymore, and threw it over the wall, leaving it to languish in the bitrot bin. Everyone - and I mean everyone - knew that using Openfire was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it's back - but did it ever go away, and does it really deserve the reputation of the worst XMPP server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Cridland is the Project Lead of Openfire, despite hating Java and being not very good at it, and in this talk will attempt to take credit for the revival of a much-loved server that he has had nothing much to do with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Zero-Knowledge and Serverless Collaboraiton</subtitle>
        <track>Real Time</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most realtime collaborative editors make use of a class of algorithms known as Operational Transformation. Most of these algorithms require that the server and the client run the same algorithm otherwise risk desynchronisation - the nightmare of realtime collaboration algorithm designers. I will propose a new method of finding consensus using a blockchain of the type originated in bitcoin. This algorithm uses the blockchain to find consensus on the state of the collaborative document or data-structure then applies the Operational Transformation on the client side without requiring any help from the server. Such a setup simplifies the server side, allowing multiple implementations of the server, for example in different programming languages, but it also allows the client-side to use encryption in order to keep the data secret from the server. Finally, I will propose an extension to this algorithm which, borrowing again from bitcoin, makes the system able to function purely as a peer-to-peer system, providing high resilience and greater security.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lecture Notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know me, I'm Caleb James DeLisle, I'm a researcher at XWiki where we make
technology to help people collaborate and share information. Today I'm going to talk about a
realtime collaboration algorithm but in order to fill in the history for this, I need to explain
a bit about about distributed consensus. Consensus is something which we need more often than we
know and until recently we did not know how to do distributed consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of distributed consensus was made really popular by the Bitcoin protocol. Not only did
Bitcoin claim to achieve distributed consensus but it claimed the ability to achieve consensus
amongst machines operated by mutually antagonistic parties. There is, however, another aspect of
distributed consensus which gets a bit less attention but has probably has had as much impact if
not more. That is consensus in distributed "no-sql" databases. To give a little background, it's
interesting to look at how traditional high-volume databases are architected. At a financial
institution you usually would have an Oracle database with master/slave replication and sharding
where possible but where you have, for example, the accounts database, you ended up with this
bottleneck in a single machine. If you were to split up this master database then you run the risk
of what in bitcoin parlance is known as the "double spend", I send money to Alice and Bob at the
same time and my account can't support both. NodeA thinks Alice got paid and the transfer to Bob is
invalid, NodeB thinks Bob got paid and the transfer to Alice is invalid, thus the distributed
database becomes desynchronised. This problem comes up in almost every type of database and the
traditional solution has been to make sure the main database ran on one computer.
Obviously total reliance on a single machine is a recipe for problems and to solve these problems,
organisations spent money. In traditional enterprise settings, the database master has become the
crown princess. It's not uncommon to see RAIDs containing multiple mirrored high availability SSDs
or even battery backed RAM based storage. Microprocessors looked more like something one would
expect to see in a top end gaming machine and duplicating an entire master with a "hot spare" is not
uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tech world, there wasn't the money to run these beasts and with the margin of error in their
applications being far wider than those in the financial industry, the stage was set for something
different to emerge. Google BigTable, Amazon Dynamo, Hadoop, Cassandra and Mongodb were the
beginning of a new approach. Behind the changes to the database query language was the ability for
multiple master nodes. Unlike bitcoin, no-sql did not promise to work with nodes which are trying
to attack eachother but at least with honest nodes it promised to come to reach agreement. The logic
of this was astonishingly simple, servers would tell each-other about the transactions they receive
but they would tag them with the id of the previous transaction and a timestamp, if it received a
conflicting transaction with an older timestamp then it would just revert it's own and apply the
other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does all of this have to do with collaborative documents?
Well a collaborative document is another thing which really really needs to be the same for all of
the people editing it. If you are working on a document and your version is different from one that
someone is collaborating on, that's a big problem. In collaborative documents, two people altering
the same content is a very common situation and instead of simply rejecting one change, the state
of the art is to try to transform it into what the user "probably would have wanted" using what is
known as Operational Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the traditional method has been that the server and the clients both needed to have
the Operational Transformation functions and those functions are famously difficult to implement for
collaborative editing of rich text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly this type of algorithm implies that there must be a central server and that server must be
able to read all of the content which is being edited. From a privacy standpoint it's not the best
deal but the real difficulty is that with the same algorithm needed on the client side and on the
server, programming languages in which the server can be implemented are quite limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a new algorithm called ChainPad, this algorithm makes use of a limited blockchain.
Like no-sql, ChainPad does not resolve cases of mutually antagonistic parties but as long as the
people editing are not trying to attack you, the algorithm will find consensus, even with
out-of-order messages from a peer-to-peer transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without going to full peer-to-peer, we can do zero knowledge. Zero knowledge means that the
server which hosts the data does not have the ability to read it. With traditional realtime this is
not possible but with CryptPad, the server does nothing more than to pass messages between the
clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many companies and individuals have already deployed large SIP networks with tons of endpoints. With WebRTC becomeming so ubiquitous, it makes sense to adapt for these new types of devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012 SylkServer (http://sylkserver.com) allowed for seamless SIP to XMPP interoperability, now we are adding WebRTC as a first class citizen. Using SIP as the core routing and rendezvous protocol and either SIP, XMPP or WebRTC at the edges we can reuse existing SIP insfrastructure with the right gateway in place.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Liberating communication with Matrix</title>
        <subtitle>Building an open ecosystem for real time communication that's as decentralised and successful as the Web.</subtitle>
        <track>Real Time</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Matrix is an open standard for open decentralised real-time communication using simple HTTP APIs and WebRTC, providing fully decentralised communication history with cryptographic integrity and no single point of control over any given conversation.  Since our debut at FOSDEM 2015, the project has grown significantly as we've added end-to-end encryption, glossy clients, read receipts, WebRTC conferencing, and built bridges and integrations with a huge range of existing communication networks.  This talk discusses the challenges we've hit along the way, and updates the FOSDEM community on how our mission is progressing!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, most commonly used VoIP and instant messaging apps do not interoperate, and all your data is stored in each service, locking in users and fragmenting their conversations and contacts between different vendors. In the Matrix ecosystem, anyone can run a server (called a "homeserver"), and a communication room is owned by all the homeservers participating in that room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can communicate via any client or service that understands the Matrix protocol; we provide open source implementations for web and mobile, and members of the community have written many other open source clients in languages ranging from QML to Emacs. We have also written bridges that enables a homeserver to connect to existing protocols such as IRC, XMPP or SIP, and solutions such as FreeSWITCH, Asterisk and even Lync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we will explain the design choices we made when creating Matrix, the challenges over the last year, and we will look at different clients and servers that have been implemented (both by ourselves and the community).  We'll demo the latest features such as end-to-end encryption and video conferencing, and show how Matrix is a viable option for all your open realtime communication needs!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The stability of a webchat is dependent on numerous factors, ranging from quality of code and browser compatibility, to the stability of the infrastructure and the way it handles network instabilities. To make a sensible comparison between webchats or to measure changes in stability with a new version of a webchat, there needs to be some kind of standardized testing. In this talk I will show how I have set up an automated testing environment that automatically simulates numerous potential problems, including network instability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using a real world example, I will discuss in this talk:
-Potential sources of instability in webchats
-Selecting what tests are relevant
-Setting up automated testing of webchats
-Testing the behaviour of the webchat on unstable networks
-Results and lessons learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code used for the testing is available on GitHub:

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since before its standardization by the IETF in 2003, the XMPP Standards foundation and its community has put lots of effort into protocol design, documentation and implementation. But this technical work alone is not enough to ensure the success of XMPP in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should we be working on, as a community, to bring freedom of communication to the non-technical masses?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the non-technical aspects of developing an open communication platform for the internet. XMPP has been continuously developed on the technical front for over 15 years, but what is our goal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many folk in the community, the goal is giving people the ability to communicate freely by giving them an unrestricted choice of software and service. Yet instead of outreach to those people beyond our community, our efforts are primarily poured into mailing lists, technical specifications and code. Small efforts to engage with those outside of our community and beyond our "comfort zone" of technical work can make a large difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll look at some of the work that has been, is being, and can be done by all of us to tackle today's proliferation of non-free proprietary messaging silos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Creating rich WebRTC applications with Kurento</title>
        <subtitle>Or why you need a media server for the cool WebRTC stuff</subtitle>
        <track>Real Time</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WebRTC is a disruptive media technology bringing real-time multimedia communications to HTML5 standards. WebRTC is currently available for billions of users as a built-in feature of common browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. This makes possible the emergence of a truly open and interoperable technology competing with proprietary conferencing solutions and enabling developers to create specific-purpose WWW peer-to-peer real-time media applications in a simple and seamless manner.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;However, WebRTC developers commonly require more than plain peer-to-peer video conferencing. For this, we introduce &lt;a href="http://www.kurento.org"&gt;Kurento&lt;/a&gt;, a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) initiative build on top of GStreamer providing developers a set of high level abstract APIs making possible the creation of HTML5 multimedia-enabled web application. &lt;a href="http://www.kurento.org"&gt;Kurento&lt;/a&gt; pushes GStreamer to a next level building a media server with interesting features such as media recording, media mixing for group communications, media adaption and transcoding, media augmentation, integration with computer vision capabilities, etc.
In the talk we will introduce what’s &lt;a href="http://www.kurento.org"&gt;Kurento&lt;/a&gt; and how WWW developers can take advantage of it showing the following aspects of the framework:
•First, introducing &lt;a href="http://www.kurento.org"&gt;Kurento&lt;/a&gt; Java and JavaScript APIs and we explain how they interact with the signaling plane in an application server. This allows WebRTC application developers to create their application logic using popular technologies such as Java EE or Node.js.
•Second, by presenting a unique media plane written on top of GStreamer. GStreamer is based on the concept of media pipelines, which can be seen as chains of media elements performing operations to a media flow in real-time. Currently there are more than 1000 media elements written for GStreamer implementing many different capabilities such as codecs (e.g. H.264, H.263, VP8, etc.), recorders and players (for storing/recovering media from files), blenders (for augmenting media), filters (i.e. face blurring, face recognition, etc.) and others. Hence, &lt;a href="http://www.kurento.org"&gt;Kurento&lt;/a&gt; enables to inject WebRTC streams into a chain of such elements and perform, in real time, the operations the developer wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the capabilities of Kurento, this talk will also present some advanced demos and examples showing augmented reality and computer vision capabilities applied on top of real-time video-conferences&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How we built a decentralized blogging engine with XMPP</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For the Libervia project, we have developed a blogging/microblogging engine based on XMPP and PubSub. This talk explains how we have done, what we can do, and the gain of using XMPP&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blogging technologies are most of time based on centralized website with e-mail validated comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XMPP is a set of various technologies, and one of them is “Publish/Subscribe”. We have used this extension and other ones to build a decentralized blogging/microblogging engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using XMPP has many benefits, that will be explained in this talk:
- using a standard allow us to communicate with other project (Movim, Live Jabber, Jappix, etc)
- comments are using the strong XMPP authentication, no need for email validation
- because of this authentication, spamming is more difficult
- we can change the software rendering the blog easily
- comments/articles are pushed in real-time
- articles or comments can be easily linked
- third party software manipulation is easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also explain how some features are managed like tags, private blogging, search, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;TLS and SIP - The Session initiation Protocol - is not a match made in heaven. In the original RFC TLS wasn't really handled well and TLS usage has changed since then, in many RFCs. There are still some issues to handle, as well as ideas about how to apply DANE - TLS verification based on DNSsec. This talk explains TLS, the current usage in SIP, how SIP Outbound comes into play and what's needed in order to proceed with a high degree of interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is fairly well known to the early adopters , that the devops movement would never have happened if it weren’t for a number of open source enthousiast and contributors to share their code, pains, problems , solutions and expierences at different conferences before devopsdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet today , there still is a large gap between the developers of different distros and the people that deploy and use them, the ops ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everywhere you look you will find gaps between the developer and the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about closing these gaps. It will be about helping out eachother to make Open Source solve even more Business needs.

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Having spent more than the last decade being the main point of contact for distributions shipping MySQL, then MariaDB Server, it's clear that working with distributions have many challenges. Licensing changes (when MySQL moved the client libraries from LGPL to GPL with a FOSS Exception), ABI changes, speed (or lack thereof) of distribution releases/freezes, supporting the software throughout the lifespan of the distribution, specific bugs due to platforms, and a lot more will be discussed in this talk. Let's not forget the politics. How do we decide "tiers" of importance for distributions? As a bonus, there will be a focus on how much effort it took to "replace" MySQL with MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Benefits: if you're making a distribution, this is the point of view of the upstream package makers. Why are distribution statistics important to us? Do we monitor your bugs system or do you have a better escalation to us? How do we test to make sure things are going well before release. This and more will be spoken about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an upstream project (package), we love nothing more than being available everywhere. But time and energy goes into making this is so as there are quirks in every distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Docker has brought an ease of use without comparison with VMs typically to
build native upstream distribution packages. Where before it was needed to
launch a complete environment, copy the sources into it, invoke the build tools
to create the packages and then copy them back to the host, Docker has made all
these steps much easier and straight forward, allowing for more rapid package
production and automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will show a detailed use case for building packages for both
Mageia and Fedora with their respective bm or koji tools encapsulated in Docker
containers. It should help any upstream packager adopt a similar approach to
make his packaging task a breathe.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Design and issues with ported software</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What are the features of Haiku's package management system? How does its design impact packaging of ported software? We'll answer this and list some good and bad practices that affect the portability of software to Haiku.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the BeOS, a desktop operating system ahead of its time but where software were still packaged as zip files or click-to-install files distributed manually, Haiku has grown a dozen years this way. But things change, and Haiku made the big leap into modern software packaging, with a new infrastructure that could probably inspire even mainstream GNU/Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haiku's package management is a radical change from its historical roots, affecting even native software despite existing APIs like find_directory(). Ported software are also impacted by those changes, but also benefit from HaikuPorts which streamlines packaging for Haiku developers and changed their lives literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not unlike other packaging frameworks like Guix, Haiku's package management required changes to the filesystem layout inherited from BeOS, including making parts read-only. It brings many features but also complicates porting sometimes, which will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;game-data-packager is a tool that automate the creation of .deb or .rpm
packages for local consumption from commercial games assets.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Handling of non-free non-redistributable data like shareware games assets
are commonly handled by fragile shell scripts that involve wget, unzip, md5sum
provided by the different distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;game-data-packager provides a way to share these unofficial
packaging efforts in a central location; only a tiny
part of this tool is distro-specific and is handled
in a nice OO-model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDP has builtin support for the Steam &amp;amp; GOG.com online sellers
and will also apply the patches needed by your games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDP would also fill a common need of upstream game engines
providers that either have to document all the needed files:
(like http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles)
... or have to provide their own installer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is a popular package manager for OS X. Compared to most Linux package managers we have some pretty major differences from how we run the project (pull-requests on GitHub) to how we interact with the system (try to use system-provided libraries when possible) and use of root (we actively refuse to use it). Come and hear about how we'd do Homebrew differently if we were starting it from scratch today and what other package managers can learn from our failures and successes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;VirtualBox comes with a set of drivers and tools designed to improve integration between the systems running in it and the system it is running on.  We have generally preferred to provide these ourselves, but Linux distributions also wish to do this (and do).  This talk looks at the reasons, and invites discussion about how we can better address them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My plan is to spend about ten minutes talking and ten discussing (discussion can continue after the talk of course).  I won't expand much on the abstract for ten minutes of talk, but my hope is that this will help us and distributions to better cater to each other's needs.  Clearly not all of the issues are specific to VirtualBox (our main issue is that we want to provide the latest and greatest even on distributions in maintenance mode), so the benefits of discussing them should be greater too.  And of course, since VirtualBox is a popular tool for distribution development work, improving integration is likely to be a good thing for lots of people in the room!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EDF develops and uses a custom Linux distro which has been  based on Debian since 2003. This distro covers scientific workstations, HPC clusters and servers. Each major version is maintained in-house for security and bugs with a five-year life cycle. Specific tools ensure business application compatibility across different releases. Everything is streamlined towards industrial R&amp;amp;D and fits in corporate IT infrastructures. This talk will present the project goals, features and announce the creation of a community site for collaborative Open Source development of the distro. A dedicated kick-off event will also be announced in Paris during 2016. We are looking forward to questions, remarks and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Accepted Talks:
 * Linux Server Administration for non-expert users - Alessio Fattorini&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Using a Linux server for an organization infrastructure has many undeniable benefits: stability, security, hardware performance, TCO, freedom.
 But that doesn't mean there aren't some drawbacks (usually outweighed by the benefits), that we should consider and try to reduce or remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Introducing a Linux server in an organization usually has a pretty significant impact: new process, new interface to learn (CLI), new commands and services, new way of doing pretty much everything on the infrastructure. Unexperienced (on Linux) members of the IT team will be most likely skeptical of such a new solution, therefore we have to deal with the resistance to change, which is common and understandable, or we will end up with part of IT team members being left behind by these changes to their work routine. Improving this situation is mandatory and that’s exactly the mission of the NethServer project: make a Linux distribution for servers more accessible, easier to adopt and simpler to understand, thanks to a powerful and extensible web interface that simplifies common administration tasks. Because we believe simplicity can still be powerful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A package is more than a binary - make it observable</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Users (and developers) don't just want to run an executable, they also like to know that it runs efficiently, that it doesn't use unnecessary resources and if it crashes and burns they want to collect the pieces and inspect what went wrong. So a package should also provide the user with a means to easily profile, trace and debug what is running on their system. This means a distro should also package symbols, debuginfo and sources for easy/automatic installation. With different distros and different versions of distro packages running next to each other in containers we need some standard conventions to identify executables (build-id) and match and fetch the needed symbols, debuginfo and sources to help the user profile, trace and debug any binary they find on their system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will go briefly over differently tools for shared library abi inspection, tracing, debugging, profiling and post-mortem crash analysis. What extra information such tools need, like CFI/backtrace, symbols, gnu_debugdata, debuginfo and sources. Then we will discuss the tools that are used on Fedora to extract and package the extra information. How build-ids are used as a means to find/match the information. So the user/developer can know exactly which version of a library was actually running when the core file was created for example. And identify some deficiencies in the current packaging. It is impossible to install both the 32bit and 64bit version of the debuginfo for example. What extra challenges there are when you might be running different versions of a package in different containers. And some suggestions on tools and conventions that distro packages can adopt to make all this easier for the user and tools. At the end it would be nice to have a discussion how other distros deal with some of these challenges. How distros/packagers can coordinate on making this information (a symbol/debuginfo server) available cross distros and how/if to extend these ideas to non-native ELF/DWARF executables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <slug>format_for_build_and_integration_instructions</slug>
        <title>The story of a declarative &amp; structured format for build and integration instructions</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are many, many ways of writing build and integration instructions
for software packages. I am going to talk about them!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Package build and integration instructions are usually written as
code. It's hard to analyse code and get any interesting info out of it.
It's hard to share fragments of code and expect them to still work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-defined, structured format for build and integration instructions
would allow developers and integrators to share, analyse and use packaging
rules and build instructions, independently of any distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baserock definitions format is a YAML format that can describe how
to build a whole Linux system from scratch. It's been developed over the
past 4 years. I am going to talk about the choices behind it,
compromises, the pain points, and I will compare it with the other
options we have for describing packaging rules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software Collections are a consistent way of developing RPMs that allows for parallel installation of binaries. With containers and unikernels being all the rage, do we still have a need to parallel install binaries? Why not just make a new container? A new VM? Come to our talk to understand a little bit mora about what Software Collections are and why the authors believe they are still very relevant. We might even be able to work in a demo!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Reproducible and Customizable Deployments with GNU Guix</title>
        <subtitle>Why "app bundles" get it wrong</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;“It used to work perfectly, then I upgraded something, and somehow…”  Sounds like a déjà vu?  Sometimes feel like software deployment is unpredictable?  Ever wondered if you can trust your compiler or the integrity of those binary packages you have downloaded?  Falling for VM/Docker images to address the shortcomings of “traditional distros”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces GNU Guix, a package manager that implements the &lt;em&gt;functional package management&lt;/em&gt; paradigm pioneered by Nix to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Guix supports transactional upgrades and rollbacks, as well as support for multiple software profiles.  In this talk, I will introduce functional package management and demonstrate Guix on practical use cases.  We will show that the approach provides better resource usage and transparency than "app bundles" as popularized by Docker.  I will discuss the implications on (bit-)reproducible packages and environments, and how this can lead to &lt;em&gt;verifiable&lt;/em&gt; binaries.  Lastly, we will see how this extends to whole-system deployments with GuixSD, the Guix System Distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Italian defense organization - Army, Navy and Air Force - is migrating to LibreOffice and ODF, in one single large project coordinated by a mixed group of soldiers and community members. The odd relationship between an extremely structured organization and a loosely tied community, which have learned to trust each other and to work together to reach a single objective.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Italian defense organization - Army, Navy and Air Force - is migrating 150,000 desktops from various flavors of MS Office to LibreOffice and ODF, in one single large project coordinated by a mixed group of soldiers and community members. The first shift will migrate 55,000 desktops in 2016, while the remaining 95,000 will be migrated during the following four years. So far, the combined project team has trained a group of 32 trainers and support professionals, and the trainers have done the first short training to Rome based division IT managers.
The presentation will tell about the odd relationship between an extremely structured organization and a loosely tied community, which have learned to trust each other and to work together to reach a single objective. Also, it will explain the technical activity for the integration of LibreOffice with the three different document management systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open Document Format has been tested at so-called Plugfests over the years. At these plugfests compatibility between ODF implementations is tested. This started out as a manual process with a wiki and USB sticks. ODFAutoTests have increased the amount of testing that can be done at a plugfest. More testing could be plugfests lasted longer. To make that possible, a web server is being developed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The web server builds on the ideas of OfficeShots and ODFAutoTests. The current version is implemented in Haskell with the Yesod framework. The talk will go into the workflow of testing and how it can be implemented in a web page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The help is a vital component of high quality applications. Help files need continual maintenance when the application is improved further. LibreOffice provides the "HelpAuthoring" extension, to make contributions to the help easier for help authors. It serves both developers and dedicated users. This talk shows how to use the tool and provides a glance at its operating principles.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Added to LibreOffice 4.0 for the first time, sidebar became a popular part of its UI. providing access to more and more functionality with every release. This talk (or better, tutorial) will enable new as well as experienced developer to dive deep into anatomy (structure) as well as physiology (function) of sidebar and its decks and panels. At the end, you should be able to create your first panel, either in LibreOffice core or as an extension.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>using afl to fuzz keyboard input for UI testing LibreOffice</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We use american-fuzzy-lop for fuzzing various file formats that LibreOffice supports. Here I demo some amusing hackery to use afl to fuzz a stream of keyboard events in order to attempt to flush out unknown or difficult to reproduce bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;American fuzzy lop (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically its used for file format fuzzing. In this case the file format is a trivially serialized sequence of keystrokes, allowing afl to be an engine to drive the LibreOffice UI to generate test cases that crash LibreOffice via user events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the best thing, that could have happened to LibreOffice is the development its online version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can edit typographic quality documents in a browser using arbitrary page layout with page styles, headers and footers, footnotes, linked frames, custom fonts, also with font features, like true small capitals and ligatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These WYSIWYG document editing and form filling capabilities aren't limited by incomplete web standards and clients, and they are based on the OpenDocument format and its embedded XML based form standard, XForms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made minor, but important LibreOffice improvements, too, like changing the default, unprofessional ASCII apostrophe to the long-awaited typographic one (U+2019) in online and desktop versions of LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the problem of the simplified toolbars of the online version, we allowed to use nearly all keyboard shortcuts of LibreOffice in the online version, also adding new ones for compatibility and better usage, for example the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-F for footnote insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will show several online document editing examples, focusing on the typographic quality and easy layout management (like online usage of the OpenDocument character, paragraph, list, page and other styles, the strengths of Writer word processor), and the related developments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

You will hear about the internals too - how do we use LibreOfficeKit, what's happening during the client and server communication, and how we designed the server to scale.  This actually presents work of many people, so I hope to credit them in the presentation too.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice Writer was always capable of mass-sending mail using mail merge,
but setting it up is far from easy. One obstackle there is having to create
three different documents: a Writer one, a Base data source and e.g. a Calc
document containing the real data. LibreOffice 5.1 has a new feature to allow
embedding the data source definition into a Writer document, meaning you can
get along with e.g. a Writer and a Calc document. Come and see how it's
implemented, where are the still rough edges and how you can help.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During the last year on two hackfests I worked on exporting custom shapes from LibreOffice to OOXML (DrawingML). The limited time did not permit a systematic approach or full implementation, rather I wanted to solve bugs reported by users. I will present the problems, the results, the tools which I used, and possible future developments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gerrit Code Review is a code review and project management tool for Git based projects.
Gerrit makes reviews easier by showing changes in a side-by-side display, and allowing
inline comments to be added by any reviewer. Gerrit is used by many open source projects,
like OpenStack, Wikimedia and LibreOffice. In this talk I will present new exciting
features in 2.11 release, like support for editing changes in browser, hybrid OpenID+OAuth
authentication scheme just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This will be a Workshop about Graphic Primitives. These are used for the Office's EditViews for visualization. All DrawShapes are visualized using them, Draw/Impress use them to display the whole EditView. They are also used for Overlay Objects like Selections and Interactions.
This talk will give an overview of DrawingLayer Primitives, their usage and future, their basic concepts, how to use them and how to create own Primitives to make use of them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Come hear about the work on the Visual Class Library (VCL) in
the last year - the bottom of the cross-platform graphics
system that LibreOffice is built on.
See how we've re-factored the per-platform backends, improved
the lifecycle mechanism (VclPtr), re-vamped our main-loop
(the idle handler re-work) as well as many other long overdue
improvements. Also hear about how we're using OpenGL to
accelerate rendering and improve quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An exploration of the seL4 kernel from Genode's perspective</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Microkernels</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The seL4 microkernel is the world's first OS kernel that is formally verified to contain no bugs. After several years of development as a proprietary technology, the kernel was eventually released as open source in summer 2014. This prompted me to explore the use of seL4 as base platform for the Genode OS framework. The talk will introduce seL4, explain the interplay of Genode with the kernel, and present the current state of development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Genode OS framework is a tool kit for building component-based operating systems. It combines microkernel technology, capability-based security, and virtualization with a unique component architecture that allows it to scale from static embedded systems to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in 2008, Genode was designated as user land for the L4 family of microkernels. In that spirit, it supports most members of the family including L4ka::Pistachio, L4/Fiasco, OKL4, NOVA, and Fiasco.OC. Each of those kernels has different pros and cons. Genode enables software developers to target all of them at once, and allows system integrators to pick the kernel that fits best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seL4 kernel is the latest and supposedly greatest member of the L4 family. What sets it apart from all the others is the premise, under which it was designed and developed: The formal verification of the kernel's correctness while achieving high performance. Similarly to NOVA and Fiasco.OC, it employs capability-based security as the fundamental mechanism for guarding the access to kernel objects. But in contrast to the existing kernels, it also attacks the fundamental problem of managing kernel memory from the user land - a problem that used to be conveniently ignored by all prior L4 kernels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years of development behind the closed doors of NICTA, seL4 was finally set free under the GPL license in 2014. From Genode's perspective, this sounded almost too good to be true: An open-source microkernel that is formally verified to be correct, well documented, backed by an enthusiastic community, and equipped with all the basic functionality required by Genode!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that - as a Genode developer - I was thrilled to bring both projects together. After conducting a series of experiments exercising the kernel interface, I started adapting Genode to seL4 as a personal side project. Even though the seL4 kernel and the Genode user land should intuitively fit perfectly together on paper, the devil lies in the details. In the talk, I'd like to share those details, the challenges that had to be overcome, and the solutions I came up with. It provides insights into both the seL4 kernel interface and Genode's underpinnings, and gives a glimpse of the future direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Porting HelenOS to RISC-V</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is the most recent attempt (originally from UC Berkeley) to design a brand new instruction set architecture based on the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. One of its goals is to be completely open and free (both as in free beer and as in free speech) for designers, users and manufacturers. HelenOS is an open source operating system designed and implemented from scratch based on the microkernel multiserver design principles. One of its goals is to provide excellent target platform portability and it currently supports 8 different hardware platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Both projects are still in the process of maturing: While the unprivileged (user space) instruction set architecture of RISC-V has been declared stable in 2014, the privileged instruction set architecture is still in a stage of draft and is allowed to change in the future. Likewise, many major design features and building blocks of HelenOS are already in place, but no official commitment to ABI or API stability has been made yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces both projects, presents the initial lessons learned from porting HelenOS to RISC-V and evaluates the portability of HelenOS on yet another porting effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;HelenOS could not have been developed without certain tools such as compilers, interpreters and emulators. In many cases, these tools have been evolving or leaving their age of infancy at the same time as HelenOS. The long exposure to these tools gave us invaluable experience regarding their strengths and weaknesses. In this talk, I would like to share some of it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Hurd recently saw some experimental work to add sound support. This was done thanks to the Rump kernel, embedded in a library. As a first-working implementation the library is directly linked into mplayer, but of course we plan to make this much more flexible by moving the Rump sound driver into a separate translator, very much like we did for network drivers with netdde. This however poses design questions. The other hardware bit missing on the Hurd is USB support, which we should be able to add a similar way. This poses yet more design questions, as to the shape of the hird of translators we should start for this. This will of course also be the opportunity to give the now-traditional yearly latest news about the Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Minix-vmd is a fork of MINIX 1.6 developed by Kees Bot and Philip Homburg.
The goal of Minix-vmd was to go where MINIX could not go. MINIX was to
remain simple enough for students to understand. Features such as virtual
memory, job control, virtual filesystems, etc. where out of scope.
Minix-vmd was created to see what MINIX would look like with those
features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will go over the history of Minix-vmd, highlighting
features that sometimes made it into MINIX2, in some cases to be dropped
again from MINIX3. Features that never made into any other MINIX
version. Features that might be too radical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also briefly touch upon the importance of eating your own
dog food. Taking an experimental system into production elevates it beyond
that of a toy system. Minix-vmd has been in various forms for production
use for over two decades. For me personally, Minix-vmd is my main internet
router for the last 15 years, handles my e-mail, usenet, backups,
DNS for my domain, and ntp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Genode's TrustZone demo on the USB Armory</title>
        <subtitle>Application of Genode as microhypervisor for Linux on an open source computer - story, design, and use</subtitle>
        <track>Microkernels</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The USB Armory is an open source computer in the form of a USB stick. It
normally runs Linux. But thanks to the ARM TrustZone capabilities of the
device, it is possible to run the Genode OS Framework as microhypervisor
behind the back of Linux. This is useful for shielding sensitive information
like cryptographic keys from Linux by exposing it to Genode only and thereby
drastically reducing the attack surface. Even in the event Linux gets
compromised, e.g., by a vulnerability in the USB stack, the secrets remain
protected.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I'll first give a short introduction into the USB Armory project
and its motivation. After that, I'll tell the development story of Genode's
microhypervisor scenario. I'll also illustrate how the TrustZone technology is
used to isolate Genode from Linux without compromising the rich feature set of
Linux, and how both worlds can safely communicate with each other. Last but
not least, I'll demonstrate the scenario itself and how it can be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Defining abstractions and mechanisms for inter-process communication
is at the heart of every new microkernel design. This talk will
introduce MH, a microkernel at its early stages built to experiment
with the idea of a microkernel interface heavily inspired by hardware
architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will continue by showing how, by exposing an interface
composed of entities well known to OS-level engineers, such system
can be used to express classical operating systems interfaces or to
experiment with newer ideas altogether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An introduction to LXD</title>
        <subtitle>Managing containers just like virtual machines</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Introduction to LXD, the container lightervisor by its project leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LXD is a container management tool built on top of LXC and offering a REST API to manage and interact with multiple container hosts over the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will go over the main features of LXD, a pretty thorough demonstration of its abilities, a run through the work currently being done and end with questions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LXD is a project which began a bit over a year ago, by the same team who built LXC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's building on top of the very stable LXC library and adds a whole network layer to it through a simple and clean REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's user experience was rethought from the ground up, favoring security and reliability, using every single kernel security feature available to provide a safe, yet extremely fast environment. Reliability is achieved through extended error handling and the use of container images in place of locally built container templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LXD focuses on infrastructure containers, that is, containers running a full Linux distribution exactly as you would in a virtual machine. It doesn't know about nor care about application containers (docker, rocket, ...). Those technologies are great to manage micro-services and are a good way to distribute software, as such they make a lot of sense, inside a LXD container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information on the LXD project can be found at: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd
The code may be found at: https://github.com/lxc/lxd
And a fully feature, interactive demo of its capabilities here: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Several new kernel features are under development which will improve the container experience.  We will go over these features, explain how they benefit containers, and demonstrate each.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new kernel features are under development which, if successful will improve the container experience.  These include cgroup namespaces, loopback namespaces, fuse mounts in unprivileged containers, targeted file capabilities, stacked apparmor profiles, and udev message namespacing.  These would allow containers without a "true" root user to create and mount filesystems, use file capabilities to reduce the root privilege used in the container, better virtualize cgroup usage, protect containers from their own workloads using apparmor, and better delegate hotplugged devices to containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll go over these features and their current status (at the time of FOSDEM).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Docker is not just for deployment. As a developer, there are many ways Docker can make you more productive, regardless of how your app gets deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, you will learn practical strategies for using Docker, including how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run unit tests locally in multiple environments with almost no overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your integration tests easy for anyone to run by distributing them in a Docker image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulate advanced network topologies, especially for a service-oriented architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a Docker image in 5 minutes or less that produces builds from a consistent environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate database state changes in your test suite by using a pool of disposable containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Filesystem fragmentation is long standing and well known problem. Modern filesystems has effective techniques and tools to minimize fragmentation and aging effects. But filesystem aging can not be avoided completely. This is true for all filesystems: ext4,xfs,btrfs,zfs,logfs,etc.
This becomes a very serious problem for container/cloud solutions because most solutions use thin-provision storage.
This talk overview existing techniques, our experience and new tools we develop for OpenVZ project&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Kubernetes Autoscaler, We'll look at:
 - How to access the Kubernetes API securely
 - The different Kubernetes resources, such as Pod, Replication Controller, Service, etc.
 - How to update/manage your entire cluster using the API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll demonstrate all of the concepts via a custom autoscaler that scales a stateful application using custom metrics!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The idea is to build a cluster of containers which will be managed by Kubernetes. We will test the fault tolerance of the containers supervised by Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The lab/workshop will introduce the Kubernetes project and its importance. Many of us have started running containers in production or production like environments but the tooling to make it fault tolerant is still not very clear. With this lab, the idea is to start with introducing basic concepts of Kubernetes like pod and replication controller and in what situations they can be used. We will create a pod and a replication controller spec and run it using Kubernetes to run a container based setup. We will kill the container manually to observe how Kubernetes react to such situation.

        <title>New horizons for the CRIU project</title>
        <subtitle>Things worth doing in the checkpoint-restore project</subtitle>
        <track>Containers and Process Isolation</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While doing the checkpoint-restore-in-userspace project for several years we've collected a number of interesting things that worth being researched and implemented. These include purely technical tasks an all levels starting from hacking the kernel and up to the CRIU itself, as well as tricky math problems. The talk is about the most interesting stuff from this list.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Checkpoint and restore is the task to get as much information as possible about running Linux processes, saving them as a set of files and recreating back the processes in the original state, so that they do not notice the change. There has been a lot of implementation of this technology, but nowadays the mainstream one is the CRIU project. During several years of work on it we've met several interesting things that could be implemented as a part or on top of the core CRIU, but that are put aside for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting technical things is how to organize the logging. Logging in C/R is very critical as if checkpoint or restore fails without the most detailed traces of the process it's extremely hard to debug what's going on and what steps lead us to failure. On the other hand, generating too many log messages may slow things down significantly. How to find the balance between fast and informative logs and how to generate the messages in the fastest way possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the kernel-level issue is -- to get information about a process CRIU does a LOT of system calls. And a huge amount of time is spent on reading various /proc files. Optimizing this thing would be a tempting kernel feature, but what's the best way? Speeding up the /proc, ability to merge severas syscalls into one, or developing yet anther subsystem that would report info about processes faster and more flexible that proc does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as math problems are concerned, the best one we have is: given a graph of objects and rules for creating vertices and edges, guess (or evaluate) the sequence of rules that would generate this graph our of an empty one. In Linux language it may sound as -- how to fork(), setsid(), open() and do other syscalls to generate the process tree with resources in the state we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and some other thinkers are to be presented at the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linux containers as a virtualization solution are becoming more prevalent. An example of a container solution is rkt, whose development started end of 2014. Under the hood, container software on Linux uses the same cgroups and namespaces API. Both container software and kernel code for containers continue to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alban will first describe the Linux API that make containers possible: namespaces and cgroups. Then he will explain how rkt containers use this Linux API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of Twitter's infrastructure is powered by open source. For cluster management we use Apache Aurora and Apache Mesos to run a variety of workloads across multiple large clusters, each typically tens of thousands of servers. Almost all of Twitter's stateless services run in Aurora/Mesos and we're constantly working to migrate other workloads into Aurora/Mesos. Through many years of development, and lots of hard learned lessons, we've helped build an extremely reliable, scalable, and robust platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesos provides a unified abstraction of cluster resources to one or more scheduling frameworks (Aurora is one example) which run a variety of workloads. To fully achieve the resource abstraction, Mesos must ensure that co-located jobs are well contained and isolated from each other. To do this Mesos has several options for containerization and resource isolation, implementing its own control of Linux cgroups and namespaces or delegating to external providers like Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll speak about some of the lessons learned running large scale containerized infrastructure at Twitter and talk a lot about where we're heading next. I'll focus on isolation improvements to support other workloads and to support increased system utilization, all while maintaining (as close as feasible) the ideal resource abstraction. In particular, we're looking at effective CPU isolation when co-locating very latency sensitive services with latency insensitive batch-style workloads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Capsicum is a security framework that allows process isolation and sandboxing based on the principles of capability-based security.  This talk will give a brief introduction to Capsicum and capabilities, with some comparisons to the security mechanisms available for Linux containers (namespaces, cgroups and seccomp-bpf).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aim to cover:
 - Privilege separation is the most effective way of securing software against future (classes of) bugs.
 - Capabilities allow the "privileges" to be precisely specified.
 - Capsicum blends capabilities with traditional POSIX semantics, in a pragmatic way.
 - Comparison with (Linux) kernel mechanisms for container isolation (e.g. namespaces, seccomp-bpf, cgroups).
 - Current Capsicum status on FreeBSD and Linux.
 - Potential future Capsicum work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack is an implementation of the App Container Spec from CoreOS that runs on FreeBSD, using jails for process isolation and ZFS for storage management. I will be speaking about the motivation behind starting a new implementation rather than porting an existing one, about Jetpack's goals, the technology it uses, its architecture and implementation challenges. A quick demo is not unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Contract testing provides a means for developers to provide tests to implementers of Java SPI and API frameworks to ensure that the expected functionality is correctly implemented.  It is an open source junit extension that tests implementations of java interfaces.  This talk will cover why and how to execute tests.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Contract testing provides a means for developers to provide tests to implementers of SPI and API frameworks to ensure that the expected functionality is implemented. Junit-contracts is a Junit runner and associated annotations that allows developers to develop test for correct implementation of an interface that are then reused by any implementation of the interface. The junit-contract tests suite does this automatically discovers the tests to be run and executes them. This presentation is an overview of the design principles behind the junit-contracts tool, how to develop tests that it can run, and how they can make development easier for project developers, QA teams and the system integrator while reducing support requests and problem tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation is intended for development teams that provide an SPI or user extensible API and who wish to provide tests that ensure the correct implementation of interfaces. This talk should also be of interest to QA testers that need to validate that a number of implementations of a single interface are correct and for systems integrators to wish to ensure that implementations of SPI/APIs in glue code function correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You, of course, write open-source software. They didn’t. And for the sake of your mobile users, you both need to be friends. Enter Frida, the diplomat (she’s really only a library, but don’t tell anyone). She has coaxing superpowers that allow you to expose the innards of binary-only software, be it other libraries, operating systems, or other OS processes you must deal with. You can program Frida to infiltrate closed-source software, and expose their internals into abstractions you can use for testing the interoperability of your software. Want to lift some of their logic into your mock? Or replace a few functions in their binary code with your mocks? Hopefully, you want to do that using high-level languages such as JavaScript and/or Python, because those are the ones Frida likes the most.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we use Frida, the scriptable, dynamic instrumentation toolkit, to expose internal functionality from binary-only software. By exposing internal functions and data structures, tightly integrating software often becomes easier to test at fine granularity. What previously had to be larger integration tests dependent upon several running subsystems, may, with a little effort, become isolated test fixtures that are easier to reason about. We show you unfortunate souls who have to deal with this level of interoperability how to program Frida to identify and expose functions in remote processes, and how to combine these exposed functions into small test fixtures in a unit-testing style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Testing embedded systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of IoT, this presentation makes the case for TDD and BDD in general and focuses on its use within embedded software development.
Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) are established tools in the traditional IT realm and are at the core of the XP methodology.
This presentation incorporates these methodologies with the world of Embedded programming. Using TDD and BDD  tools such as Unity and Cucumber, we'll explore how to develop and test software that runs on the target devices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Unity, I'll show how unit tests can be run on target embedded devices as a better alternative to using simulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, using the Cucumber gem, I will demonstrate how to use feature files in the context of working on embedded hardware projects and explain how to extend the framework using the Wire protocol to allow integration tests to run in-situ, which greatly enhances testing coverage compared to PC-based testing using emulators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will show stories from the trenches of developing tests for SSSD and Samba. How we developed complete integration tests that exercise all the capabilities of our software and run in environments without a real network access, without requiring root or sudo or touching the important OS interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The authors of this talk work on SSSD, Samba and libssh - software that communicates over the network, often requires root access and communicates through OS interfaces. In this talk, we will show how we developed complete integration tests that exercise all the capabilities of our software and run in environments without a real network access, without requiring root or sudo or touching the important OS interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, our goal was that the tests must be easy to develop and must run both locally on developer's machine as well as inside popular CI engines of today, like Travis or Semaphore. To meet these goals, we had to leverage existing testing tools, but also build new ones such as pam_wrapper or libpamtest to be able to test OS-level PAM authentication and authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be useful for developers who write tests for software that is normally not easy to test -- attending the talk will show you how to test complex software systems in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jobs in Jenkins (or any other CI/CD tool) can be created and updated manually using GUI. It is ok if you have a few/several of them. However, most of the companies grow and you can quickly wake up with dozens or hundreds of jobs to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new email address/alias to get notification about failed builds? Global migration to the better™ SCM? No way to do it manually with GUI in a convenient way. It just doesn’t scale. Manual scripts using Jenkins API? Better, but hard to test and maintain. The same applies to plugin installation, credentials managements etc. Luckily, there is a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the talk we will present how Jenkins Job DSL together with Ansible can be used to automatically provision Jenkins instance and maintain any number of jobs. We will show how to define jobs and views in Groovy based DSL and test automatically that the generated structures are exactly the same as expected in Jenkins. Expect live demo - we will setup fully functional Jenkins instance with just one click!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title> Simulating Humanoid Robots in the Cloud: the testing behind the biggest world competition</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Testing and Automation</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;June, 2015: a raceway in California hosts the biggest real size humanoid robot competition in history with 26 teams from all over the world. It was the Darpa Robotics Challenge. The goal of the contest was to push the limits in robotics to assisting humans in responding to natural and man-made disasters. Two years before, as the first part of the contest, took place the Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC) which consisted on replicate the same set of tasks proposed in challenge finals but using cloud-based robotic simulation instead of real robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), thanks to its open source robotics simulator Gazebo and the ROS (robot operative system) framework, was selected to rule this virtual contest. It was a challenge to manage the software infrastructure, from the simulator to machine provisioning, and testing played a key role. The talk will review the testing practices that were designed and implemented during the development of the software infrastructure used for the Virtual Robotics Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was the testing of a robotics contest in the cloud done? What did we learn about testing software from organizing the VRC? How using open source software helped to organize the VRC?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will review the testing practices that were designed and implemented during the development of the software infrastructure used for the Virtual Robotics Challenge. The scope of the techniques applied goes from automated testing of VRC software pieces (Gazebo simulator, DRCSim - DRC specific ROS wrappers and materials and the Cloudsim web provisioning tool) to the manual testing plan. Interesting points to explore in the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The root of all testing done: our continuous testing integration (CI) setup. Jenkins, and how GPU testing is done on it for different platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of moving continuous testing integration to run as soon as possible in  production machines (real challenge machines).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How different cloud providers were tested and when and how the problems appeared. Experience here is nice to know since problems were not trivial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the “release often, release early” philosophy was applied during the development cycle to keep users in the testing loop. How nightly builds played a fundamental role in this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the ideal testing does not exists and how can real production tests with real users be the best of your test suites. How was that scheduled in VRC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How exceptional cases, like identifying an exploit hours before the competition, were managed to not affect the testing done before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The goal would be to provide the audience with feedback and conclusions about software testing and testing decisions in a real big open source robotics software event from first hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As architectures decompose into smaller pieces, figuring out the root cause of latency can become quite tricky. This session will review distributed tracing tools that can be used in your production systems to debug performance problems. While the focus is on Zipkin tools in practice, we'll also discuss related works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Latency analysis is the act of blaming components for causing user perceptible delay. In today's world of microservices, this can be tricky as requests can fan out across polyglot components and even data-centers. In many cases, the root source of latency isn't a component, but rather a link between components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will overview how to debug latency problems, using call graphs created by Zipkin. We'll use trace zipkin itself, setting up from scratch using docker. While we're at it, we'll discuss how the model works, and how to safely trace production. Finally, we'll overview the ecosystem, including tools to trace ruby, c#, java and spring boot apps. We'll wrap up with a look at simulation with Spigo and future works in Distributed Context Propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you leave, you'll at least know something about distributed tracing, and hopefully be on your way to blaming things for causing latency!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Developing and maintaining distributed systems like Hadoop is difficult.
The difficulty comes from many factors, but we believe that one of the most important reasons is lacking of a good debugger for bugs specific to distributed systems. (e.g., non-deterministic hardware faults, message ordering, ..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the talk, we will show Earthquake, our open-source debugging framework for distributed systems.
Earthquakes permutes Ethernet packets, Filesystem events, Java/C function calls, and injected faults in various orders so as to control non-determinism in the cluster.
Basically, Earthquake permutes events in a random order, but the user can write his/her own state exploration policy (in Go language) for finding deep bugs efficiently.
Earthquake also controls non-determinism of the thread interleaving by calling sched_setattr(2) with randomized parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also share our successful stories about testing some Hadoop components with Earthquake.
For ZooKeeper, we found a distributed race condition bug which decreases availability of a ZooKeeper cluster.
We also reproduced a known ZooKeeper bug that no one had successfully reproduced for 2 years, and analyzed its cause.
For YARN, we found a disk-fault tolerance bug that inappropriately marks faulty node as healthy.
We also found bugs of non-Hadoop softwares, such as etcd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Earthquake, you can also test your real distibuted systems without any modification.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The BSDA certification is designed to be an entry-level certification on BSD Unix systems administration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing candidates with a general Unix background and at least six months of work experience as a BSD systems administrator, or who wish to obtain employment as a BSD systems administrator, will benefit most from this certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful BSDA candidate is able to complete common administrative and troubleshooting tasks and has a good understanding of general BSD Unix and networking principles. In addition, the successful candidate demonstrates basic skills with these BSD operating systems: Dragonfly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. This does not mean that the candidate needs to learn the complete details of four operating systems. It does mean that the candidate is aware of the basic utilities common to these operating systems, and where specified in the exam objectives, of features unique to some of the BSD operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Scheduling in The Age of Virtualization</title>
        <subtitle>Genral Thoughts and a Case Study</subtitle>
        <track>Virtualisation and IaaS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, an operating system scheduler was &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;One_ entity in charge of deciding what  "activity" would run on a physical processor. Furthermore, such "activity" would pretty much all the time be an application (or system) program. Well, guess what: these days, things are more complicated! Applications and physical processors have moved away from each other, as one or more layers have been put in between them. In fact, in a typical virtualization/cloud scenario, we have a hypervisor, providing the abstraction of virtual processors, and it is onto them that applications run. And here we are: running an application inside a virtual machine requires a virtual processor to be scheduled on a physical processor --at the host level-- and the application itself to be scheduler on the virtual processor --at the guest level. So, two schedulers (at least!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do these two schedulers interact right now? How should they interact ideally? Should they be closely related, completely independent, or something in the middle? Are they better be based on the same algorithm? Or do different layers have different enough needs to require highly specific solutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will go through the above (and more) questions, trying to outline pros and cons of a few approaches. That will happen both in a "theoretical" and practical sense. The latter meaning that we will be looking at some real scheduling traces (at both host and guest level), and at numbers from different benchmarks. The main focus, especially of the 'case study' part, will be on the Xen's scheduler(s) (i.e., on the interactions between Xen's and Linux's schedulers) but we will have a look at a few KVM data points as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Scheduler to rule them all. One Scheduler to find them, One Scheduler to bring them all and...&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, while investigating, and trying to improve, performance of the Xen hypervisor, a number of non previously obvious interactions between host and guest level scheduling have been identified. This means, in case of Xen, interactions between the Xen's scheduler (at the host/hypervisor layer) and the Linux scheduler (at the guest layer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traces have been collected and benchmarks have been run, in order to figure out the exact nature of those interactions, and even more in order to amend or, at least, mitigate, the ones that were causing badly performing behaviours. Similar situations when other hypervisors (namely, KVM) were in use, have been inspected too, out of interest and for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of such investigation, both in terms of generic thoughts and reasoning, and in terms of traces and numbers is what the talk will cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Security is on everyone's mind these days, software will always have bugs
that can be exploited. In virtualisation, those bugs are more often found
in device emulators and the hypervisor itself includes a few of those, for
performance reason. How can we mitigate the severity of those bugs?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will talk about limiting the impact of bugs in device
emulators by deprivileging their execution. Right now, they run with the
same privileged as the rest of the Xen hypervisor, but we will show what we
can do to execute these emulations in a deprivileged context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution comes with a performance cost. We will learn the cost
compared to the original and try to apply this to emulators that are either
not used often or that takes much more time to execute than to switch to a
deprivileged context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Xen on x86 platforms offers two kinds of virtual machines: PV and HVM.
PV is the oldest kind of guest, doesn't need any emulation, but requires
extensive modifications to the guest operating system kernel. HVM is a
newer kind of guest, which exploits hardware virtualization extensions,
and offers an emulated PC-like environment. Linux typically runs on Xen
as a PV guest but can also run as an HVM guest very efficiently. Windows
runs as an HVM guest only.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;QEMU is a critical component in Xen deployments because is in charge of
emulating most devices for HVM guests, including IDE disks and PCI
network cards. In fact in the Xen community QEMU is often called the "device
model". QEMU's emulated interfaces are conveniently available for the
guest to use. At the same time of course they are also exposed to
malicious guests, which are inevitably going to try to find
vulnerabilities in those interfaces, to take control over the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore securing QEMU is critical. QEMU should be protected from guest
attacks, not just in best case scenarios, where deployments use advanced
and complex security hardening techniques, such as stubdoms or SELinux,
but in all cases, for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will show the defense in depth mechanisms which the
Xen Project is putting in place to secure the execution of QEMU in Dom0
by default. The talk will explain the reasons behind the design choices
and how they compare against other hypervisors and other deployment
scenarios. Users will learn the trade-offs of the different solutions
and will learn how to discern secure from insecure configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as a Service deployment has replaced traditional
dedicated hardware in many datacentres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today's cloud computing also has its limitations, which makes it not
suitable for applications with strict timing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why real time systems, like telecommunication, trading, and
control systems, are mostly still deployed in the traditional way and
can not make use of all the advantages IaaS deployments have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is about a real time enabled OpenStack prototype, which enables
real time virtual machines connected to the outside world with real time
networking.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;KVM has improved a lot with regard to hosting guests with real time requirements.
What is still missing is the integration with a complete management stack so that users do not have to tune every detail themselves.
We will present an ongoing project in which we use a stack of Preempt-RT Linux, QEMU/KVM, libvirt and OpenStack for RT CPUs.
For real time aware I/O, device assignment currently is the best way to go, but that does not scale well.
So we decided to implement networking using vhost-user combined with a DPDK-based software switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will explain how we tuned the overall system and where we had to change individual components of the stack.
There will be a presentation of preliminary results, and if time allows a short demonstration.
It still is a prototype with some of the changes not suitable for mainline yet.
So we will also discuss current limitations and close the talk with plans and ideas for future work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In 3.6 we've added support for showing content information for Hosts/VMs managed through Katello.
And the sky's the limit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in 3.6 we introduced the host upgrade manager feature in oVirt, so I'll talk about that as well, and show how you can easily upgrade your hypervisors.
In the session I'll deep dive into each part of these functionality, covering also future plans to integrate the three to give a wider solution to our users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Virtualization management requires processing continuous streams of data, mostly for monitoring purposes. It is therefore challenging to make sure the different services are able to act properly, rather than become overloaded with incoming data. "Reactive" concepts can help overcome such challenges. In this presentation I'll show how oVirt embraced these concepts and evolved to Reactive architecture, and show the impact it had on overall system performance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the process of refactoring how oVirt processes data we have been learning what it is required to change model from proactive to reactive. I want to share our successes and failures during the process because we are/were heavily constrained by backward compatibility. People thinking about performing similar changes would benefit by learning from mistakes that we made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In modern virtualization platforms virtual machine disks are stored in various kinds of shared repositories which are accessed by thousands of hypervisors simultaneously.  Changes are constant.  How can you provide high performance access to these resources while ensuring a consistent view of the world across all systems?  When bad things happen, how do you restore the integrity of the data?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will share an approach being taken by the oVirt virtualization platform to address these challenging storage problems.  Complex storage tasks are broken down into simpler metadata and datapath operations.  A set of rules for handling each type will be established.  Through several examples, the audience will learn how a combination of SAN-based locking, atomic commitment, and garbage collection can help to achieve a high performance, fault-tolerant storage architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Federation was introduced in OpenStack release "Juno", but is still an interesting topic and is still being developed. Even more, we want to make federation the first-class citizen in OpenStack Keystone. This talk will give an overview of why one would use federated identity for his cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Keystone implements Identity API, it doesn't try to be a user management tool and encourages administrators to manage users with existing fully-fledged tools. Federation allows users to authenticate with their username and password at a trusted identity provider, get a token from it and use it to authenticate in Keystone, while Keystone stores information about the user neither in database, nor in LDAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the talk I will tell about history of identity federation in OpenStack keystone, about who uses it, about existing problems, about general architecture and features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the impediments to becoming an active technical contributor in the OpenStack community is setting up your own R&amp;amp;D environment which includes making your own cloud.  How much RAM do you really need? How important is processor speed?  What else do I need to know?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using RDO-manager, get a basic cloud up and running with the fewest steps and minimal hardware so you can focus on the fun stuff - development!&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For many years MIPS processors have been involved in the embedded market, particularly in areas related to networks and storage.
With the success of the mobile market, and the great evolution of the world linked to the "makers", other architectures (such as ARM), they have reached very large levels of diffusion.
Meanwhile, the mips architecture has evolved, introducing innovations and improvements to adapt to both the processor market from performance, both to the world of microcontrollers. The future of MIPS is a new family divided into several generations evolving.
During the presentation, after a brief and simplified introduction to architecture, will be shown the technologies available at the time and what will be the future developments.
In the presentation will also show some reference platforms (ex. Imagination Creator CI20), and how to work to integrate and port on these platforms.
Application examples with yocto and buildroot, to switch to a full distribution (Debian). Finally it will also present a perspective on the use of MIPS in embedded designs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;AsteroidOS is a free and open-source smartwatch platform based on OpenEmbedded, libhybris, BlueZ5 and Qt5. The OS currently offers a basic user experience on the LG G Watch. This technical talk will briefly introduce the philosophical background of the project and more deeply its architecture's details in order to attract developers, porters and curious.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Smartwatches can be superfluous gadget making one more intrusion into our privacy or formidable platforms for developers. This is why it is important to have an open platform for this type of devices. AsteroidOS seeks to address this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will successively be focused on how to boot an Android Wear watch, on how to gain hardware acceleration on that kind of hardware, on how Qt5 and OpenEmbedded are used and on the future of AsteroidOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AsteroidOS uses similar technological choices as those of projects like SailfishOS, NemoMobile, Mer, WebOS-Ports or Ubuntu Touch but adapted to the needs of smartwatches. The architecture of those project will briefly be compared during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>FPGA Manager &amp; devicetree overlays</title>
        <subtitle>Making FPGAs first class citizens in the kernel</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FPGA Manager &amp;amp; devicetree overlays - Making FPGAs first class citizens in the upstream Linux Kernel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static System on Chip (SoC) configurations commonly found in today's embedded systems can be easily described
by devicetree files. These files provide the kernel with the necessary information about hardware devices, their connections, clocks, resets and other properties that could be either runtime probed, or would be provided by the BIOS on normal PC systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FPGAs have been present in embedded systems for a long time. Their reconfigurability
allows for in-the-field upgrades to large parts of a system's functionality.
For this kind of reconfigurability it is sufficient to reload the FPGA image once at boot,
and to present the peripherals in the programmable logic parts to the Linux Kernel in the same way as any other hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With FPGA based SoCs such as Altera's SocFPGA and Xilinx Zynq this model of reconfiguration
poses its challenges, as runtime reconfiguration (and even partial reconfiguration)
may cause parts of the fabric-based logic to temporarily (or permanently!) disappear.
In that case presenting the FPGA based logic to the kernel might lead to issues as the
corresponding device drivers don't get unloaded properly when the corresponding logic goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendor trees (that contain modifications to the Linux Kernel, that have not been upstreamed) provide userland applications with a capability to reload the FPGA image. In this case a hybrid system with in kernel drivers and userland applications is quickly forced into using ugly hacks to make it all work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FPGA manager is a vendor-neutral framework currently under development (will be in 4.4), that allows reloading FPGA images in a safe, clean and intuitive manner, while nicely integrating with the Linux Kernel's driver model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To model the dependencies of FPGA based IP in processor based SoC's the SimpleFPGA bus was developed. It allows to specify dependency topologies to reconfigure SoC busses at runtime, while dealing with issues such as runtime clock control, resets, as well as loading the correct (partial) bitstreams through FPGA Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally developed to support the BeagleBone Black's capes that require runtime pinctrl, devicetree overlays can be used to change the Linux Kernel's representation of the devicetree at runtime. Recently merged into upstream devicetree overlays provide a very natural and clean way to describe modifications to the devicetree, while keeping the whole system in a coherent state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give a brief intro to devicetree, the problems related to runtime reconfiguration and then describe the SimpleFPGA bus and FPGA Manager frameworks. Some simple examples using devicetree overlays will be given that will demonstrate why the three elements make for such a compelling combination.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will bring a fully open source FPGA toolchain for the RaspberryPi FPGA board we developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board can be seen in action at https://twitter.com/oe1cxw/status/673484838037516288&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We do have a working open source toolchain for Lattice FPGAs. We can generate a bitstream on a RaspberryPi or on any other CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will make available some of our Lattice FPGA boards for the RaspberryPi to qualified FPGA hackers and demonstrate also cool demos with lots of LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Clifford did port a 32bit Risc-V CPU to the FPGA, and can run software on the Risc-V CPU.
It is also planned to port micropython to the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yosys (Yosys Open Synthesis Suite) is an Open Source Verilog synthesis and verification tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project IceStorm aims at reverse engineering and documenting the bit-stream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bit-stream files, including a tool that converts iCE40 bit-stream files into behavioral Verilog. Currently the bitstream format for iCE40 HX1K and HX8K is fully documented and supported by the tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arachne-PNR is an Open Source place&amp;amp;route tool for iCE40 FPGAs based on the databases provided by Project IceStorm. It converts BLIF files into an ASCII file format that can be turned into a bit-stream by IceStorm tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three projects together implement a complete open source tool-chain for iCE40 FPGAs. It is available now and it is feature complete (with the exception of timing analysis, which is work in progress).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nemo Mobile is a long time FOSS operating system. Created in 2012 as continuation to Meego Community Edition, it has been actively developed since then. The newest iteration of it is to use Glacier UI as its renewed User Interface, along with its Qt Components. These components are now used in the NemoTablet adaptation, which I will present in this talk, using Raspberry Pi2 as underlying hardware and its plethora of possible peripherals to create a true DIY tablet.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, I will present the NemoTablet, a adaptation of Nemo Mobile as operating system, using the hardware from Raspberry Pi 2. Including a touchscreen and a miscellaneous powerbank, it is an enticing DIY tablet concept. Overall, the tablet adaptation, as well as mobile phone adaptation, have been the hilights of Nemo Mobile thus far. It is possible to extend this operating systems functionality far beyond this, as has been proven by eg. AsteroidOS, which uses Glacier UI fork and Nemo Mobile middleware for smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Raspberry Pi 2 introduction in February 2015, it was then possible to create an adaptation for it. This enables the myriad of functionality it offers, with its hardware provided. Initial adaptation was done originally for SailfishOS, but Nemo Mobile had the first run and checking that everything worked, before a closed system was installed. Nemo Mobile, however, was then not tried until later. The idea came once the official touchscreen by Raspberry Pi Foundation was released, so that a FOSS tablet could be built by anyone and used. Raspberry Pi 2 has non-free hardware, but Nemo Mobile itself is FOSS completely. As with all other adaptations, the questions regarding hardware freedom limitations rise for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;USB is considered by many people to be some kind of black magic or
place where the dragons live... During this talk Krzysztof is going to
smash this urban legend and show that creating custom USB devices may be
both fast and easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this presentation is to create our own USB device on a cheap
development board. To do this we have to start our journey with some brief
introduction to USB protocol. Then we will run through its Linux
implementation to scare off all the dragons. The next steps are open
source projects which support user in creating their own USB devices using
existing kernel infrastructure. Each part is supported by a suitable
demo to ensure that there isn't any black magic.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As in abstract.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Light virtualisation is often viewed as a security mechanism providing isolation on a production device or as a quick deployment tool for Cloud services. But it can also be used in automotive projects as a tool to ease the development phase.
This talk focuses on Docker benefits for the whole development cycle of an automotive project: it can increase build speeds and allows easier sharing of common snapshots between developers. Platform and application developments can also benefit from containers at various stages. Long term support is equally made easier.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses on Docker usages in AGL project and will demonstrate:
* how to use containers to increase snapshots build speed
* how to share a reference environment amongst developers
* how to create a binary distribution for platform and application development
* how to get ubiquity: development on the cloud, on-premises, on a single laptop
* how to run some QA tasks more easily
* how to use containers for long term support&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Offline experiences are enabling more unique user experiences to naturally happen without requiring an Internet connection.  From complex Embedded Systems to Mobile application, we will go over why offline is a requirement for success and how we can create that experience by using an embedded JSON database for local storage to replicate data to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the digital transformation in today’s always-connected world, users expect to have a mobile experience that is immediate, pervasive, and aware. In this way, it is crucial to build apps that meet these expectations. Specifically, it’s building mobile apps that are always available, regardless of network connectivity and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, you will learn what it takes how to build an embedded and mobile solution that has a consistent user experience, both online and offline. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Embedded &amp;amp; Mobile solutions &amp;amp; demo
• Syncing the data
• Storing the data
• Securing the data
• Cross platform data modeling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will walk away with an understanding of the design patterns required to build an app that works online and offline using a NoSQL backend – all this, through a raspberry pi and using open source technologies to sync, store and secure your data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Embedded Multicore Building Blocks (EMB²)</title>
        <subtitle>Easy and Efficient Parallel Programming of Embedded Systems</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Embedded Multicore Building Blocks (EMB²) are an open source C/C++ library for the development of parallel embedded systems. Based on MTAPI, a standard for task management in embedded systems, EMB² relieves software developers from the burden of thread management and synchronization which significantly improves reliability, performance, and productivity. This talk describes the underlying concepts, gives an overview of the main components, and explains their usage by means of examples.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Multicore processors increasingly find their way into embedded systems. However, leveraging the power of such processors requires to parallelize the applications, which is often an intricate and error-prone task. To solve this problem, various libraries and language extensions for parallel programming have been developed in the past decade. However, most of these approaches are intended for desktop or server applications and do not take into account typical requirements from the embedded domain. For example, there are usually no guarantees regarding memory consumption and real-time behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMB² library has been specifically designed for embedded multicore systems (https://github.com/siemens/embb/). It builds on the standardized Multicore Task Management API (MTAPI) and is independent of the hardware architecture (x86, ARM, ...). As a major advantage, EMB² supports heterogeneous systems consisting of different processors typically found in modern systems-on-a-chip. Unlike existing libraries, there is also support for task priorities and affinities, which allows the creation of soft real-time systems. Additionally, EMB² provides basic parallel algorithms, concurrent data structures, and skeletons for implementing stream processing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are now two major organizations developing automotive FOSS software and a third may be contributing as well. This means there is lots of automotive software available and now its able to run on cheap, available hardware like the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will take us through the available FOSS software stacks that are available for automotive. This last year has produced a lot of working software from fiber-optic networking drivers in the Linux kernel, complete In-Vehicle Infotainment stacks, to a newly released Qt Automotive. There has also been a change in available hardware to run this software on, new boards like the Minnowboard Max, Renesas' Porter board, and even the Raspberry Pi 2. This talk will try and cover the entire software ecosystem and how it matches to hardware, how you can get involved today, and what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Turris Omnia aims to bring to the market afordable, powerful and secure SOHO router which is completely open-source and
open-hardware. As a operating system it uses our own fork of OpenWrt which has some additional features such as automatic security updates. This talk will cover few topics such as motivation for starting this project and developing of our own hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013 we started a research project regarding SOHO networks security called Project Turris. As a part of the project we developed our first open-source SOHO router for analyzing malicious network traffic. Turris Omnia is a spin-off project from the original project Turris which was available only to Czech Internet users in a relatively small quantity. With Omnia we want reuse all the experience we have got with previous project and bring it to the market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FROSTED is an acronym that means "FRee Operating System for Tiny Embedded Devices".
The goal of this project is to provide a free kernel for embedded systems, which exposes a POSIX-compliant system call API.
In this talk I aim to explain why we started this project, the approach we took to separate the kernel and user-space on Cortex-M CPU's without MMU, the collaboration with the libopencm3 project to provide a high quality hardware abstraction layer and the future goals of the project. Of course there will a demo showing our latest developments: dynamic loading of applications and possibly TCP/IP communication.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Frosted is a free POSIX operating system for embedded systems based on
the ARM Cortex-M CPU family. The goal of the project is to provide a
POSIX compliant system calls interface in order to be able to run small
libraries and applications in userspace. Even if it runs on small
systems with no MMU and limited resources, Frosted has a VFS, UNIX
command line tools and a HW abstraction layer which makes it easy to
support new platforms and device drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain the approach we took to separate kernel and
user space, the design choices we made for the OS internals, our
collaboration with the libopencm3 project and our vision on the future
of Free and Open embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there will a demo showing our latest developments: dynamic loading of applications and possibly TCP/IP communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;To explain the basics of game making, two different examples will be shown. Nothing but a default installation of python is necessary to make games, so we can just focus on the different concepts and elements. Except for a minimal amount of automagic, most of the code will be very basic, no advanced knowledge is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Gunicorn, more than a WSGI server</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gunicorn is known as a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. But today the WSGI specification shows its limits and people wants more. This talk will introduce the new Gunicorn released in January with a new IPC library usable in others Python programs to handle the concurrency and support HTTP2.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gunicorn handles the concurrency using  a pre-fork worker model: workers are spawned processes managed by a main process. Until now there is no dialog between workers and the master which can trigger some issues like the thundering herd. To solve it and prepare gunicorn to support new protocols like HTTP2, a new IPC library has been specifically written in pure python. Mostly inspired from imsg in OpenBSD (but also Mojo), this new library is entirely written in Python and can be used outside of Gunicorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The design of Gunicorn 1, its pros and cons
2) Description of the new IPC library how you can use it in your own projects
3) The design of Gunicorn 2 and its usage of the new IPC library, how it can do more than simply WSGI and HTTP 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Libervia is a multi frontend decentralized social network. This talk explain how Python has been a good choice for developing this software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Building a decentralized communication software is a difficult task. The choice of the technologies to use when you start a new project will have a big impact on its life expectancy, and on the time you'll need to develop features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have choosed Python for our development, and we don't regret it. We'll do a feedback of our experience, and specially on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twisted/Wokkel which are in the core of our project (asynchronous framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyjamas that we are using to build our web frontend (python -&gt; javascript transpiler)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Urwid that we use for our console frontend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kivy that we use for our desktop/mobile frontend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standard library modules which saved us a lot of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and we'll talk about the global benefits to expect by using a popular language like Python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For the last 11 years, the Python language have been in used and abused by the Mercurial command line tools. We are now looking back at the various trap we feel into and sharing tricks about how to get the best performance and flexibility out of Python.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2005, Mercurial developers, take advantages of the Python language. This is long enough to explore many aspect of the language and be surprised multiple time. Some of the idea we tried were so great that latest version of the language have native support for them while some other were terrible terrible mistake that we are still trying to get away from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Talk will first go over some of our terrible mistakes and great success. Then we will focus on our work around performances. We'll go over various profiling techniques, various tricks to get the most CPython and finally our exploration of latest Pypy advantages and limitation for a command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Going beyond the CPython C API</title>
        <subtitle>PyPy, CFFI, etc.</subtitle>
        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will see an intro and status of two projects: PyPy, an alternative Python-in-Python implementation; and CFFI, an alternative to using the standard C API to extend Python.  These two projects are very different, but CFFI is a possible solution to a problem that hits notably PyPy --- the CPython C API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CPython C API was great and contributed to the present-day success of Python, together with tools built on top of it like Cython and SWIG.  I will argue that it may be time to look beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will see an intro and status of these two projects (the speaker is
involved in both):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PyPy: http://pypy.org/

CFFI: http://cffi.readthedocs.org/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyPy is an alternative Python implementation.  It features a JIT
compiler that gives important speed-ups over CPython, for almost any
program that runs for any amount of time (at least some seconds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues with PyPy is its forever-alpha-status "cpyext"
module.  It is the part that loads and executes CPython extension
modules --- and occasionally segfaults if the stars are not correctly
aligned.  The C API is very large, exposes the most obscure
implementation details, and assumes a memory model (reference counting)
that is often different in non-CPython implementations of Python.  Thus
"cpyext" is the best-effort solution available for PyPy, but is a hack.
(IronPython has a similar capability.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was partly the motivation for developing CFFI: it is a minimal
layer that allows direct access to C from Python, with no fixed
intermediate C API.  It is available for CPython and for PyPy and could
be ported to more implementations.  It shares ideas from Cython, ctypes,
and LuaJIT's ffi, but the non-dependence on any fixed C API is a central
point.  Some high-visibility projects like Cryptography have switched
to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>new static optimizer for CPython</subtitle>
        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Python language is hard to optimize. Let's see how guards checked at
runtime allows to implement new optimizations without breaking the Python
semantic.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(Almost) everything in Python is mutable which makes Python a language very
difficult to optimize. Most optimizations rely on assumptions, for example that
builtin functions are not replaced. Optimizing Python requires a trigger to
disable optimization when an assumption is no more true. FAT Python exactly
does that with guards checked at runtime. For example, an optimization relying
on the builtin len() function is disabled when the function is replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guards allows to implement various optimizations. Examples: loop unrolling
(duplicate the loop body), constant folding (propagates constants), copy
builtins to constants, remove unused local variables, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FAT Python implements guards and an optimizer rewriting the Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST). The optimizer is implemented in Python so it's easy to enhance it
and implement new optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FAT Python uses a static optimizer, it is less powerful than a JIT compiler
like PyPy with tracing, but it was written to be integrated into CPython.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;My name is Maciej and I'm dealing the PyPy funding situation.
Unlike a lot of funded OS projects, PyPy is independent - we are not
subject to any single large corporation power. We've gone a long way
from EU R&amp;amp;D funding, through crowd-funding and through consulting arrangements.
In this talk I would like to present our experience with funding strategies
questions and caveats associated during PyPy 10 year history as well
as how, at your company, you can promote open source solutions
and independent vendors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Open Source is just a better way to write software, this is very likely
pretty obvious at this conference. In this talk I would like to talk about
us trying to take it a step further and making it our full time job, without
a corporate oversight. I would like to present the common strategies presented
for open source project that we've gone through, notably:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D from government grants - PyPy started as a research project sponsored
through EU. The main downside is the large amount of paperwork you have to
deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;crowd funding - the main downside being that it works for very well defined
features and the funders tend to be very demanding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;consulting - the downsides are usually need to spend time working on
client code, not on the OS project itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of the above does not really work for projects like  cffi, which while
successful, does not create any obvious streams of revenue. Additionally,
I would like to present some advice how you can help open source at your
company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Guix-tox, a functional version of tox</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Python</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tox is a very well-known tool, written in Python, that allows users to run tests inside various virtual environments created using virtualenv. This approach prevents tests from being truly reproducible. We will see in this talk how virtualenv can be replaced by GNU Guix, a functional package manager, in order to improve tox. We will give real-life examples using Python packages from the OpenStack project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using virtualenv in tox raises a few issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only the packages available on PyPI can be installed, which means users sometimes have to "manually" install some packages using their distribution's package manager (for instance, lib*-dev on Debian, gcc...);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when multiple virtual environments need to install the same package, it is duplicated in each of the virtualenvs, wasting disk space;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bad level of abstraction: nowadays, every language come with its own package manager (pip, npm, cpan...) instead of using a single, robust package manager;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tests are not really reproducible because the test environments are not completely isolated from the rest of the system (think of environment variables, of the whole filesystem, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;GNU Guix is a functional package manager (as in "functional programming") based on Nix. It allows users to build packages in a completely isolated environment. We will introduce this tool and show how the "guix environment" command can be used to create an isolated environment similar to a virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we will see how virtualenv can be replaced with Guix in tox so that users can benefit from all the features of Guix without changing their usual workflow. We will show some examples using packages from the OpenStack project, such as python-keystoneclient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Pulp can be used to create and manage local repositories of Python packages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pulp enables your organization to manage repositories of software packaged in many different formats, using one set of tools. Manage RPMs, Debian packages, Puppet modules, Docker images, Atomic trees, Python packages, and more with the same technology currently used by the largest and smallest of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, you will learn:
- How to create local repositories of Python packages
- How to upload packages to Pulp repositories
- How to make Pulp automatically retrieve packages from remote repositories, like PyPI
- How to install packages from a Pulp repository&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As the power pendulum swings towards developers and open source, from sys-admins and proprietary software, respectively, Linux Distributions are faced with a challenge. How do they get more relevant to the new power brokers?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Long Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the power pendulum swings towards developers and open source, from sys-admins and proprietary software, respectively, Linux Distributions are faced with a challenge. How do they get more relevant to the new power brokers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, application and web developers have made it clear they are uninterested in packaging their applications if it requires them to do things beyond their normal languages and tool-chains. They are also not particularly interested in consuming their dependencies via distribution packaging tools if it requires a lag in availability, the developers packaging the libraries, and/or learning the packaging software tools beyond the most rudimentary level. Developers have also made it clear that the way software is packaged, normally targeted at production installations, is very cumbersome when using it for development (e.g. the perennial 'setenforce 0').&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people interpret the above as "developers don't care about security or the trustworthiness of their dependencies." However, this is a mistake. Developers do not ever want to be the person listed as the problem when a major breach occurs. On the flip side, their "bosses" (actual bosses, software communities, professors, etc) set and enforce deadlines that do not allow for the time to muck about with things not directly related to their application development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can distributions do? Well, how about they stop providing a distribution. Instead, they can provide an operating system and a set of content. Where the "things" found in the operating system part are packaged in the traditional manner and provide all the traditional guarantees. However, the "content" is provided in the native formats developers are used to and the guarantees, where possible, are provided through other mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the work taking place in the Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat EL communities to address these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Beyond reproducible builds</title>
        <subtitle>Making the whole free software ecosystem reproducible and then…</subtitle>
        <track>Distros</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reproducible builds enable everyone to verify that a given binary is made from the source it is claimed to be made from, by enabling anyone to create bit by bit identical binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This talk will report on the state of reproducible builds in various distributions (Debian, Archlinux, coreboot, F-Droid, Fedora, FreeBSD, Guix, NetBSD, OpenWrt, SuSE, and Qubes OS - to name a few) and thus should be interesting and insightful for anyone working on any free software project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Holger will explain how he started working on this in the Debian context and how his focus shifted slightly over the last 12 months. So he will start with explaining the status of Reproducible Debian, but this is quickly followed by an overview of common problems and solutions, followed by a quick explaination of the shared test infrastructure for reproducible tests of any project. You will learn how the community was broadened, what future plans we have to address what might be needed beyond being able to reproducible build something, so this becomes truly meaningful for users in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, it's a complex topic and a big task, but by now it seems we managed to get our messages accross pretty well, as for example nowadays some people already expect the immiment release of a reproducible binary distribution. Sadly it is not the only question whether this will happen in 2016 or 2017 even though it could happen, there is "just" is still a of work ahead almost &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;, in those nitty gritty details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>An overview of illumos five years later</subtitle>
        <track>Distros</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Just prior to Oracle closing OpenSolaris, the illumos project forked from it, and for five years has carried on the work started with OpenSolaris.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2010, Garrett D'Amore, Rich Lowe, and others forked OpenSolaris with the intention of reducing and eliminating its closed-source components. Unbeknownst to them, Oracle was planning to shut off publication of the OS/Net consolidation, which included the OpenSolaris kernel &amp;amp; system-critical user-space.  This coincidence propelled the fork, illumos, into the vehicle in which OpenSolaris could continue, albeit under a different name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;illumos is now over five years old, and its distributions continue to fulfill the promise of OpenSolaris.  illumos is the reference implementation of OpenZFS and DTrace. The SmartOS distribution has continued pioneering work in zones, commonly known outside Solarish circles as containers. Both OpenIndiana and OmniOS use the Image Packaging System (IPS) in traditional deployments.  OpenIndiana and XStreamOS continue work on an illumos Desktop.  DilOS (Debian) and Tribblix (SysV) use alternative packaging with illumos. Appliance distributions like NexentaStor and Delphix use and innovate with OpenZFS to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will frame the history of illumos, and what it carries forward from Sun's engineering approach to Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;At Facebook, we have been developing and using the RocksDB storage engine in a number of different services and applications.  The MySQL on RocksDB (MyRocks) project integrates this library as a plugin into MySQL, the database server which we use to store our social graph data.  We have found using a write optimized log structured merge tree design, when compared to the B+ tree implementation of InnoDB, reduces the space utilization and write rates of our production servers by half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to introduce some background on the MyRocks project and some of the features we've added to MySQL and RocksDB to support our production environment. We will also introduce some of the performance data gathered from our testing and discuss what the tradeoffs are for using RocksDB vs. InnoDB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel-user-space API is littered with design errors: APIs that are non-extensibe, unmaintainable, overly complex, limited-purpose, violations of standards, and inconsistent. Most of those mistakes can't be fixed because doing so would break the ABI that the kernel presents to user-space binaries. To further rub salt into the wound, kernel-user-space APIs are often buggy when first shipped. Thus, it's important to get API designs right the first time. Taking (good and bad) examples from past APIs, I'll cover a number ideas on improving the design of future kernel user-space APIs. Those tips are relevant both for kernel developers producing the APIs and for user-space programmers looking at what kernel developers are serving to them. I'll also look at some strategies that developers can pursue in order to get help with improving the designs of APIs that they are producing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will talk about the current developments in OpenDocument ranging from adoption, implementation, documentation, validating and testing by producers and consumers of ODF software and how they help overall software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been more than ten years since the first specification of the OpenDocument was published. The current version, ODF 1.2, has been widely implemented and adopted. Across the world, governments, businesses and people have chosen ODF as the preferred file format for editable documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, many software projects have added ODF support. Not just notable FOSS projects such as LibreOffice, Calligra, OpenOffice, AbiWord, Gnumeric and WebODF, but also proprietary offerings such as Microsoft Office and Google Docs support ODF. The ODF community has held many so-called plugfests and developed a methodology for testing interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a good point to look at the current state of ODF and what direction it should go in. ODF 1.2 is very rich with OpenFormula, RDF and MathML. Should more features be added? ODF is meant to make exchanging office documents easy. Has this goal been achieved or is there more work to do? Or should we put more effort into perfecting the interoperability between the current implementations? And what is the future of ODF on the web?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will talk about the current developments in ODF ranging from adoption, implementation, documentation, validating and testing by producers and consumers of ODF software and how they help overall software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jos van den Oever represents the Dutch government at OASIS. In 2015, the Dutch government has joined the ODF Technical Committee that specifies ODF. So far, the specification was mostly directed by the software implementors. The increased involvement from organizations that use ODF software shows that this important open file format is becoming more mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The story of how we make LibreOffice Online scale and perform
securely for a large number of concurrent users.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As LibreOffice moves online, it provides a Free Software
alternative to Office365 using a rather similar high-fidelity,
full-feature architecture. This brings a number of interesting
challenges we've had to solve. Performance challenges include - how
can we run 1000 concurrent users on a reasonably sized server ? How
can we share as much as possible of the bootstrapping and setup
functionality to reduce memory usage ? Can we really use Linux's
hugepages to reduce TLB cost ? Security is also an interesting concern
with the challenge of building a layered model to ensure that no one
bad-actor can compromise other user's documents despite having such an
extensive attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and hear the story of the development of LibreOffice
Online how Collabora solves these problems, and how you can get it
in the CODE project. Also catch up with the latest and greatest
feature/function improvements coming in LibreOffice 5.1 - our annual
FOSDEM release, and find out how you can best get involved with
LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY
Open source mapping tools are revolutionizing disaster preparedness and response around the world. After the Nepal Earthquake in 2015, more than 7000 contributors came together using open source tools such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's Tasking Manager to make more than 13 million edits to OpenStreetMap in the first two weeks after the earthquake. These tools are also empowering communities and international NGOs such as the American Red Cross and Medicins Sans Frontiers to map vulnerable areas before disasters occur. Using the power of the crowd, over 4000 "Missing Maps" volunteers have now put an area where 7.5 million people live onto OpenStreetMap for the first time. These efforts, powered by open source tools, are having real life saving impact and been credited for helping stop the spread of Ebola (http://www.fastcolabs.com/3037350/elasticity/inside-the-crowdsourced-map-project-that-is-helping-contain-the-ebola-epidemic) and improving the Nepal Earthquake response (http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-04/28/mapping-nepal-after-the-earthquake)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOPICS COVERED
This main track presentation will cover these tools and the people and processes that make them successful. Specifically, the presentation will discuss the impact that three open source tools are making:&lt;/p&gt;

OSM Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team collaborative mapping. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.
This approach facilitates the distribution of tasks to the various mappers in a context of emergency. It also permits to control the progress and the homogeinity of the work done (ie. Elements to cover, specific tags to use, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) OpenStreetMap Export Tool (export.hotosm.org)
The OSM Export Tool makes it possible for humanitarian response organizations to easily export maps and data from OSM for use on smartphones and GPS devices prior to deploying to the field. The exports have been credited with aiding search and rescue efforts in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) OpenAerialMap (beta.openaerialmap.org)
After a disaster, satellite and drone imagery is critical to helping map affected areas, identify damage, and map displaced persons camps. While much imagery is made available for free, until now there has been no central place for search and access it. OpenAerialMap provides the first completely open imagery platform and network for aerial imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT
The presentation will utilize mixed media (audio, visual, short film clips) to demonstrate the power of open source technology for disaster response. In addition to a lecture, short demonstrations of the tools will be given so that audience members can see live disaster mapping in action.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free communications with Free Software</title>
        <subtitle>Is there any credible way to build a trustworthy communications platform without using free software?</subtitle>
        <track>Communications</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At FOSDEM 2013, leading developers of free real-time communications software dared to get up on stage and ask the question "Can we replace Skype, Viber, Twitter and Facebook?".  Was this the right question and how does it relate to free software development today and in the future?  Pocock talks about what has changed since then and where things are going in this domain in the year ahead, especially with the emergence of WebRTC and the ubiquity of browsers that support it and the opportunities this has created for the world of web development and interaction with other open systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine a world where phone communication works with all the benefits of email (but without spam)?  Per-minute charges eliminated, flexibility for developers to customize the experience with standard scripting languages like Python or JavaScript and organizations of any size able to assert their identity and brand securely using SIP and XMPP addresses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a worthwhile vision?  What do each of us - developers, sysadmins and end users - need to do to make it happen?  What will be the alternative outcome - for both society in general and fans of free technology in particular - if we stand back and allow proprietary solutions to run rampant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will survey some of the free software solutions that exist today and ways you can participate in their improvement and deployment to help realize this vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Building a peer-to-peer network for Real-Time Communication</title>
        <subtitle>Can a true peer-to-peer architecture, with no central point of control, be a universal and secure solution?</subtitle>
        <track>Communications</track>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ring.cx/en/documentation/about-ring"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a new project from &lt;a href="http://www.savoirfairelinux.org/"&gt;Savoir-faire Linux&lt;/a&gt;, creators of SFLphone, uses a distributed hash table instead of a central SIP server to find other users. This peer-to-peer network is also accessible from other applications using the project's &lt;a href="https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht"&gt;OpenDHT&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Signaling protocols, like SIP, XMPP and IAX, typically rely on central servers to help users locate each other and initiate sessions. &lt;a href="http://ring.cx"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the &lt;a href="https://blog.savoirfairelinux.com/en/2015/ring-opendht-a-distributed-hash-table/"&gt;OpenDHT&lt;/a&gt; library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ring and OpenDHT's developers explain how the peer-to-peer network is built. They explain the difficulties encountered and solutions found for typical and specific problems. The talk goes beyond traditional telephony to look at Ring and OpenDHT's potential in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things"&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a demonstration of the Ring solution and the following questions are explored:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A layered architecture - which one and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do developers need to know about the OpenDHT library?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to adapt SIP protocol for use on a peer-to-peer network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the practical use cases for this type of RTC in the Internet of Things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can people collaborate with the Ring developers and their workflow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A hands on demo of the types of containers that can be brought up in Linux using only the existing distribution tools&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the theory of what containers are and how they work in Linux, including why they differ from hypervisors and what specific properties they have.  In the demo section we will get into how you actually create and attach individual namespaces and cgroups (with simple demonstrations of the user namespace and the freezer cgroup using the unshare command and /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer).  Finally we'll end up with a demonstration of how to bridge two network namespaces with a veth pair and how the ip netns command works&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we'll look beyond container orchestration with Kubernetes, but also demonstrate its failure handling by pulling the plugs on random nodes from a Raspberry Pi computing cluster:
 - Overview of Kubernetes
 - Process resource isolation to prevent a run-away process affecting another
 - Use Replication controller to ensure a crashed process is restarted
 - Who wants to pull a network or power plug from a computing cluster?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Live Migration of Virtual Machines From the Bottom Up</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Virtualisation</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hypervisors get deployed in wildly different scenarios: datacenters are different from clouds, and both of these are different from the way we use virtualization on our workstations or laptops.  This has resulted in the different projects using a layered approach, which makes everything modular, but prone to a lot of mismatches and errors.  Effort has been ongoing on making these layers behave as a cohesive whole, while addressing the usecases and demands from the various deployment scenarios in a way that scales well.  This talk will be focussed on the live migration aspect of virtualization, showcasing some of the usecases, and actual problems that have been solved while keeping all the usecases in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtualization is now commonplace, and the focus has shifted from hypervisors to the various usecases of virtualization.  OpenStack, oVirt, virt-manager all use the hypervisor and various virtualization capabilities to varying extents, and in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For oVirt and OpenStack, there are several layers involved in the making of the projects -- Linux, KVM, QEMU, libvirt, and project-specific layers on top like oVirt node and OpenStack Nova.  Interactions between these layers is tricky and complicated.  Work has been ongoing in bridging gaps between the communities from these projects, and forming a cohesive whole rather than being a bag of parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is from the perspective of a QEMU developer, from the low levels of the complete system showcasing the challenges faced and new additions that benefit the higher layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some surprising results, like older QEMU versions successfully migrate modern workloads whereas newer ones could not.  Modern VMs, which have several vCPUs and lots of RAM make live migration very interesting.  One solution may not fit all use-cases, so several ways of attacking various problems have to be thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will go through the various scenarios in which hypervisors get deployed, and the different expectations from higher layers of the stack.  Some prickly problems that have shown up will be discussed, along with the solutions that have been engineered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Baobáxia - the Galaxy of Baobab Trees</title>
        <subtitle>Connecting off-line Afro-Brazilian communities with free software</subtitle>
        <track>Miscellaneous</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Baobáxia is a community-built project to connect about 200 Brazilian quilombos to assist the interchange and preservation of traditional, community-built culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special challenge is found in the fact that many of these communities are located in remote areas with no access to the Internet. It is therefore imperative to be able to synchronize multimedia data offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, the system uses git-annex to solve the challenging problem of offline distribution - but the really important part of the process is the community effort involved.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Rede Mocambos is a network of about 200 Afro-Brazilian and indigenous communities. As a network, it is focused on creating new infrastructure and strengthening the communities through the use of free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baobáxia is a system designed to unite these communities in an offline network. Each community will upload their local cultural production (in the form of documents and multimedia content) to their local node of the system and have their contributions synchronized to the rest of the network. Nodes with an internet connection can synchronize directly from other nodes on the internet, while offline communities can synchronize their contents during the frequent meetups and visits with other communities in the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baobáxias purpose is to provide traditional communities with the infrastructure to create and preserve their own digital culture on their own terms. The offline distribution is very important as many of these communities will probably never have fast Internet access due to their geographical location, but the creation of a free and community operated infrastructure for sharing multimedia data may also be seen as an important alternative to centralized global monopolies as YouTube and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system has now been operating for about a year and currently contains 30 nodes corresponding to about 20 different local communities. The project's efforts are currently directed at consolidating the current features, planning new features for future releases and giving workshops for users and administrators in the communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, the system is built in Python and Django, with a front end based on Java Script and uses git and git-annex to synchronize the media. The important part of the process, however, is the community building aspect. Baobáxia represents the hope for the digital future for an existing network of ~200 traditional communities which are already keen on using free software and free technology to propagate and develop their culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A New Patchwork</title>
        <subtitle>Bringing CI, patch tracking and more to the Mailing List</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mailing lists are the bedrock of many open source software projects, and have been so since the early days of the Internet. However, mailing lists can struggle to compete with code collaboration tools like Gerrit and Rietveld, many of which offer features such as integration with automated testing tools and patch tracking. How can such features be integrated into existing, mailing list-based projects like the Linux kernel or DPDK? The presenter reports on the ongoing work around the widely-deployed 'patchwork' tool to do just this.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tracking of patches between development mailing lists and automated testing tools can be accomplished using &lt;a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/"&gt;patchwork&lt;/a&gt;. patchwork provides a web interface for patches submitted to mailing lists and presents them alongside any comments. patchwork also supports the tracking of the state of patches, be they Accepted, Rejected or Under Review. By design, patchwork is not intended to replace mailing lists but rather supplement them: these features are entirely optional, but where used can help ease the burden on maintainers by removing the need to perform tedious, time-consuming and low-value tasks like manual sorting. patchwork is already widely deployed for many projects, and instances can be found on &lt;a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/"&gt;kernel.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dpdk.org/dev/patchwork"&gt;dpdk.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://patchwork.openembedded.org/"&gt;openembedded.org&lt;/a&gt;, to name but a few. There are also many projects, including Open vSwitch and QEMU, that can be found on &lt;a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/"&gt;ozlabs.org&lt;/a&gt;, which is maintained by the original author of patchwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk outlines the ongoing work to supplement development mailing lists with web-based workflows using patchwork. We demonstrate how features such as continuous integration support, automated patch and series tracking and a vastly expanded API help position the combination of the Mailing List and patchwork as a viable, feature-competitive alternative to tools such as Gerrit or Rietveld. We also detail some of the complexities of structuring the inherently unstructured data found on mailing lists. How do I identify a series of patches, for example? How do identify a reply to a patch? How do I identify a patch itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk be of particular interest to testers of open source, mailing list-based projects such as the Linux kernel, QEMU, DPDK or Open vSwitch. These users will be able take advantage of features like support for continuous integration servers and series tracking to develop automated, distributed testing infrastructures. Communities like OpenStack &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/interview-openstack-ci-test-automation"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that such infrastructures are critical for delivering software faster while reducing risk and maintenance cost. Such an infrastructure is currently being developed for the DPDK community, and it is easy to envision a similar roll-out for other projects with &lt;a href="https://github.com/famz/patchew"&gt;similar requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also be of interest to the developers of these projects. These developers can already use patchwork as a tool to track patch backlogs, maintain personal &lt;em&gt;TODO&lt;/em&gt; lists, or just browse submissions via a web UI/XML-RPC API. However, the new features provide these users with functionality that can help automate even more of the tedious yet necessary &lt;em&gt;overhead&lt;/em&gt; tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Buildtime Trend : visualise what's trending in your build process</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in gaining some insight in the running time of the build process of your project? Buildtime Trend is an Open Source application that collects timing data from a build process, currently Travis CI, and uses this to create charts to visualise trends of what's happening during a build.
We'll explain how it works, and how you can set it up for your project, concluding with a demo that shows the charts and metrics on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Buildtime Trend project started in an urge to find the cause of an unstable build process. A first version was a collection of Python and Bash scripts that generated timing data and produce a simple chart showing duration of different parts of a build process.
In the last few months these simple scripts have evolved into a Heroku hosted service that gets timing data from the log file of Travis CI build job. The service is automatically triggered when a build is finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing data that is gathered by the service is used in a dashboard with a series of charts and metrics. It shows data like build time duration, failed and successful builds. It is also possible to select different timeframes, and to filter on specific build job parameters like branch name and language version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the service can process Travis CI build logs, but in the future, other CI platforms will be supported as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Learning about software development with Kibana dashboards</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you have 15 minutes, in this talk you can learn how to explore data from git or Gerrit repositories, using a Kibana-based dashboard. The talk will explain how to retrieve the data from the repositories, how to visualize different aspects of it, and how to produce a dashboard with those visualization. The dashboard, once composed, allows for selective filtering, drilling-down, and in general, knowing about the internals of a free, open source software project at any level of detail. Is there a better way of spending 15 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Free, open source software (FOSS) projects with an open development model offer a great deal of data in their public development repositories. Among them, git and Gerrit are some of the most common. That data can be retrieved and analyzed to learn about how the project is working. Who is contributing, who is reviewing code, how much time they spend in code review, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an arcane art, analyzing these repositories is today becoming more and more easy for anyone. In this talk, I will show how the data can be extracted from the repositories, and how once it is stored in a database, it can be easily analyzed. As an example, ElasticSearch will be used as database, and Kibana as the tool to produce analytics dashboards. Both are FOSS products, easy to install, which allows anyone, even with basic skills, to reproduce the procedure presented in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when the procedure is simple, and the tools used in it are FOSS and readily available, the dashboards produced are rich, and allow for detailed drill down. Some examples of the dashboards that can be produced are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some more information about how to use and produce these dashboards can be found in the Bitergia blog, http://blog.bitergia.com.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;coala is an application that makes it very easy, writing analysis for any programming language or even arbitrary textual data. It is a useful abstraction that provides a convenient user interface and takes away a lot of common tasks from the algorithm developer, effectively making bare research available for production use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk features a short introduction into the thoughts behind coala, it's ability to speed up research as well as increase productivity and of course a demonstration of our command line and other interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>How choosing the Raft consensus algorithm saved us 3 months of development time</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Providing full data availability in a degraded cluster requires
a mechanism for coordinating changes to cluster membership in an automated way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing our GPL distributed storage solution we researched
the state of the art of consensus algorithms to achieve fault-tolerance.
Our first stop was Paxos, which turned out to be complex and lacking accurate and comprehensive
specifications. Without a reference implementation, confusion reigns supreme, and
analyzing all the different variants would have taken us at least 3 months.
By contrast Raft defines a single clean way to implement reliable leader
election. It controls responsiveness with autonomously made decisions of
participation in the cluster, while providing data availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk I will recount the road bumps we hit while implementing
the consensus algorithm and the headaches we had before we ditched Paxos.
With this head start on Raft, I hope to save my fellow developers from the pain
we went through!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Filesystem encryption has been readily available since the dawn
of times, but it still requires external software to protect against
data loss.
Many users rely on proprietary cloud storage clients (like Dropbox) to
synchronize their encrypted data across multiple devices.
SXFS is a GPL licensed FUSE-based filesystem for Linux and OSX, which features
client-side encryption (AES256), horizontal scalability and
fault-tolerance out of the box.
With just two commands you create and mount a fully deniable network
storage which keeps your data safe from prying eyes.
In this lightning talk I will demonstrate how to get SXFS up and running
and how easy it is to maintain and scale out.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Spiffing - Military grade security</title>
        <subtitle>No, really this time.</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Spiffing is a modern C++ MIT-licensed library for handling machine-readable security labels, of the type used by military, government, and intelligence systems throughout the world. Ever wanted to understand those "TOP SAUSAGE SIGINT RODEO" things you see in the news? Come along and find out.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This lightning talk is not classified, but if it were, Spiffing could tell you not only what classification it was, but what categories were used as well, how to represent that as text and colour, and who would be allowed to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques have been the cornerstone of "multi-level security", the gold standard for high-security systems, for the past three decades, but the specifications are hard to find, often not public, and up until now there have been no freely available implementations. This has limited not only the use of open-source within high-security markets, but also the use of these very useful security practises throughout industry. Spiffing opens this technology to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give a crash-dive into what a security label really is, how clearances work, what a security policy is and how it's represented, and what Spiffing can do with them. I'll end with a rapid demo, showing a secure collaboration system built on open-source, that I'll be showing in more detail in the Real-time Lounge throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Layers Box</title>
        <subtitle>Private cloud made easy</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using cloud providers to run business-critical software is not an option for many small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and worldwide. Also private users are increasingly aware of the privacy risks when relying on the services of big enterprises. Running your own server is often considered "geeky", with only nerds being able to do administrate a server. We want to change that! Our Open Source "Layers Box" is an infrastructure for creating, installing and running packages of inter-dependent self-hosted services on own hardware. We would like to present our approach and inspire the Lightning Talk audience to discuss possible additional use cases and services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In our European research project, we currently aim to find solutions for scaling informal learning at the workplace, that is all learning that happens e.g. through videos at a construction site. Many of our pilot companies in construction are willing to provide content like tutorials of new materials, but they are afraid to lose rights on their material when uploading it "to the cloud". Often, a lot of intellectual property is recorded as well that needs to be filtered before releasing. On the other hand, in our healthcare pilots, many practices are simply not allowed to use cloud services with health data due to governmental regulation. Thus driven by recent trends such as microservices, micro data centers, DevOps and HTML5 Web applications, we created a stack called "Layers Box". First, it is a piece of Python-based software that basically works the same as npm or bower, except that you install whole services like ownCloud as Linux containers (with Docker). Second, it is a packaging infrastructure with some ready-made pre-configured services. For example, we provide packages for OpenLDAP, Open ID Connect and self-service tools for managing accounts. Through "action" triggers, we take care of prerequisites like creating databases or OpenID Connect/OAuth2 clients. All is served with a https-only reverse proxy in front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concretely, to set up e.g. ownCloud, you would need to type on the command line
layersbox init
layersbox install openldap
layersbox install openidconnect
layersbox install owncloud
The result will be a server where all the software mentioned above are installed and ready to be used after creating an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Lightning Talk, we would like to present our ongoing efforts and give an outlook on work we plan in the future, like a Web-based graphical interface. And of course we aim to make it even easier for companies and private users to install your own Layers Box - to keep your data safely within your own premises using Open Source tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is available at
https://github.com/learning-layers/LayersBox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a large-scale European research project with 17 partners. Our research group therein is located at RWTH Aachen University&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>FAI - The Universal Installation Tool</title>
        <subtitle>Why FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) is the perfect Tool for provisioning bare-metal, VM, chroots and Live CDs</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A short demo will show the features of FAI 5.0, which was released in nov 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FAI, the Fully Automatic Installation is a network installation
system for the installation and configuration of the operation system
and all your applications on all your hosts. The whole installation
only takes a few minutes without any interaction necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAI project startet in 1999 as a bare metal provisioning tool for
Debian GNU/Linux only. Today it's also used for deploying different
Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, Scientific Linux or Suse on
real hardware or virtual hosts. For FAI there's no difference in

environment or creating a Live CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In nov 2015 FAI 5.0 was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short demo will show why FAI is the universal deployment tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A flexible DNSSEC-validating Resolver</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Knot DNS Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation written in C and LuaJIT, including both a resolver library and a daemon. Modular architecture of the library keeps the core tiny and efficient, and provides a state-machine like API for extensions. There are three built-in modules - iterator, cache, validator, and many external.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lua modules, switchable and shareable cache, and fast FFI bindings makes it great to tap into resolution process, or be used for your recursive DNS service. It's the OpenResty of DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server adopts a different scaling strategy than the rest of the DNS recursors - no threading, shared-nothing architecture (except MVCC cache that may be shared). You can start and stop additional nodes depending on the contention without downtime.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Going cross-platform - how htop was made portable</title>
        <subtitle>Converting the process manager htop from being Linux-only into a portable application</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The story of how htop, a popular interactive process manager, went from being a Linux-only application into a portable one. In this talk I will discuss the technical approaches taken in porting process, the design choices that went into it, and also a bit of the backstory on how and why this conversion came to be.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;htop is a popular text-mode process manager, originally written for Linux. Its original mission was to "aim to be a better top".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, it remained as a Linux-only application, because, while the UI was dependent only on the portable library ncurses, the entire logic for gathering process data was based on the /proc filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of free software, this didn't stop enterprising users from porting it to different platforms, so htop ran, at different capacities, on FreeBSD (using a Linux procfs emulation layer) and Mac OS X, via an ad-hoc port that was never integrated back upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until 2015 that the htop codebase was made truly portable. In this talk, I will discuss how and why that happened, and talk about the challenges and design decisions involved. I will focus on the technical process, but I will also touch on the positive social impact to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the speaker: Hisham Muhammad is the original author of htop, a project started in 2004. Hisham is also the lead developer of LuaRocks, the package manager for the Lua language and a co-founder of the GoboLinux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Parallels between GPL/copyrights and secure patent behaviour</title>
        <subtitle>Practical response to software patent lawsuits threats - community mutual protection</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will draw parallels between the copyright challenge at the dawn of the free and open innovation, and the new challenge of patent aggression being faced by the creative community nowadays.
Same as GPL, Copyleft, Afero and BSD-license were for the copyright hygiene, the OIN license is for software patent hygiene. Open Invention Network as a practical response to patent lawsuits threats.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There were times when avant-garde projects and innovative companies had problems with copyrights. These problems were mainly solved by introducing public copyright licenses, which helped to create safer and more accommodative environment around free and open software and other open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since some years innovators face patent lawsuits, which result from misuse of the outdated and often counter-productive patent system. Because of this system virtually all the innovation became a legal jungle where creators can be attacked from behind of any tiny tree by trolls or other warmongers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is just hating them and rejecting the whole notion of patent is a solution to this problem? Could a peaceful prayer ever stop aggression? No even handful examples of this in the human history.
Can an armed collective organise its own defence and stop aggression? More likely than not. Even showing off your defensive weapons may prevent aggression without fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the idea behind Open Invention Network - a collective patent defence system with the biggest defensive patent pool.
One may see it as a fortress in a hostile woods full of trolls. Everybody who does not want to be attacked and wants to be protected is welcome. With a weapon or without, big or small, commercial or non-profit. If one does not have a weapon, he brings a brick with him - his voice against aggression, which entrenches the walls of the fort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No costs, no strings attached. You are welcome if you only pledge patent non-aggression towards other members around Linux. Only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how this patent aggression challenge being addressed by the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A haskell-based web platform designed to sustainably fund sharable, freely-licensed projects</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Snowdrift.coop is a web platform for fundraising and supporting free/libre/open projects. We are tackling the 'snowdrift dilemma' that limits contributions to non-rivalrous goods such as open-source software. The organization is a non-profit multi-stakeholder cooperative, and all code is available under OSI and FSF approved licenses.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a couple years of prototyping and experimentation (live on the main website), we have recently focused on three main areas: (1) opening the project to greater participation through code refactoring and tool development, (2) firming up the co-op governance structure, and (3) creating a comprehensive design framework for the website. There is also plenty of ongoing feature development on various aspects of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding mechanism is not yet functional but progressing. Once functional, Snowdrift.coop itself will be a supported project, and should prove to be an excellent test-case for the adoption and success of the concept. In the meanwhile, we are actively looking for ways to improve both productivity and opportunities for our distributed team of volunteers. Experienced Haskellers are invited to mentor volunteers, take ownership of component libraries, and provide opinions and insights. New Haskellers---not to mention designers, writers, economists, legal professionals, or anyone else philosophically inclined to our mission of freeing the commons---are especially welcome; we pride ourselves on being inclusive and approachable by (non-)programmers at any level of technical sophistication!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the Unix operating system is made available as a version-control repository, covering the period from its inception in 1972 as a five thousand line kernel, to 2015 as a widely-used 26 million line system.  The repository contains 659 thousand commits and 2306 merges.  The repository employs the commonly used Git system for its storage, and is hosted on the popular GitHub archive.  It has been created by synthesizing with custom software 24 snapshots of systems developed at Bell Labs, Berkeley University, and the 386BSD team, two legacy repositories, and the modern repository of the open source FreeBSD system.  In total, 850 individual contributors are identified, the early ones through primary research.  The data set can be used for empirical research in software engineering, information systems, and software archaeology.  Community contributions to improve the included data and extend the covered systems are more than welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EU-FOSSA: Pilot Project for auditing of Open Source Software at the European Institutions&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent discoveries of vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure have drawn the broader public's attention to the need to understand how governance and quality of the underlying software code relates to basic safety and public trust in applications that are used on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this presentation we would like to bring your attention to an ongoing pilot project looking for a systematic approach towards ensuring that widely used critical software can be trusted.
This project has been conceived at the European Parliament and entrusted for execution to the European Commission, with a total budget of 1 million euro. If it proves to be successful, it might become a permanent action of the European Institutions during the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been conceived in three parts:
– Comparative study of the European Institutions' and open source communities’ software development practices and a feasibility study of performing a code review of open source projects for European Institutions.
– Definition of a unified methodology to obtain complete inventory of open source software and technical specifications used within the European Parliament and the European Commission and the actual collection of data.
– Exemplary code review of selected open source software and/or library, particularly targeting software considered critical, that is exploitation of which could lead to a severe disruption of public or EU services and/or unauthorised access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will focus on areas where collaboration with the open source communities is crucial and where we might be looking for exchange of ideas or direct involvement in the project's execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>OSCAR: Address the new challenges of open-source software quality</title>
        <subtitle>A new capability model and a quality assessment platform for open source projects</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightningtalk</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk, we would like to share our experience, vision and methodology regarding today's challenge of improving the quality of open source software.
With the increasing success of OSS software and in parallel the advent of OSS quality failures such as Heartbleed, the interest for the models and tools able to measure and improve the quality of open-source software is growing.
This presentation will introduce:
- the OSCAR model, a new quality model for assessing open-source software (OSCAR stands for Open-source Sofware Capability Assessment Round-up), sustained by the OW2 Consortium. We will explain how it differs from other models and we will present the model's status and roadmap.
- the OSCAR platform, an open-source umbrella project implementing the OSCAR model by combining several open-source quality tools such as SonarQube, Fossology, ScanCode, Spago4Q, and outcomes from the RISCOSS European collaborative project. We will show how this platform is used for continously assessing the quality of the OW2 projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this lightning talk, we would like to share our experience, vision and methodology regarding today's challenge of improving the quality of open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software is eating the world and open source licenses are eating software. This leads to the presence of OSS in nearly all the electronic systems we interact with daily, such as communication devices, cars, trains, healthcare systems, entertainment environments. This entails that the quality of the OSS components we use and produce is getting progressively as important as the quality of the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increasing success of OSS software and in parallel the advent of OSS quality failures such as Heartbleed, the interest for the models and tools able to measure and improve the quality of open-source software is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inpsired by, among others, the SEI Capability Maturity Model, several models and tools have been created in the last 20 years for describing and analyzing the quality of open-source software. These models aim at capturing both the general software engineering quality drivers of the analysed projects, and more specifically their open-source related aspects, that is in particular their governance (IP and community management), their openness and activeness levels, their compliance with standards. Among the most well-known initiatives: the Qualipso Open Maturity Model, the Qualification and Selection of Open Source software methodology, the Software Sustainability Maturity Model (OSS Watch), the NASA Reuse Readiness Levels, the PolarSys Maturity Assessment model. More recenlty, the Linux Foundation has launched the "Badge Program" project for drafting a new quality model for open-source software. Simultaneously, the growing number of companies developing a business in assessing the quality and the vulnerabilities of OSS shows the importance of the topic for the whole economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing models raise several questions:
- first of all, theses models do not always follow the same pace as the IT world: several models were drafted in a pre-cloud, pre-devops, pre-heartbleed area and do not cover important aspects of modern OSS such as the ability to deploy easily a project into one or several cloud environments.
- second, the models generally do not provide a reference implementation for feeding the data with open-source software and for providing both high-level and detailed quality analysis.
- third, while it's easy to get a general consensus on software quality, divergences can appear when going into the details and attributing weights to the criteria, hence a need for a flexible model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lightning talk will introduce:
- the OSCAR model, a new quality model for assessing open-source software (OSCAR stands for Open-source Sofware Capability Assessment Round-up), sustained by the OW2 Consortium. We will explain how it differs from other models and we will present the model's status and roadmap.
- the OSCAR platform, an open-source umbrella project implementing the OSCAR model by combining several open-source quality tools such as SonarQube, Fossology, ScanCode, Spago4Q, and outcomes from the RISCOSS European collaborative project. We will show how this platform is used for continously assessing the quality of the OW2 projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Creating Augmented reality costume: concepts, tools, decisions, failures</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality is not a new technology, but still impress people, when they see 3D person rising out of the paper.
What about Augmented reality costume? Do you want to make one for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentation will go through augmented reality technologies (in particular: computer vision and 3D graphics),
showing, what it is really like to make augmented reality based product: what tools to use, what concepts you need to know to make design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There was Christmas party in my company with dress code: future. So I decided, that realistic future is not physical cloths of Storm trouper from StarWars, but cloths designed for Augmented reality.
Initial idea was to create full blown Augmented reality costume, but with current deadlines and available technologies results was: Android app, that will put Storm trouper helmet only on me
and some smaller 3D models when you look closer into the T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I created end-to-end Augmented reality product and have some practical experience to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology stack was fully Open Source or free: ARToolKit, Blender, AndoridSDK, InkScape (little OpenCV for presentation purpose only).
Presentation will not be only a list of technologies, but more like: concepts and how they influenced various decisions in making final product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this session I will walk you through how to build your own retro handheld console that is powered by Java, runs on a Raspberry Pi, and is printed on a 3D printer.  Some of the topics that we will cover along the journey include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacking Java on the Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rigging input devices with Pi4J&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insane performance tuning on the JVM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why your boss [or SO] needs to buy you a 3D printer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And of course your retro gaming mettle will be put to the test, so make sure to dust off your old 8 and 16 bit consoles to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation is about the most fun you can have while still legitimately calling this conference “work.”  In fact, I will hopefully inspire you to do your own creative “work” leveraging Java and Raspberry Pi to hack the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Late last year we have integrated JEP 243 into the JDK 9 repositories.  This is something
completely new to the JVM:  a Java interface which is part of the JVM.  In this case it is
a Compiler Interface (CI) which can be used to plug in JIT compilers written in Java.&lt;br/&gt;
I will talk a bit about how it works, what it can be used for and what Oracle is using it for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;JRuby has for years routed around the JVM, to maximize compatibility
with standard Ruby. We've implemented byte[]-based String and Regexp,
native POSIX support, and our own mixed-mode interpreting/jitting
runtime atop JVM bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With JRuby 9000, we're taking this even further. JRuby 9000 introduces
a new IR-based optimizing compiler, with inlining, specialization, and
other tricks applied to both interpreted and bytecode-compiled code.
We've also gone fully native for much of IO and Process management.
This talk will show the state of this work and how it affects JRuby
and the wider JVM world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenJDK is now a well established Free Software Ecosystem, with a
vibrant Community and lots of interesting stuff going on, with
projects, repositories, bug database and above all experiments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exciting and fun, but given the challenges of such massive
project, it is intimidating and it is easy to get lost. It is also
easy to forget that such massive infrastructure requires well defined
rules, that are sometime perceived as blocking rather than aiding the
participation. To help people wanting to contribute keep track of this
intricate forest of development and find their way in, the Adoption
Group was created (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session is an exchange between few of the hackers directly
involved with the Adoption Group and the public, we will answer
questions the audience may have in relation to getting involved with
OpenJDK, try to define and explain workarounds for most common
problems (and blockers!) that newcomers face, discuss some of the
projects we are currently involved with, and hope to be your Ariadne's
thread to win back the fun of contributing and participating at all
levels, without ever getting lost!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;etcd is an open source distributed consistent key-value store written in Go. It has become a mature cornerstone of a variety of distributed systems for networking, service discovery, configuration management and load balancing. This talk will describe etcd, its history, its new V3 API, and some of its production use cases. It will also dive into some of the ups and downs of using Go to develop software that powers some of the most reliable distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to run resilient, hyperscale infrastructure today means running it in a distributed way. But building distributed systems is complex and can be a challenge because one of the essential elements includes removing any single point of failure. The answer? Powering these systems with a reliable, distributed database, designed to ensure your infrastructure stays up and running even when individual servers fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etcd is an open source distributed consistent key-value store written in Go that was introduced by the team at CoreOS. Since its release in 2013 it has become a mature cornerstone of a variety of distributed systems for doing networking, service discovery, configuration management and load balancing. This talk will describe etcd, its history, its new V3 API, and some of its production use cases. It will also dive into some of the ups and downs of using Go to develop software that powers some of the most reliable distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a language, specially a relatively new language, for a project can be a challenge.  Does it have enough documentation?  Is it interpreted or compiled to machine language?  How easily can it be built?  How can it be tested?  What libraries are available?  These and other question like them are always asked by developers when confronting a new language for a project.  In this talk we will be discussing the experiences learned while researching, designing, developing, and deploying project Heketi, a RESTful service used to intelligently allocate volumes in GlusterFS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover important experiences learned at each stage of development of project Heketi[1].  We will be discussing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* Project Infrastructure: Builds, Testing, Utilities
* REST Application development with middleware support
* Concurrency and asynchronous request models
* Database management
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many people use Go for different projects: WebDev, DevOps or other general-purpose tasks. On another hand,  with all the beauty and performance of the language it could be a good challenger for Data applications.
In the talk, we will go through the common problems of Data Engineering. Starting with high-performance caching and probabilistic data structures like Bloom filters, CountMin or Hyperloglog. We will cover all stages of Data Pipelining like writing data producers for open source Apache Kafka or proprietary Amazon Kinesis or Google Pub/Sub with further data consuming and processing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learn about debugging Go programs from the creator of Delve: a debugger for the Go programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging programs can be extremely difficult. Start mixing in massive parallelism and the task quickly devolves into a frustrating exercise that challenges your patience and sanity. During the course of this talk I will show how Delve can take the pain out of debugging Go programs. Concretely, I will explain the problems Delve solves, and present the features unique to Delve.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Go programs can be very difficult to debug. During this talk I will explain why that is true, and in the process why I created Delve and how it makes debugging Go programs easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will begin by explaining why Go is difficult to debug, and why existing debuggers are incompatible with Go. Following that I will take a deep dive into Delve explaining how it works, and how it solves the problems discussed in the beginning of the talk. Following that I will launch into a demo, showing how to use Delve and how to leverage the specific features of Delve to debug Go programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at people of all skill levels. There will be several 'usage' examples that can benefit everyone, as well as very technical deep dives into Go and debuggers which will appeal to intermediate / advanced Go developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Go doesn't have native ability to create and use plugins during runtime. As of Go1.5, there are 2 ways of doing plugins.
1. Using inter-process communication and stand alone programs.
2. Using a scripting language and an embedded VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be discussing the pros and cons of each, and discuss how to implement both approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We all know how good horizontal scaling is. We also know that PHP is born single threaded, and therefore it’s not the best available tool for heavy processing or intensive batch jobs. In this talk we’ll see how to get through these shortcomings, achieving parallel processing through native solutions such as Process control functions and POSIX functions, but also exploiting more recent techniques such as message queues and nonblocking I/O. We’ll cover a wide range of examples from real world applications, and dealing with tools such as Gearman, RabbitMQ, ReactPHP and Icicle.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;So, you've been through and changed all your double quotes to single quotes but your application still isn't running at the speed of light. What's going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making an application scale is generally seen as something that only the most magical of developers can do, but it's easy once you have the correct tools. Fortunately for us, these tools are freely available online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll take a look at a few options that we have available to work out what our application is actually doing, help identify bottlenecks and fix them so that we can move on to the more important part of the project: delivering features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PSR-7 describes common interfaces for representing HTTP messages. HTTP messages are the foundation of web development. Web browsers and HTTP clients such as cURL create HTTP request messages that are sent to a web server, which provides an HTTP response message. Server-side code receives an HTTP request message, and returns an HTTP response message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain the interfaces defined by PSR-7, how they define the future of interoperability between frameworks and tools. After that there will be a showcase of several implementations and tools such as zend's diactoros package, Guzzle v6, php-http, RelayPHP and other packages that show the real power of shared interfaces for HTTP objects. A clear path to how we can start using these typed objects in our applications today will be shown.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Several migration frameworks and libraries have been created over the years in order to help developers manage their data and schema changes in a reliable, collaborative manner. But even well-adopted solutions like Phinx and Doctrine Migrations have either struggled to keep-up with modern PHP due to architectural issues, or failed to provide enough framework integration to be actually practical for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll guide you through Baleen: an open-source PHP framework that synthesizes the very core of the migrations mechanism into a “domain library”, which can be re-used to power migrations for virtually any modern PHP framework (not kidding!). I'll also reveal plans of re-building Doctrine Migrations using the Baleen framework. But most importantly, you'll see an example of how separating common logic into small domain models can help you invent and contribute relevant modules to the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When MongoDB and its PHP driver first appeared on the scene, the GoPHP5 movement was just winding down, PHP6 books were on the best-seller list, and developers were handling dependencies with a mix of PEAR and Git submodules. After six years, our beloved driver had become quite the complex, monolithic extension, and PHP 5.x was no longer the only platform on the block. With the goal of supporting multiple platforms (PHP 5.x, HHVM, and PHP 7) while still keeping our maintenance burden in check, we set out to create several new light-weight extensions and pushed all of those user-friendly, high-level APIs off to a single, supporting PHP library. This session will walk through our journey and provide a fresh look at the next-generation MongoDB driver for PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Unified Framework for Big Data Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW)</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of Foreign Data Wrappers in Postgres 9.1, access to distributed systems such as Hdfs, HBase, Hive with their multiple data formats is feasible.
However, the existing FDW implementations for Big Data systems, such as Hdfs or Hive, lack a few key features and doesn’t have a common framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PXF provides a unified extensible framework for accessing any distributed system data source. Existing plugins include loading and querying of data stored in HDFS, HBase and Hive. It supports a wide range of data formats such as Text, Avro, Sequence, Hive RCFile, ORC, Parquet and Avro formats and HBase. The pluggable framework makes it very convenient for adding new custom plugins. It also supports advanced statistics and filter pushdown.
PXF is an open source project and is currently being used by Apache HAWQ’s external table via PXF’s exposed REST API and is in the process of being integrated with other SQL engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the integration of PXF into Postgres FDW, we can achieve a single unified pluggable framework to read and write any distributed system data source. PXF also abstracts Postgres from any remote client dependencies and provides a clean installation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Postgresql's buffer manager has parts where it's showing its age. We'll discuss how it currently works, what problems there are, and what attempts are in progress to rectify these weaknesses:
* Lookups in the buffer cache are expensive
* The buffer mapping table is organized as a hash table, which makes efficient implementations of prefetching, write coalescing, dropping of cache contents hard
* Relation extension scales badly
* Cache replacement is inefficient
* Cache replacement replaces the wrong buffers&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The optimizer is the "brain" of the database, interpreting SQL queries and determining the fastest method of execution. This talk uses the explain command to show how the optimizer interprets queries and determines optimal execution. The talk will assist developers and administrators in understanding how Postgres optimally executes their queries and what steps they can take to understand and perhaps improve its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>UPSERT use cases</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>PostgreSQL</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 9.5 will have support for a feature that is popularly known as "UPSERT" - the ability to either insert or update a row according to whether an existing row with the same key exists. If such a row already exists, the implementation should update it. If not, a new row should be inserted. This is supported by way of a new high level syntax (a clause that extends the INSERT statement) that more or less relieves the application developer from having to give any thought to race conditions. This common operation for client applications is set to become far simpler and far less error-prone than legacy ad-hoc approaches to UPSERT involving subtransactions. Moreover, the new implementation performs much better than those legacy approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the feature is most obviously compelling for OLTP and web application use cases, it's also true that the syntax is powerful enough to be very useful in many real world data integration scenarios. The non-standard PostgreSQL syntax offer explicit, fine grained control over where and how to update. For example, an update may not actually affect an existing row due to not satisfying some additional criteria (i.e. due to not passing the ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE special, dedicated WHERE clause).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an overview of the feature from a high level, and examines these use cases. You will learn how you might want to use the new UPSERT feature in your application beyond the obvious. In passing, there will be brief discussion of why UPSERT's implementation proved to be a hard problem, and, relatedly, why a custom syntax was used instead of the SQL standard's MERGE syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the representation of objects in dynamically-typed languages like Ruby.
From the naive hash table used in ruby 1.8.7 to the highly optimized and type-specialized representation,
we will take a look at a few common representations for objects with a dynamic number of fields.
Advantages and drawbacks will be discussed and in particular the behavior of objects accessed concurrently.
Would you expect instance variables to disappear? Or that writing to them would have no effect?
If not, come and see why it could happen, and what can be done to fix it and at what cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JRuby+Truffle is a high performance implementation of Ruby being built as an open-source project at Oracle Labs.
It uses state-of-the-art research techniques for writing interpreters and dynamic compilers
that allows it to be both significantly faster and simpler than any other implementation of Ruby.
It is built on top the of Truffle framework which provide an Object Storage Model.
We present a solution to make it behave correctly under concurrent access.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how to use more than one of your cores?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will take you on a path of writing a simple concurrent class. We'll
start with a basic implementation and gradually improve it based on presented
problems and newly learned facts. Our final solution will behave well in the
face of concurrency and execute consistently on all Ruby implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll investigate various Ruby runtime differences that we’ve abstracted away
with the synchronization layer of the concurrent-ruby gem. We'll go down to
runtime internals, final fields, volatile fields and compare-and-swap

&lt;p&gt;In the end, after the problem domain is established, we'll discuss a
forming future direction of the Ruby language in parallel environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Every language community implements many of the same core components like garbage collection, just-in-time compilation, threading, tooling support, etc. Wouldn't it be great if there was an open source community making these technologies available to be used in all languages? This is exactly the goal of the OMR project: an open source project with reusable runtime technologies originating from the IBM J9  JVM representing hundreds of developer years of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk describes a set of experiments conducted by IBM to test the use of several OMR technologies within the Ruby MRI runtime: GC, JIT, method profiling, and more. All this while still running real Ruby applications, including Rails. The talk will include the results from our experiments and ideas about the future of Ruby and OMR.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Whether you are building a Robot, controlling a Radar, or creating a Web App, the Ruby Garbage Collector (GC) can help you. The stats exposed by the Garbage Collector since Ruby v2.1 caught my attention and pushed me to dig deeper. Both Ruby 2.1 and 2.2 brought great performance improvements. From a practical point of view, we will discuss how to use the GC to enhance significantly the performance of your software, from configuration parameters to different approaches on how you can change them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants his application to work faster. We use several tools to speed up our applications. I’ll tell you how to improve performance by using crystal extensions for Ruby. It’s pretty easy to replace slow parts of application like heavy calculations, and I’ll show you how.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Crystal is compiling to native code programming language. Crystal's authors say, it has ruby-inspired syntax. That’s why barriers to entry are very low for ruby developer. Sometimes when you look at the code you may ask yourself, what language do you see, is it Crystal or Ruby?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you about Crystal, similarities and differences from Ruby. And how to write Ruby extensions with Crystal to speed up your application. Don’t forget Crystal compiles to native code, so it uses less memory, CPU and it works several times faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Perl 6 is generating a lot of positive buzz. Envious of the awesome features in other languages? You'll likely find them in Perl 6. The Perl 6 developers took the time to carefully integrate features that developers actually need and they've created a language with a great balance between evolutionary and revolutionary. Come find out what the excitement is all about.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RPerl is the new optimizing compiler for Perl 5. Perl 11 is the philosophy of pluggability and the reunification of Perl 5 with Perl 6. We can currently use RPerl to speed up low-magic Perl 5 code with over 300x performance gain. This talk will discuss the future plans for supporting medium-magic and high-magic Perl 5 code, as well as Perl 6, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We'll start by demystifying Perl 6 regular expressions with some help from Perl5. From there we'll name the blocks that we've captured along the way, and refactor our regular expressions into Perl 6 rules and tokens. Those rules and tokens will combine to form a full Perl 6 grammar, and actions let us generate an abstract syntax tree directly from a bunch of little regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The best metaphor for Perl is and has been an onion.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;However, when we're teaching seminars or writing books, we mostly focus on one or two onion layers; those that concern syntax and grammar. Learning to program, learning to create applications, is so much more than focusing on how to get the syntax checker to not bail out when we put characters together, it's about creating efficient, effective and pretty applications that last and can continue development later on. So we have to change the way we teach Perl (and for that matter, every single language and stack in the world). I'll focus on what I think we should do, but we'll first have to see what we do (wrong) and how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Perl and Assembly language unexpectedly have a few things in common:
- Not very hip
- Dangerously permissive
- Magic variables! Sigisl (if you use AT&amp;amp;T syntax)
- Fun!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My aim is to show perl programmers that assembly language is no more complex than regular expressions, much more powerful, and intellectually interesting. To show sceptics that modern amd64 programming is not nearly as insane as they may have remembered x86 to be. And to show how to use assembly language from within perl6 programs. I will use a nontrivial example to show this, with assembly code and perl6 code that really runs.
My ulterior motive is to motivate and interest developers on working on MoarVM, its JIT compiler, and show them this stuff is not nearly as scare as one might think."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago (2013), in a galaxy far, far away (Orlando Perl Workshop) I gave a talk in which I declared Perl was not dead, but a dead end. The thesis of the talk being that the Perl 5 core was not a platform capable of change and the Perl 6 future was still to uncertain, so ... the only reasonable thing was to just rewrite it all in Scala!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the intervening years ... my rewrite stalled, I made peace with the Perl core, others attempted forks and rewrites (to varying degrees of success), and the Perl 6 Christmas finally came! In this talk we will reexamine the state of Perl in 2015 and discuss it's glorious future!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long beginning for Perl 6. Years of design, implementation, re-design, and re-implementation, left many wondering if the beginning would be eternal. They say in software you should plan to build one to throw away, because you will anyway. It turns out that "one" can be overly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, finally, we have reached the end of the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The point where the quest for the perfect Perl 6 has become the clear enemy of the really rather good Perl 6 we have. And, critically, the point where keeping Perl 6 user's production code working between releases will take a firm priority over language improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session I'll look back over my eight years of involvement in the Perl 6 project, share some of my favorite examples of Perl 6 code from my talks over the years (and probably some new ones), provide hints on how to dive into the language, and take a look at what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Arduboy feat. the Web: pocket-sized gamedev for everyone</title>
        <subtitle>Unleashing Arduboy games creation by building a Web IDE</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't like tiny handheld gaming devices that you could download free - or even, create your own - games for? The Arduboy is this exact device, low-cost, small and incredible fun to play with! Playing games is one thing though, so I set out on creating a Web IDE to make it even easier to make, hack, remix &amp;amp; share games with other Arduboy-fans!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Arduboy is a tiny pocket-size gaming device, based on the Arduino Leonardo, with some extra buttons, a screen and a buzzer - and the perfect platform to learn the ropes of both hardware hacking and games development in a fun &amp;amp; approachable way. To make games creation even easier, I've created an IDE, entirely based on web technologies, that helps lowering the entry barrier by making mundane and complicated stuff (such as creating and animating image sprites) a breeze on the Arduboy, putting the fun back into games creation and helping people get started with games creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be presenting the Arduboy and the open source beta Web IDE I've been working on that makes creating, flashing, sharing games a breeze!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll describe the DrawPlay technology, allowing anyone with the help of a camera and video projector to use drawings as an entry point for gameplay. We'll showcase how we based Flippaper on it and what we learn from our experience. We'll then finish by presenting the current dev state of our DIY kit which should allow an easier access to this technology to makers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At first there was the flippaper, a mix between a pinball machine and a drawing table. With the press of a magic SCAN button, whatever you would draw would be granted existence and light. Add to that a little ball projected on paper and you had all you need to draw mad graphic pinballs, play them, erase some part, add some new, play again, and repeat! The power of the underlying tech (paper and color based interaction) was too much for just two people, we felt the need to release it so others could play with it and express their own vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Bitbox is a 32-bit, minimalist (one-chip) opensource / open hardware, DIY-friendly retro game console aimed at tinkerers and lovers of low level hackers. Several Games have been made as well as programs for it and it sports a small but active community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year after the Bitbox presentation at Fosdem '15, what has changed, what was done and where is the project now aimed at ?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This quick talk will not go through how you can develop for the bitbox but will present you the project, why and how it's done from a hardware ad software point of view, new games and programs/ emulators, and finally some of the most recent projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bitbox console is a small open hardware &amp;amp; open source game console. The intent behind it is to make a fun little, open console that anyone can actually build, hack or modify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will present the rationale behind it and the current status of the project, and mostly focus on the new projects spawned from the community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A description of the console is available on its main blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blender is a well-known 3D modeling software. You may know as well that you can edit footage videos or develop interactive games within Blender. But thanks to its Python interface, you can actually do a lot more. In the end, you can export any data in any format, and connect to any remote tool. This talk presents some usage examples, among controlling a robot, exporting music tracks for a rhythm game, or designing HTML5 animations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>RedMetrics - Data-driven Game Design with Open Analytics</title>
        <subtitle>Know your players</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Game developers make heavy use of "metrics" in order to understand how their games are being played by the public. Through recording players' actions within a game, designers can identify weaknesses in the game design, such as sections of the game that are too difficult, or never explored. We have created an open source game analytics service called "RedMetrics" in which all data gathered is freely available online. RedMetrics can gather data from any platform (web, PC, console, etc.) and stores it an open repository. The data is available via a web API as well as a web application. To ease integration, we provide interfaces for the popular game engine Unity as well as for the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RedMetrics offers open source game analytics. It is made up of a RESTful web service and a web app that allows developers, teachers, and researchers to track game metrics, then download the raw data for offline analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it for your game, check out the RESTful web service API. If your game works in Unity, check out RedMetrics-Unity. If your game runs in a browser, you can use RedMetrics.js to connect it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Haxe : A language by gamedevs for gamedevs</title>
        <subtitle>Meet the indie OSS gamedev buddy!</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;These last years, game development have changed a lot, the proliferation of tools have made game creation way easier than before. Gamedev learning tools like Construct and Stencyl have made game development ubiquituous. But even if creating a simple game is no longer a challenge. These days there are so many options fo create your own games, even your own game engine. Then comes a big problem. Unplanned obsolescence. Every game engine dies. Every game engine that has its own crazy, crappy script variant, has its own API, its own tremors. And when it dies you might usually lose your rendering code, your shader infrastructure, your gameplay routines or your business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haxe tries to solve all these problems. It is not an engine, nor a framework. It is a language and a toolkit. Haxe compiles your code to every major languages used for game developments. Haxe pre-optimizes your code so that you focus on your game. Haxe does native compilation and allow you to bypass VM's. With its advanced type system and aggresive inlining, it can even allow jitted code to go faster than hand written code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you use Unity3D, Flash, Unreal, Haxe can bring you goodness and agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about OSS and Haxe a bit!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;0- OSS as a runtime...or not
I'll talk about how OSS is still a great way to have the right tools to build game but I'll also talk about how OSS games themselves seems stucked in a wrong mind set.
-- market structuration.
-- average revenue per user.
-- We need OSS game initiatives with fundings ( see https://pledgie.com/categories/games or itch.io).
-- Nobody owns Haxe and most of its framework are OSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- What is Haxe ?
I'll talk of the language itself and its features, I'll talk of what we do at Haxe foundation and what makes Haxe a powerful tool to every gamedev whatever his tastes in beer.
- A high level language.
- An optimising transpiler.
- A community.
- Nobody's ennemy : collaborate with your favorite runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- But pragmatically, when can Haxe help me?&lt;br/&gt;
I'll speak about the ecology of Haxe, how an awesome language also lead to a great ecosystem. I'll give away some pragmatic examples where Haxe can add ton of value to one's project.
- Unreal/Unity3d : inject external gameplay data, ubiquituous business logic
- HTML5 : gain optimisations and precompilation &amp;amp; client/server code sharing.
- Flash dying : backport your game to HTML5 or to cpp!
- Prototype in HTML5, run in cpp with Kha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3-Perspectives
- They use haxe
- What we did last year
- We are looking for a CEO
- How Haxe should grow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4- Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Science at home aims at involving citizens in the world of science. We are building a quantum computer, and invite the general public to help us, by playing our games.
 In that respect, We are a citizen science project. We are also working on initiatives that open some of the data we are gathering, and provide tools for citizens to perform their own scientific tasks on the data: formulate hypotheses, test correlations, and hopefully gain new insights. We call this citizen science 2.0.
I will describe the goals and vision of the Science at home project, the games we make, the data we gather, and the software we use.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Science at home project, we are building a quantum computer. This task involves a lot of very difficult optimisation problems in quantum physics, that we can only partially solve with AI and other traditional optimisation techniques. We have managed to express the problems as casual video games, playable by people with no knowledge of quantum physics. Now, with a team of student developers, scientists and game developers, we are working on making these games as fun and engaging as possible. We have found that the solutions created by the players, combined with solutions found by various optimisation techniques are better than what optimisation techniques can produce alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We have found that this massive parallelisation of problem solving, massively making use of many, many human minds combined produce impressive results. We believe there is a huge potential in this, also beyond quantum physics, and we want to tap into that. Our approach is to make our scientific games as engaging and fun as possible, and to make it very clear and very visible for the players how much they contribute, and how important their contributions are to our work. But this is still only citizen science in its infancy: We are asking our game players to help us with our research, and we're gamifying that help as best we can.
We want to take an extra step, and open more of our data for the end-users and invite them to formulate their own theories. We want to provide gamified research tools for the end users to use to formulate and test their own hypotheses, maybe even set up their own experiments.  We call this Citizen science 2.0: Where the citizen graduates from research assistant, to researcher.
My talk will introduce the science at home project overall, and discuss some of our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Bridging Games Engines and Distributed Control System Frameworks for Virtual Reality (VR) based scientific simulations</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this lecture some insight on the use of Game Engine based Virtual Reality (VR) simulations for the validation of mission critical Command, Control and Communication (C3) software systems will be provided.
Starting from the experience gained developing a VR simulation of a planetary exploration mission, where a C3 system prototype has been built on top of the Tango Distributed Control System (DCS) framework, we will present our plans on keep exploring the possibilities of using game engines for scientific simulations integrating them with DCS frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Crewed missions, such as planetary exploration, or urban search-and-rescue missions are characterized as complex and highly-demanding. The overall system supporting such missions must be able to integrate many modules, including sensors, graphical interfaces and navigation software. We will refer to this system as the Command, Control and Communication (C3) system.  In supporting crewed missions, C3 will be facing all the issues associated with monitoring, assessing, and controlling heterogeneous multi-component and multi-degree-of-freedom systems.
The Development, and much more the Testing and Validation of such a mission critical system will represent a major challenge and simulators can play an important role in this respect. In this scenario, the recent development such as virtual and augmented reality, has provided an effective and versatile way to implement such simulators.
In particular, Virtual Reality (VR) allows simulating environments that are not possible or very difficult to reproduce. The simulations that can be realized in VR environments allows also to avoid all the possible unsafe situations for the user.
In VR, a model of any future mission in an extreme simulated environment can be created. VR simulations are so flexible that specific and reiterated tests could be performed several times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Game Engines directly support more and more VR devices (such as VR Headsets or haptic sensors), thus allowing the implementation of Virtual Reality Simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C3 systems can be best developed using one of the common and standardized framework available on the well established and large domain of distributed network-based industrial control that we will refer as Distributed Control System (DCS). The services that constitute the core of most DCS frameworks are:
- Communication: allows for the components (control servers and clients) of the distributed system to communicate amongst themselves
- Online database: refers to the possibility to access online any data point of the DCS
- Configuration database: keeps and manages the configuration data
- Logging: collects the logs from all over the system and presents it to the operator
- Recording &amp;amp; Replay: recording of real-time data for offline analysis and/or tactical replay
In addition to these core services, DCS often rely on services such as Alarm Systems or Data Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communication service constitutes the foundations of a Framework and can be identified as a specific layer of software (middleware) between clients and control server processes. The Communication Middleware implements what can be referred to as a “Framework Software Bus”. All C3 applications use the Software Bus to communicate with each other and are oblivious to the underlying communications mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the possibility to integrate a C3 System with VR simulations imply being able to bridge a DCS Framework with a Game Engine. This bridging is mostly constituted by the implementation of the communication interface between the Game Engine and the Framework Software Bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, for the V-ERAS project (www.erasproject.org) we have bridged the Blender Game Engine with the Tango DCS Framework (www.tango-controls.org). Unfortunately the Blender Game Engine seems not mature enough to support sophisticated VR simulations and the available support of VR devices is still incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For faster and more effective VR simulation development we are currently exploring the use of the Unity Game Engine. We've recently begun the next step in this transition, which entails the integration of Unity with Tango.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Ludobox</title>
        <subtitle>Offline library dedicated to free-licensed games</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk &amp;amp; demo, Dcalk will open up the Ludobox, an Offline Games Library, to share its content as well as the R&amp;amp;D process of the past year and introduce next steps open to contributions !&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like book and music, board game has entered the era of reproducibility and distributed network. Here
and there, creators publish their 3D checkers on-line and editors release games in print-and-play, sometimes under a free licenses. If we can think, that these new formats will one day have their place in a toy library, how that turns the toy librarian profession, users'practices of these structures, and more broadly players ?
Promote game as a cultural object is Dcalk's mission. By exploring the creative process, publishing and
distribution of board games, we develop transfer spaces for ideas and values to open the sector to other
formats and considerations. The Digital Toy library embedds in itself tools, methodologies and values of the digital culture / free culture (license, copy, share, network).
Dcalk intends to prospect and accompany these new uses and practices at the crossroads of games and
commons, digital crafts and design, digital and cultural mediation, public libraries and fablabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk &amp;amp; demo, Dcalk will open up the Ludobox, an Offline Toy Library - following the PirateBox and LibraryBox successful initiatives allowing to share free digital content through an offline network – to gather and physically spreed free-licensed content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk &amp;amp; demo, Dcalk will open up the Ludobox, an Offline Games Library, to share its content:
• digital files ready-to-print containing rules and games'elements: role playing, pervasive game, card game to be cut, board to be made, etc.)
• files in .stl format(checkers, plates, tiles) for 3D printing
• game storage box pattern
 (cardboard or organic materials for laser cutter)
• pedagogical resources(tutorials and manuals on tools or free software, documentation / methodology to run game design workshops, etc.)
• publications on game design, free culture, DIY (essays, articles, e-books, etc)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Free Knowledge Game Jam: Bringing Two Worlds Together </title>
        <subtitle>How we ran a game jam for Free Knowledge and made everybody happy</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This year Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. partnered with the Computerspielemuseum Berlin and Cologne Game Lab to hold the first ever Free Knowledge Game Jam in Berlin in October 2015. A game jam is hackathon for games, where over the course of 24 hours, a game (or a prototype) should be developed. In our game jam we gave out a common theme: use one aspect of Free Knowledge in the game. The event was a great way to bring two worlds together - the world of Free Knowledge and Open Source software and the (often verycommercially-minded) game industry. This talk aims to introduce you to our concept of creating and promoting open source and free knowledge games via a game jam. Of course we will show you some of the creative games made during this event, too. Some games in-corporated open assets like graphics and sound. Some others used data or photos which are free to use via the Wikimedia APIs or repositories of Free Knowledge like Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at developers who are looking for a way to use open content for their games and for game jam organisers who will get an insight into what its like to push the creation of open source games in a fun way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked together with partners such as the Computerspielemuseum Berlin, Gamelab.berlin from the Humboldt University Berlin and Cologne Game Lab. Furthermore, we had media partners such as the well known indie game festival A.MAZE and the Berlin city senate project Projekt Zukunft which helped us make the event as great as it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Automating your Analysis with SAGA GIS</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) is an open source geographic information system (GIS) used for editing and analysing spatial data. It includes a large number of modules for the analysis of vector (point, line and polygon), table, grid and image data. Among others the package includes modules for geostatistics, image classification, projections, simulation of dynamic processes (hydrology, landscape development) and terrain analysis. The functionality can be accessed through a GUI, the command line or by using the C++ API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGA has been in development since 2001, and the centre of SAGA development is located in the Institute of Geography at the University of Hamburg, with contributions from the growing world wide community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will show some of the newer modules of SAGA and how these can be combined to scripts and toolchains to reproduce different steps of an analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Tempus - a framework for multimodal trip planning</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source engines for trip planning are growing in popularity. We are part of the movement by creating our own engine and a framework for the development of new algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tempus focuses on planning trips that involve all possible transport modalities, mixing private and public modes as well as shared vehicles, and on requests with multiple objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It relies on well-known open source components and standards like PostGIS, QGIS, WPS, boost graph and offers tools for importing routing data from various sources, including OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will illustrate the overall modular architecture of Tempus built around a C++ core and will detail recent additions to the engine, like the integration of Contraction Hierarchies, thanks to industial parternships.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mapbender3 is a client framework for spatial data infrastructures. It provides web based interfaces for displaying, navigating and interacting with OGC compliant services. Mapbender3 has a modern and user-friendly administration web interface to do all the work without writing a single line of code. Mapbender3 helps you to set up a repository for your OWS Services and to create indivdual application for different user needs. The software is is based on the PHP framework Symfony2 and integrates OpenLayers, MapQuery and JQuery. The Mapbender3 framework provides authentication and authorization services, OWS Proxy functionality, management interfaces for user, group and service administration. In the presentation we will have a look at some Mapbender3 solutions and find out how powerful Mapbender3 is! You will see how easy it is to publish your own application.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll be presenting the tools (geoclue, geocode-glib and GNOME Maps) we have been slowing creating to make GNOME fully geo-aware and and how these tools harness existing open source and open data projects out there. While our focus has been GNOME, most of these tools are very much generic and could (and IMO should) be used by other Linux-based system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Take walking paths from OpenStreetMap, take public transport open data in GTFS format, deploy OpenTripPlanner, expose open APIs, customise any of the client applications. This is how next-generation journey planners are being built: open standards, open data, open APIs, open source code. Authorities in places such as Portland, New York State, Netherlands, Finland, Iceland and Oslo are already working this way in collaboration with citizens and businesses. Latest result of this model to replace proprietary solutions is Digitransit, a mobile-first HTML5 passenger information app by the main transport authorities in Finland (Helsinki Regional Transport Authority HSL and Finnish Transport Agency FTA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example how more civic tech should be built, which leads to more open source from the government. Transport has proven an easy and interesting field for citizen participation, as everyone has an itch to scratch, and it's visual with maps and realtime data. If the transport data is open in your city, you can set this up. If your city hasn't opened data yet, here's one reason why they should.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap project has a lot of editing applications for every system. Experienced mappers edit in JOSM and Vespucci, amateurs use iD and Go Map, novices... A sad thing is, there are no simple editors, because OSM data model is not simple. And on mobile devices, the situation worsens, because the quality of a user interface becomes crucial. In this talk, Ilya Zverev would present the state of OSM editing on mobile devices, and how MAPS.ME set off to build a perfect and open map editor for non-mappers, attracting thousands to improve OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ol3-Cesium is a javascript library for adding a 3D globe to OpenLayers3
applications. No need for plugins, it runs natively with WEBGL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started is very simple and you can see your data (raster, vectors)
on the Cesium globe and navigate in 3D. Synchronization is automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will show how easy it is to get started and what happens under the hood
in the library. The talk will be illustrated with demos and ideas for the
future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>iTowns, an opensource web framework for 3D visualization</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This session presents a new web framework called iTowns, which is a JS/WebGL visualization framework aimed at visualizing various kind of 3D data : buildings, meshes, point clouds, projected textures and more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;iTowns is a new framework for 3D data visualization based on latest web technologies, namely WebGL. It aims at providing a full-featured library for immersive environment visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French IGN research laboratories (MATIS, LOEMI, COGIT) have been working for years on capturing, processing and visualizing 3D geospatial data. iTowns is a product initially developped in this frame thanks to French ANR and FUI fundings with CAP DIGITAL. IGN decided to release iTowns as OpenSource in the end of 2015, so as to broaden the use of this 3D geospatial library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iTowns platform provides 3D visualization with immersive views and various kind of data. Point Clouds coming from LIDAR sensors can be displayed very efficently, so as structured 3D models or complex meshes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on THREE.JS, iTowns provides a ground to build 3D geospatial applications for various purposes. It extends THREE.JS to provide geospatial features and access to new types of data relating to GIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first use case is to make advantage of the 3D mobile sensor vehicle from IGN, named STEREOPOLIS, which provides a large range of data. Virtual visits of complex indoor buildings can be another example of use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation provides an overview of the iTowns product with a demonstration, and showcases a minimal example of use. We then discuss the roadmap and evolution towards the next version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What is an SRID, and why should I care? Does MySQL care? The answers to these questions and more will be given in this talk as we give a quick introduction to GIS in general and in MySQL in particular. MySQL 5.7 gave GIS a real boost, and more is to be expected in the future. If you're not using it yet, it's time to get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This crash course covers data types, import, export, indexing, operations on GIS data, caveats and how to prepare for the future of more and better GIS in MySQL. If you've never used GIS before and are curious to learn, or if you already know GIS and want to know how MySQL supports it, this talk is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Managing Spatio-Temporal Big Data through Scalable OGC Web Services</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In geosciences, and especially in the fields of remote sensing and geomatics, frequently large amounts of raster data need to be stored and processed efficiently. Rasdaman is tackling the big data deluge by providing a scalable array database that is capable of storing complex geographic data structures and exposing them through open and standard web services. Actually, the rasdaman team is actively shaping the OGC Big Geo Data standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rasdaman is the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) Core Reference Implementation, but also supports WMS and WPS, for example. A particularly exciting extension of the WCS service is the Processing Extension. This links in the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) which allows users to exploit the flexibility of a fully fledged query language for coverages to request ad-hoc parallel processing directly on the server, minimizing data transfer and response times.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

This links in the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) which allows users to exploit the flexibility of a fully fledged query language for coverages to request ad-hoc parallel processing directly on the server, minimizing data transfer and response times. With that in mind, our proposed workshop will follow this structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting the core concepts and technology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rasdaman array model and its query language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GMLCOV model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Web Coverage Service and its extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-on exercises, experimenting with real data using the above mentioned services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy rasdaman and its required components to create a local service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to ingest data into rasdaman and how to expose it as a coverage. Three types of coverages will be handled (2D rectified imag, 3D regular time series of satellite imagery,3D irregular time series of satellite imagery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to use the WCS service to access coverages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore the extensions of the WCS service and the functionality that they provide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-hoc process the coverages using WCPS queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

MongoDB is a database that has incorporated geospatial capabilities from its early versions and has not stopped improving such functionality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will approach the following topics:
- how to efficiently store this types of data streams
- how to optimize spatial queries on your data set
- understand the implementation details and challenges around geospatial for databases like MongoDB
- fast tutorial of all available operators on this space
- Integration between MongoDB and geoserver&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trajectory: A novel geospatial data model of Pivotal GPDB</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the drastically increasing size of trajectory data generated by location-based services and applications which are collected from inexpensive GPS-enabled devices, the availability of such massive trajectory data has received significant attentions in recent years and spawned various novel applications, such as social gaming, route planning, carpooling, tour recommendation, commuting pattern etc. We are developing this novel geospatial data model in Pivotal Greenplum database, which considers a sequential data type that records the spatial locations of moving objects over time. In this talk, we will survey existing prototypes on trajectory and introduce our design and progress inner Pivotal GPDB, the world's first open source MPP data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Description:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuous proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile devices (e.g., car navigation systems, smart phones and PDAs) and online map services (e.g., Google-maps, Bing- maps and MapQuest) enable people to log their current geographic locations and share their movements to web sites such as Bikely, GPS-Way-points, Share-My-Routes, Microsoft GeoLife. In the meantime, more and more social network sites, including Twitter, Foursquare and Facebook, begin to support the applications of sharing GPS traces.  According to GSA’s reports, almost half of Apple and Android apps are collecting user location information. As a result, more and more smartphone users are appreciating or relying on the capabilities of LBS in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, geospatial exports and scientists mostly organize this kind of geographic data in term of &lt;strong&gt;trajectory&lt;/strong&gt;, which is composed of a sequence of time-stamped geographic points. Then they study the movements of a moving object and the behaviors of a cluster of moving objects, for example, the touring habits of visitors in a museum. The availability of such massive trajectory data creates various novel applications, such as social gaming, route planning, carpooling, tour recommendation, commuting pattern etc. Take trajectory search and recommendation, for example, which is designed to retrieve from a database the raw trajectories that best connect (or are close to) a few selected locations (e.g., a set of user specified geographical locations on map). Cyclopath is a vivid example, which tends to find bike routes that match the personalized cycling demand and share personal cycling knowledge with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major feature of trajectory that distinguishes from other geo-spatial data types, such as geometry and raster of PostGIS, is that: trajectory is a kind of time-sequenced geo-spatial data. An essential idea behind trajectory is that discrete GPS samplings are meaningless and difficult to be retrieved, and with this data model we can creatively bridge the gap between raw geospatial samplings storage and upper geospatial analytics requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several trajectory prototypes have been proposed in recent years, such as Domino from UIC America, Secondo from FernUni Gemany, Hermos from UP Greece, ST-Toolkit from EPFL Switzerland, and SharkDB from UQ Australia etc. Almost all of them are developed for academic research and education, and hard to be integrated into general-purpose databases. To the best of my knowledge, we are the first to develop this novel geospatial data model in commercial database, that is, inner Pivotal Greenplum Database (GPDB), the world's first open source MPP data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will briefly introduce (1) the state-of-art of trajectory research and academic prototypes in the world, (2) the design concept of trajectory data model that provides high-performance parallelization of data loading and data processing, (3) the latest status and process of trajectory development built inner Pivotal GPDB.  Besides, I will provide examples of how data science teams may transform billions of customer records to tackle the real-world problem in efficient way. I will also discuss our plan of making trajectory open-source in the GPDB community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Geocoding is the bridge that links location strings to points on a map. This talk will discuss the state of opensource and commercial geocoders, then provide a solution based on the openaddresses.io data repo running on a free micro instance on the Amazon Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Geocoding, as an information retrieval process, is divided into Forward Geocoding (a location described in words into a latitude,longitude point)  and Reverse Geocoding (a point into a location description).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the advent of the online map, this problem has attracted considerable attention. The main players today are commercial vendors such as Google Maps. Open source alternatives have usually fallen short (for eg, Openstreetmap's Nominatim). In fact all geocoders (commercial and free) fall short in various ways as I will demonstrate in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also demonstrate how you can build your own geocoder if the data is available. I've built my own over the last 11 years (written in ModPerl) and you can too (in your language of choice) using openaddresses.io, the free and open global address collection, which currently provides over 200 Million addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution runs on minimal resources (just 1G or Ram and 1 vCpu on a free micro instance) and may be a bit slow, if you need performance get a faster server. I'll also show how to extract and standardize addresses from bodies of text very quickly, regardless of the amount of text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will describe the Apertium project (http://www.apertium.org). Apertium develops a free/open-source platform for machine translation and language technology. Apertium also develops data for many languages, with a focus on lesser-resourced and marginalised languages, but also develops data for larger languages. The platform, including data for tens of language pairs, a translation engine and auxiliary tools is being developed around the world, both in universities and companies and by a growing numbers independent free-software developers. There are currently 40 published language pairs within the project (including a number of "firsts" — for example Spanish—Occitan, Breton—French, Basque—Spanish, North Sámi–Norwegian Bokmål and Kazakh–Tatar among others), and many more in development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will be given by Dr. Francis M. Tyers. Dr. Tyers has been involved in the field of free/open-source machine translation for nine years; he completed his PhD at the Universitat d'Alacant, and now works as a postdoctoral researcher at UiT Norgga árktalaš universitehta. He has published over 30 articles related to machine translation, and has been involved in the teaching of several courses on machine translation. He is secretary of the ISCA SIG SaLTMiL (Speech and Language Technology for Minority Languages), the ACL SIG SIGUR (Uralic Computational Linguistics) and the Apertium project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Translating actively developed project can be sometimes challenging, but there are ways to improve the workflow. With &lt;a href="http://weblate.org"&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt; you can boost your translators community by giving them instant access to edit current strings and pushing them directly to your VCS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tired of manual merging of translations, pulling them from third party services or receiving them by email? With Weblate the translations are instantly available in the VCS repository and translators automatically follow your development. Weblate can help you with other parts of the translation process as well - keeping in sync translations of multiple branches or doing quality checks on the translations. On top of that it retains proper attribution for translations as they are the authors of VCS commits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Localizers are some of the most active contributors to FOSS.  They often work tirelessly across multiple projects making sure your project reaches new audiences.  By understanding some of the consequences of developer decisions as they impact localizers you can become a developer that makes the lives and contribution of localizers really easy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Localizers in FOSS are often no different from localizers in the commercial world.  They take what they are given. In the commercial world because they're paid money, in the FOSS world because the end goal, a localized product, is really important to localizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they deal with some painful process, painful decisions and a lack of awareness of the impact that development work can have on the localizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this talk is to raise some of the issues in file formats, localisable strings, language choice and process that can make localization frustrating.  Developers who attend should be able to walk away with a much better understanding of how what they do ripples into the lives of localizers. They should be better equipped to help improve the lives of their localizers and be better informed of the impact that their decisions will have on the localization team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End result, happy localizers and happy developers, creating a great multilingual product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Developing XLIFF-based FOSS localization tools for increased inter-operability, better collaboration, and data freedom</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;XLIFF represents a new generation of localisation storage, providing a basic standard for expressing the common features of other formats, while allowing for extensibility to encompass more diverse features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be looking at the history of XLIFF and how we’re implementing it with FOSS localisation tools like Pootle and the Translate Toolkit, and what this will mean for localizers, developers and software managers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The localization world is no stranger to the document interchange problems of word processors.  The XLIFF format emerged to assist localizers in sharing and moving localization files between tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at some of the history of XLIFF, the false starts and the issues of some of the initial versions.  Then look at the current 2.0 version of XLIFF and the advantages that have come about by simplifying the format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Translate Toolkit is used as a file converter into PO and we’ll look at our efforts to migrate the toolkit to use XLIFF as its target format.  XLIFF, being a richer format, allows us to express more of the data that we get from other files formats and that we struggle to squeeze into PO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this we are developing a FOSS library for XLIFF 2.0.  and implementing extensions to the formats we need to support. In doing so, we aim to build on XLIFF’s powerful extensibility to provide lossless storage of localisation data, and minimally lossy conversion between formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have stabilized this library, we will be refactoring the data model within Pootle, our web-based translation tool, to make better use of these new features for conversion and data interchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have identified a number of common localisation patterns that are not specified within the core XLIFF schema, so we will be working with the relevant standards body to have these use cases specified as standard extensions to the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2014 Oxford University Press (OUP) launched the &lt;a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ogl"&gt;Oxford Global Languages (OGL)&lt;/a&gt; initiative whose focus is to develop linguistic resources particularly for digitally under-represented languages. The aim of the programme is to help language communities over the world to create, maintain, and use digital language resources while developing digital-ready content formats to support the growing language needs of technology worldwide. OGL aims to create a win-win situation whereby communities of digitally under-represented languages are able to contribute content through an online platform, licensees are able to consume that data in the digital format they need for a cost, and OUP generates enough revenue to sustain free community access to the online platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2015 OUP launched the first two OGL websites for &lt;a href="https://zu.oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;isiZulu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nso.oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;Northern Sotho&lt;/a&gt;. The backend of these websites draws on an API (Application Programming Interface) which interacts with the RDF master data in a triple store and delivers it to the frontend serialized as JSON-LD. The websites enable language communities worldwide to add, review, and share language-related content for digitally under-represented languages. Three months after the launch of the isiZulu and Northern Sotho websites crowdsourcing contributed to create and improve 537 entries on the online dictionaries and the number of community contributors is increasing day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation focuses on the API (Application Programming Interface) developed to power these websites. We show API calls to search and retrieve dictionary entries, add new content on the website in real-time and delete it if need be. We discuss the advantages of API-powered dictionaries, how the API allows OUP to crowdsource linguistic data from online language communities, and how APIs facilitate the integration of data with external systems and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to make an appeal to language enthusiasts, linguists, and software developers to contribute to the OGL initiative and experiment with our APIs. In the coming months OUP is planning to release API-powered dictionary websites for Malay and Urdu, and we are building online communities around these languages. On the technology side we are currently giving early access to our APIs and SPARQL endpoint to software developers in order to gather requirements for publicly accessible APIs for given languages and for publishing some of our RDF as Linked Data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>IXA pipes: Easy and ready use NLP tools for language communities</title>
        <subtitle>Free NLP tools for several languages, including Basque, Galician, Spanish</subtitle>
        <track>Coding for Language Communities</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;IXA pipes (http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes/) is a modular set of Natural Language Processing tools (or pipes) which provide easy access to NLP technology for several languages. It offers robust and efficient linguistic annotation to both researchers and non-NLP experts with the aim of lowering the barriers of using NLP technology either for research purposes or for small industrial developers and SMEs. The ixa pipes can be used or exploit its modularity to pick and change different components.  Every ixa pipe can be up an running after two simple steps. The tools require Java 1.7+ to run and are designed to come with all batteries included, which means that it is not required to do any system configuration or install any third-party dependencies. The modules will run on any platform as long as a JVM 1.7+ is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IXA pipes are just a set of processes chained by their standard streams, in a way that the output of each process feeds directly as input to the next one. The Unix pipes metaphor has been applied for NLP tools by adopting a very simple and well known data centric architecture, in which every module/pipe is interchangeable by any other tool as long as it reads and writes the required data format via the standard streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data format in which both the input and output of the modules needs to be formatted to represent and pipe linguistic annotations is NAF. We currently covered tokenization, pos tagging, lemmatization, Named Entity Recognition and classification and probabilistic parsing, but further annotations and languages can be easily added. The tools are distributed under Apache License 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to keep the theoretical part as short as possible and do some practical work with the modules. In order to save time, it will be nice (although not compulsory) if attendants would come with a laptop with the following components installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Development Kit 1.7+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache Maven 3.+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datasets/Corpora such as:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CoNLL 2002 NER data http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The idea is to download, compile, tag texts and train your own models in a very short time using IXA pipes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free and open source software deals with many kinds of data, including written text. Authors of all levels are prone to making spelling or grammatical mistakes when editing content. The challenge is to offer feedback directly to a writer, during the content creation process, in order to fix errors immediately. Simultaneously, his or her writing skills improve accordingly. Several FOSS writing tools are currently available with a myriad of language bindings, libraries and APIs. This talk will introduce software developers to best practises, help avoiding pitfalls, give a glance of the future and put a smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Free and open source software deals with many kinds of data, including written text. Authors of all levels are prone to making spelling or grammatical mistakes when editing content. This can result in ugly, ambiguous and incomprehensible texts or, in worst-case scenarios, even errors with severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All sorts of integrated development environments warn software developers on mistakes and probable risky patterns by means of lint-like source code checking. Likewise, software can be used as well to assist developers and end-users in writing boring documents, prose and poetry. The challenge is to offer feedback directly to a writer during the content creation process in order to fix errors immediately. Simultaneously, his or her writing skills improve accordingly. Writing tools can do much more, such as suggesting synonyms, handling hyphenation and helping with style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several FOSS writing tools are currently available with a myriad of language bindings, libraries and APIs. One was even presented in the opening keynote of FOSDEM 2015. Some applications are deprecated, others are used inefficiently, sometimes configuration is faulty and suggestions can be handled incorrectly. Furthermore, not all languages are supported equally and contributions such as lexica, corpora et cetera are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By means of slides containing practical examples you will learn how to integrate FOSS writing tools in an efficient way to improve textual content creation. A special but very quick sidestep will be made regarding proper names for use in geographical data. This talk will introduce software developers to best practises, help avoiding pitfalls, give a glance of the future and put a smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Basic actions to enhance digital vitality </subtitle>
        <track>Coding for Language Communities</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will introduce the Digital Language Diversity Project, a three-year project funded under EC Erasmus+ programme that started in September 2015. The project addresses the problem of the scarce use and usability of EU regional and minority languages in digital media and over digital devices, with the aim of providing basic know-how to help anyone who is willing to become the restorer of these fading languages on the web. The main outcome of the project will be a training programme for adult speakers of regional and minority languages to empower them with the know-how for creating and sharing digital content.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Somewhere a language dies every two weeks. One tile of the complex mosaic resulting from human evolution - the ability to communicate ideas and opinions with language - is lost forever.
You may think this is happening in remote islands you have never heard about, because of the death of the last speaker. In reality, this is starting to happen just around your corner, with minority languages often neglected by local institutions, with speakers not aware of their bilingualism, with activists lacking tools to preserve their languages.
In this respect, digital media represent a challenge and an opportunity for minority languages. They are a challenge, because regional and minority languages are severely underrepresented on digital media, and almost completely excluded from digital services which are usually available in EU national languages only. This situation is expected to worsen in the near future, because current technological development is primarily focused on English and on a handful of other major languages, neglecting EU languages with less economic power.
But digital media represent an opportunity as well, since they can provide minority languages the strategic opportunity to have the same “digital dignity”, “digital identity” and “digital longevity” as large, well-developed languages on the Web, and thus contribute to their usability in an everyday context that is of foremost importance.
The Digital Language Diversity Project, a three-year project funded under EC Erasmus+ programme that started in September 2015, addresses the problem of the scarce use and usability of EU regional and minority languages in digital media and over digital devices.
The aim of the project is to provide basic know-how to help anyone who is willing to become the restorer of these fading languages on the web. The main outcome of the project will be a training programme for adult speakers of regional and minority languages to empower them with the know-how for creating and sharing digital content.
Trainees will learn about some basic actions that could improve the digital vitality of their minority language or could help others in this praiseworthy task. Both as a coder and as a speaker, they will learn how they can contribute to make Europe the stage where all languages are represented digitally.
As coders, they can help building basic language resources such as annotated datasets, lexical resources, crawled corpora etc. using freely available toolkits and crowdsourcing methodologies. As speakers, they will learn about all the opportunities to improve and augment the presence of their (minority) language on the web, helping with the translation of Wikipedia pages, writing subtitles for TED talks or just recording pronunciation of words for the Forvo community.
Other outcomes will be:
- a survey detailing the digital fitness of four regional/minority languages spoken in Europe: Basque in Spain, Breton in France, Karelian in Finland, and Sardinian in Italy;
- “Digital Language Survival Kits”, i.e. recommendations about what needs and can be done for a language “to go digital”: which are the challenges and difficulties, which areas need to be addressed first, which tools are available. The recommendations will comprise a tool for self-assessing the digital fitness of languages other than those comprised in the case study.
- A roadmap, aimed at stakeholders and policy makers, detailing the institutional and technological challenges as well as the proposed solutions for paving the way to a more widespread use of all European languages over digital devices&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest barriers for accessing knowledge on the Internet is language. We tend to provide information in one or at most a few languages, which makes it hard for speakers of all the other languages to access that same information.
This is also an issue on Wikipedia, a project widely and internationally used by all kind of people. But there are many topics that are only covered in few languages on Wikipedia. People who don’t speak any of these don’t have access to all the information available potentially vital to them.
This is a huge issue we need to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have Wikidata, Wikimedia’s knowledge base, which collects localized open structured data in one central place and makes it available to everyone.
In this talk I will show you how we can give more people more access to more knowledge by making use of Wikipedia’s reach and Wikidata’s multilingual data.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Signal Intelligence Challenges are a great and fun way to get students interested in communications and SDR. We want to report from our previous experience gained from organizing the IEEE Signal Intelligence Challenge in 2014 and 2015. This includes our educational goals as well as practical concerns when organizing such an event, ranging from frequency regulations to giving students access to SDRs and the required software tools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to present a framework for building software-defined radios that are able to self-optimize their parameters using evolutionary algorithms. As part of a student research project, such a system has been implemented on the basis of the DEAP library for Python. The talk will discuss the goal of this framework, describe the overall system architecture, and present a system prototype that has been employed to optimize radio transmission parameters in an unknown radio environment in order to maximize the achievable throughput. The current prototype targets Iris-based SDRs. However, as the entire software is Python-based  and employs standard components for interfacing the SDR, it can easily be ported to GNU Radio or other SDR frameworks. We will also present some preliminary results that have been obtained through over-the-air experiments in which we optimized different power parameters (HW and SW gain stages) and modulation and coding scheme in an unknown radio environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The rad1o was the badge of the Chaos Communication Camp 2015. It features a full fledged SDR, which is compatible with and based on the HackRF. The talk will cover different aspects of it coming to live and how to utilize it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the rad1o is to provide an SDR to interested people and groups, sparking more interest into the topic. Do do this, an SDR was designed into a conference badge (namely for the Chaos Communication Camp 2015). It is complete with a rechargeable battery, a display and some I/O capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the talk we will talk about the steps needed to get such a project actually happening (which would not have been possible without open source). We will also quickly cover some of the different ways to use the badge for SDR applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SDR projects have come a long way, and allow users to do all sorts of things, ranging from telecoms services (e.g. setting up a base station) to all kinds of scientific purposes (radio astronomy, DSP, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this panel, we want to bring together leaders from various projects as well as community members, and discuss the future of free SDR, and identify possible areas of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As SDR communities, we will discuss these topics (among others):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the near- and long-term goals for free SDR projects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we collaborate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have we missed areas where we could use more action (between GNU Radio
and the others we have the scientific stuff and the telecoms stuff
sorted out, but what else is there)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which communities do we want to engage with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We invite project leaders, but also all community members to join us for this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RFNoC is a framework to simplify FPGA development for DSP processing. It is fully open source and integrates well into GNU Radio. In this talk, RFNoC is presented and demoed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RFNoC (RF Network on Chip) is a powerful framework to simply FPGA development for DSP processing. RFNoC applications are mostly heterogeneous signal processing applications, where workload is shared between the FPGA and GPP, and tasks are assigned to whichever hardware is more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFNoC integrates well into GNU Radio, the most popular free software DSP framework. It is fully open source and currently works with the X310 and E310 USRPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract></abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent research projects consider Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) as a key enabler for the future flexible 5G air interface, mostly due to its increased spectral efficiency compared to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Moreover, it is of high interest to have a rapid prototyping framework for performance validation and proof-of-concept of the novel diverse communication techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the  design steps and implementation issues of an FBMC transceiver within the existing Gnu Radio-based framework.
The high reconfigurability of the framework further allows for the future easy integration and evaluation of other 5G PHY layer candidates. Several transmission scenarios are considered comparing the spectral properties between the FBMC and OFDM systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present the problem of synchronizing a system of distributed receivers by the means of GPS in order to use it to localize radio wave emissions. Due to the speed of light the synchronization has be accurate down to the nanoseconds. In a low cost system without the availability of atomic clocks at each anchor node, this is quite a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Wideband measurement strategies: from RADAR to passive wireless sensors</title>
        <subtitle>... and how passive wireless sensors were/are used by intelligence agencies.</subtitle>
        <track>Software Defined Radio</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RADAR systems are instrinsically wideband devices, with a range resolution inversely proportional to the probe signal bandwidth. Recording wideband signals is a challenging task, with high data rates often yielding low resolution samples and hence poor range. Multiple strategies have been investigated to reduce the recording rate, including stroboscopy (assuming a static environment), downconversion or frequency stepped measurements, all of which are well suited to feed Software Defined Radio applications. In addition to monitoring passive reflectors, cooperative targets can be designed to reflect a signal whose delay is not representative of distance or velocity but a physical quantity. One early application of such an insight has been the bug placed by Russians in the American ambassador house, modulating an incoming continuous wave illumination signal to an amplitude modulated backscattered signal. Although the leaked NSA documents hint at such techniques still being used today, we will be interested in more daily applications in which sensors are designed to return a signal representative of an identifier (ID-tag) or a physical property.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While Software Defined Radio (SDR) is mostly concerned with data transmission, especially for communication purposes, one original aspect of RADAR application of SDR is to consider the complete system, from emitter to receiver, and including the design of dedicated cooperative targets acting as sensors. While the backscattered signal from the target includes a signature representative of a physical quantity (amplitude, frequency, time of flight), the SDR approach provides the flexibility needed to adapt the emitted signal to the target signature. As an example, when the signature from a narrowband resonator is the resonance frequency -- shifting for example with temperature -- the flexibility of SDR allows for focusing on the spectral features under interest and prevents wasting time on regions of the spectrum where the signature is known, from prior measurement, not to lie. While the original Theremin [1] spying experiment [2] was using a dielectric cavity resonator whose boundary conditions were varying with a thin membrane position -- vibrating under varying pressure waves from the ambassador voice -- to convert the incoming Continuous Wave (CW) to a backscattered Amplitude Modulated (AM) signal, the signal to noise ratio is plagued by clutter from environmental reflectors. Time gating, as trivially implemented in SDR by a delay between switching between emission and reception for clutter to fade out before the sensor signal is detected, offers the opportunity for improved detection range which is hardly accessible to purely hardware implementation (eg Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave -- FMCW) RADAR strategies. The main challenge of SDR implementation of RADAR techniques is the necessary wideband emitter or receiver: various techniques have been envisioned to overcome the narrowband limitation of high resolution Analog/Digital sampling, including Frequency Stepped Continuous Wave or stroboscopy. These various approaches will be discussed, with hopefully some low cost demonstration of remote sensing using commonly available hardware, including acoustic filters acting as delay lines [3].&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache Flink is an open source platform for distributed stream and batch data processing. In this talk we will show how Flink's streaming engine and support for native iterations make it an excellent candidate for the development of large scale machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on FlinkML, a new effort to bring scalable machine learning tools to the Flink community. We will provide an introduction to the library, illustrate how we employ some state-of-the-art algorithms to make FlinkML truly scalable, and provide a view into the challenges and decisions one has to make when designing a robust and scalable machine learning library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if time permits, we will demonstrate how one can perform some interactive analysis using FlinkML and the notebook environment of Apache Zeppelin.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>MADlib: Distributed In-Database Machine Learning for Fun and Profit</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache MADlib (incubating) is an innovative SQL-based open source library for scalable in-database analytics.  It provides parallel implementations of mathematical, statistical and machine learning methods for structured and unstructured data.  MADlib also has an R interface for data scientists who prefer to work in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will describe the impetus behind creating a SQL-based scale-out machine learning project, review the architecture and implementation, and describe some of the recent functionality added by the Apache community.  We will also present the R interface to MADlib, called PivotalR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will discuss the future direction of the project and invite big data developers and data scientists to participate in Apache MADlib, for both fun and profit.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the MADlib project is to accelerate innovation in the data science community via a shared library of scalable in-database analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many existing analytics products do not scale in a way that makes it convenient and economical to operate on very large data sets, which is a more and more common scenario in this era of Big Data. The methods in MADlib have been designed to take advantage of the shared-nothing, scale-out parallelism offered by modern parallel database engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently MADlib runs on the following open source platforms:  Apache HAWQ (incubating) Hadoop-native SQL Database, Greenplum database, and PostgreSQL.  Big Data has also brought about a renewed interest in query optimization, so as these platforms innovate in the area of distributed query performance, libraries such as MADlib can benefit greatly and provide even more significant benefits to research and commercial organizations that want to reason over very large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other key principles driving the architecture of MADlib are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operate on the data locally in-database. Do not move data between multiple runtime environments unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilize best of breed parallel database engines, but separate the machine learning logic from database specific implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster open community development, including active ties to academic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We look forward to presenting this topic at FOSDEM’16!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talks will present how to perform benchmarking of Big Data systems, from low-powered devices, HPC clusters, to cloud IaaS and PaaS.  It will guide participants on how to define clusters, select benchmark suites and configuration with the ALOJA open source tools.  ALOJA (http://aloja.bsc.es)  is a research initiative from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to explore new cost-effective hardware architectures for Big Data.  During its first year, ALOJA's benchmarking efforts have produced the largest public repository with over 50,000 Hadoop benchmark runs.  The searchable repository features different applications for Hadoop, software configurations, data sizes, and more than 100 different hardware deployment options.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Cluster definition and automated deployment on local (vagrant clusters), on-prem and cloud environments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Automating and orchestrating OS, Hadoop, JVM configuration across clusters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Benchmark selection and iteration of configurations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Metrics collections, results gathering, and importing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Advanced data views for aggregate results with filters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Analyzing performance results and selecting configurations&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;hanythingondemand (or HOD for short) is a set of scripts to start services, for example a Hadoop cluster, from within another resource management system (e.g., Torque/PBS) on an HPC system. As such, it allows traditional users of HPC systems to experiment with Hadoop and other services, or use it as a production setup if there is no dedicated setup available. Next to Hadoop clusters, HOD can also create HBase databases, IPython notebooks, and set up a Spark environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motivate the need for a framework like HOD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discuss its history (based on 'Hadoop On Demand’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explain how it works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;showcase several use cases, including:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; easily creating one or more Hadoop clusters on-the-fly for interactive use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; running batch scripts on a Hadoop cluster (non-interactively)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; spawning an IPython notebook with desired resources and connecting to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Timely dataflow in Rust</title>
        <subtitle>HPC performance with a dataflow programming model</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I'll present recent work on an implementation of "timely dataflow", a neat new data-parallel programming model, in Rust, a neat new-ish programming language from Mozilla. I'll talk through how Rust's take on ownership is a great fit for distributed big data programming, and in particular how it lets us write rich high-level dataflow programs that still have the performance characteristics we expect from hand-written code.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; is a new programming language which provides high-level programming idioms that compile down to code that is intended to be as good as (or better than) one could do by hand. At the core of Rust is the concept of "ownership", where all values, resources, allocations, handles, etc have a unique "owner", with a statically known lifetime. This allows Rust to provide automatic memory management, providing safe code with relatively few (not zero) leaks, without requiring a tracing garbage collector. In exchange, there is some amount of additional cognitive overhead when resources have weird or unknown lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timely dataflow is a model for data-parallel dataflow computations, introduced as the foundation for the high-throughput, low-latency distributed &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/naiad/"&gt;Naiad&lt;/a&gt; system. Naiad achieved top-tier performance by providing programmers with a well-engineered data plane and simple but effective control mechanisms, but otherwise staying out of the way. At the same time, much of Naiad's engineering work went in to fighting against the language and runtime in order to extract the intended performance, similar to what several JVM based systems are currently struggling against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having recently been given the opportunity, I re-implemented timely dataflow in Rust and found it to be a very liberating experience. Rust's concept of ownership dovetails very elegantly with the data-driven computation of most distributed dataflow systems. At the same time, by providing Rust clear information about data ownership the compiled code avoids the overheads (and pain) associated with a garbage collected runtime. The look and feel of user code is mostly the same as in managed languages; ownership issues are rarely raised to the data-driven, and so ownership-friendly, user code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What result is a system that presents a high-level dataflow programming interface, but whose performance resembles that of carefully implemented HPC codes. I'll try and explain a few key moments that make this possible, and how systems implemented over other platforms should at least understand and explain what they are giving up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>ClusterShell</title>
        <subtitle>Scalable command execution library and tools</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;HPC administration tasks require admins to run identical commands across their clusters efficiently and frequently.
Cluster tools develop again and again their own set of commands to perform similar tasks. Admins often develop their own scripts trying to implement fast execution, not always successfully.
ClusterShell proposes to address these problems by offering a new set of command-line tools and a Python framework, both relying on the same optimized code and features. It took the best of famous commands, like pdsh, and improved it. The library can be used to ease admin script development and remove the burden of implementing optimized parallelism.
ClusterShell supports multiple execution backends like SSH or RSH variants. Tools from other projects already rely on ClusterShell for their efficient command execution like MilkCheck or Shine. Moreover, ClusterShell offers a powerful way to manage range of nodes which could be used in any tools using its Python API.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation is intended to any cluster or server farm administrator, with minimal administration experience, but also Python tool developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurelien is HPC system admin and developer on large-scale supercomputers from CEA for 10 years. Highly involved in parallel filesystems and cluster management. He is involved in ClusterShell design and code since its inception in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source communities are filled with huge amounts of data just waiting to be analyzed. Getting this data into a format that can be easily used for analysis may seem intimidating at first, but there are some very useful open source tools that make this task relatively easy. The primary tools used in this talk are the open source Metrics Grimoire tools that take data from various community sources and store it in a database where it can be easily queried and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover: CVSAnalY to gather and analyze source code repository data; MLStats to gather and analyze mailing list data; other Metrics Grimoire tools for bug trackers, IRC, Wikis and more; and Gource to visualize source code repository data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience for this talk is anyone who is interested in learning new ways to extract data from open source communities. This talk will be interesting for people participating in communities, data geeks, researchers and others who are interested in learning more about communities. The audience should have basic data science knowledge, including running database queries and basic data manipulation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Reproducible and User-Controlled Package Management in HPC with GNU Guix</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Support teams of high-performance computing (HPC) systems often find themselves between a rock and a hard place: on one hand, they understandably administrate these large systems in a conservative way, but on the other hand, they try to satisfy their users by deploying up-to-date tool chains as well as libraries and scientific software. HPC system users often have no guarantee that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on the same system—software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same software environment elsewhere. We present GNU Guix and the functional package management paradigm and show how it can improve reproducibility and sharing among researchers with representative use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Functional package management is a discipline that transcribes the functional programming paradigm to software deployment: build and installation processes are viewed as pure functions in the mathematical sense—whose result depends exclusively on the inputs—, and their result is a value—that is, an immutable directory. Since build and installation processes are pure functions, their results can effectively be “cached” on disk. Likewise, two independent runs of a given build process for a given set of inputs should return the same value—i.e., bit-identical files. This approach was first described and implemented in the Nix package manager. Guix reuses low-level mechanisms from Nix to implement the same paradigm, but offers a unified interface for package definitions and their implementations, all embedded in a single programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Scylla is a new NoSQL database, capable of 2 million requests per second per node, while providing Apache Cassandra compatibility and scaling properties. Scylla applies systems programming techniques to a horizontally scalable NoSQL design to achieve extreme performance improvements. As CPU core counts continue to grow, along with the raw speed of networking and storage devices available on a modern system, software design approaches that were valid and safe even a few years ago are no longer sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scylla enables high throughput, low latency, and rapid completion of housekeeping operations such as compaction. Scylla eliminates known performance bottlenecks of existing NoSQL servers by running multiple engines, one per core, each with its own memory, CPU and multi-queue NIC.  Scylla bypasses key performance bottlenecks that can affect NoSQL server performance using per-core memory allocation to avoid locking, and asynchronous I/O for storage to bypass the system page cache.  With Scylla, NoSQL projects can avoid performance uncertainties up front in order to deploy a system that performs and scales with a low risk of unpredictable performance issues later.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Today, many supercomputing sites spend considerable effort aggregating a large
suite of open-source projects on top of their chosen base Linux distribution in
order to provide a capable HPC environment for their users. They also
frequently leverage a mix of external and in-house tools to perform software
builds, provisioning, config management, software upgrades, and system
diagnostics. Although the functionality is similar, the implementations across
sites is often different which can lead to duplication of effort. This
presentation will use the above challenges as motivation for introducing a new,
open-source HPC community (OpenHPC) that is focused on providing HPC-centric
package builds for a variety of common building-blocks in an effort to minimize
duplication, implement integration testing to gain validation confidence, and
provide a platform to share configuration recipes from a variety of sites.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>XALT: Tracking User Jobs and Environments on a Supercomputer</title>

        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let's talk real, no-kiddin' supercomputer analytics, aimed at moving
beyond monitoring the machine as a whole or even its individual
hardware components. We're interested in drilling down to the level of
individual tasks, users, and binaries. We’re after ready
answers to the "what, where, how, when and why" that stakeholders are
clamoring for: everything from which libraries (or individual
functions!) are in demand, to preventing the problems that get in the
way of successful science. This talk will show how XALT can provide
this type of job-level insight.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;XALT can provide a wide range of metrics and measures of
job-level activity. There are benefits to both users and stakeholders:
sponsoring institutions interested in strategic priorities;
organizations concerned about meeting users' needs; and those seeking
to study user activity to improve value and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will show how this tool provides high value to centers and
their users as it can provide documentation on how an application was
built to provide reproducibility by reporting the exact environment in
which jobs were run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been running XALT at Texas Advanced Computing Center,
one of the largest supercomputers in the world and it has become
mission critical for us to know what programs to benchmark for
new systems.  It has also told us what programs that shouldn't
be running on the large memory nodes. We will also describe using
analytics on the big data generated through XALT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XALT has a small but growing community.  It is also tracking usage
at major sites around the world: NICS, NCSA, Univ. of Utah, KAUST.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With Docker v1.9 a new networking system was introduced, which allows multi-host networking to work out-of-the-box in any Docker environment. This talk provides an introduction on what Docker networking provides, followed by a demo that spins up a full SLURM cluster across multiple machines.
The demo is based on QNIBTerminal, a Consul backed set of Docker Images to spin up a broad set of software stacks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>MPP databases ♥ GPGPU</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The intersection of massively parallel processing (MPP) databases and general-purpose programming on graphics processors (GPGPU) affords incredible compute capabilities to scientists and analysts. This talk will showcase the marriage of well-established, open source MPP database infrastructure and cutting edge data-level parallelism using GPGPU. Some examples will be shown using a hosted, cluster environment to showcase the ease of implementation. Pending disclosure authorization, some real-world use cases will be discussed as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal is to showcase the integration of database user-defined functions (UDFs) and the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) compute capabilities available to programmers on modern GPU devices - all with open source software. I will speak to the motivation for doing this and briefly demonstrate the required infrastructure and effort. The applications of this technique span a wide range of industries and use-cases; pending disclosure authorization, I will highlight a few of these. I plan to keep the content comprehensible to an audience familiar with any or all of the following (MPP, SQL UDFs, Python, CUDA, OpenCL) although I will briefly outline the importance of each as they relate to this technology showcase (and at large). I am hoping for a more even split between Q&amp;amp;A and content delivery as this tends to be the most engaging for the audience (and myself).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We all know there is more data than ever before. We do our best to optimize the computation of data, but our tools and techniques haven't kept up. The need for a new approach to query optimization has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This motivates the development of ORCA, now a fully open-source query optimizer that is designed to work with any database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORCA has achieved a 1000x performance improvement across TPC-DS queries by focusing on three distinct areas: Dynamic Partition Elimination, SubQuery Unnesting, and Common Table Expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORCA is the default query optimizer in the open-source databases, Greenplum Database -- RDBMS data warehouse solution, and Apache HAWQ --  a SQL on Hadoop solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addison will give an overview of ORCA’s architecture, where the project is headed, and how to get involved.

        <title>Big Data meets Fast Data: an scalable hybrid real-time transactional and analytics solution </title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Data transactions (OLTP) and analytics (OLAP) have long been treated as very different concerns. Analyzing high volume transactional data traditionally required complex and hard to maintain ELT / ETL integration batches that ran overnight, causing any insights to be based on data that is already outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we could transact data very fast, on an open-source horizontally high scalable NoSQL system, and that data be automatically and constantly written to a massive parallel analytical database - allowing near real-time transactions and analytics?&lt;br/&gt;
What if we could cache back on the transactional system any analytical data insights or machine learning algorithm results, pushing those analytical findings back to the applications, allowing real closed-loop analytics?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces an open-source solution that integrates the fastest scalable, highly available and fully consistent In-Memory Data Grid (Apache Geode / GemFire) to the first open-source massive parallel data warehouse (Greenplum Database) in a hybrid  transactional and analytical architecture that is extremely fast, horizontally scalable, highly resilient and open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session also features a live demo, showing a real case of real-time closed-loop analytics and machine learning using the featured solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Data streaming is gaining popularity, as it offers decreased latency, a radically simplified data infrastructure architecture, and the ability to cope with new data that is generated continuously. Apache Flink is a full-featured stream processing framework with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use Java- and Scala-embedded APIs that make stream analytics easy, yet provide powerful tools to deal with time and uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughput of million of events per second per core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latencies as low as the millisecond range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exactly-once consistency guarantees, and the ability to realize distributed transactional data movement between systems (e.g., between Kafka and HDFS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of configuration and separation between application logic and fault tolerance via a novel asynchronous checkpointing algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No single point of failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with popular open source infrastructure (e.g., Hadoop, HBase, Kafka, Cascading, Elasticsearch, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for event time and out of order arrivals with flexible windows, watermarks, and triggers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch processing as a special case of stream processing, including dedicated libraries for machine learning and graph processing, managed memory on-, and off-heap, and query optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Flink is used in several companies, including at ResearchGate, Bouygues Telecom, the Otto Group, and Capital One, and has a large and active developer community of well over 140 contributors. In this talk, we provide an overview of the system and its streaming-first philosophy, as well as the project roadmap and vision: fully unifying the, now separate, worlds of “batch” and “streaming” analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Batch processing has been, until recently, the standard model for big data. Largely, this is due to the very large influence of the original processing MapReduce implementation in Hadoop and the difficulty in replacing MapReduce in the original Hadoop framework.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Batch processing has been, until recently, the standard model for big data. Largely, this is due to the very large influence of the original processing MapReduce implementation in Hadoop and the difficulty in replacing MapReduce in the original Hadoop framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, there has been a shift to streaming architectures using tools such as Apache Spark and Kafka. These architectures offer surprisingly large benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness, but they are also surprisingly different from previous message queuing designs. The changes in these new systems allow enormously higher scalability and make fault tolerance relatively simple to achieve while maintaining good latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe the key design tools and best practice techniques used in modern systems including percolators, the big-data oscilloscope, replayable queues, state-point queuing and universal micro-architectures. The benefits that I will highlight include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a decrease in total system complexity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;flexible throughput/latency trade-offs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fault tolerance without the difficulties of the lamdba architecture and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;easy debuggability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will detail several Apache projects that attempt to support flow computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LLVM has been around for over a decade and is more popular than ever. Its combination of an easy to use API coupled with high quality documentation has lowered the barrier to compiler development significantly.
This has led to a strong adoption of LLVM in many different areas and as a result we can see a wide range of projects using LLVM today. Projects using LLVM cover a large spectrum of domains, ranging from classic C/C++ toolchains to code obfuscation engines and binary translators.
The vast number of different projects based on LLVM and the fact that new projects are appearing constantly makes it increasingly hard to keep track of all of them.
This talk attempts to summarize the current landscape of projects which are using LLVM in one way or another.
The focus of this talk is on projects using LLVM rather than the LLVM compiler infrastructure itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a tale of four browser vendors, seeking new languages and capabilities while staying fast, secure and portable. The old JavaScript wizard still has many spells under its belt, but it seeks a companion on its quest to reach VM utopia. WebAssembly is that companion.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this quest, mad alchemist Dan and jester JF will detail their exploration of LLVM-land. You’ll get to witness firsthand their exploration of ISel and MI, hear of their wondrous encounter with MC, and gasp at the Spell of Restructuring wherein SSA+CFG is transmuted into regs+AST. Will our adventurers conquer the Target and capture the virtual ISA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us in this exciting tale to which &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the hero!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This will present the different tools LLVM/Clang provides for C++ development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a very long time, the C++ developer's toolbox has been rather empty. The LLVM project has started to shift things: beside providing Clang, a C/C++/ObjC compiler, it also comes with several handy tools for developers: code completion, diagnostics (and fix-it), reformating, sanitizers, ...
This presentation will give an overview of those tools and how to use them in a working environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LLVM is available for many CPU architectures. In this talk I share my experience in porting LLVM to a new OS based on a supported CPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;LLVM is available for many CPU architectures. Because there exists many different OSs you may encounter the situation that the CPU architecture of your OS is supported but not your OS itself. In order to natively run LLVM on such an OS you need to port LLVM. In this talk I share my experience in porting LLVM to AIX. LLVM supports Linux on PowerPC so aiming for AIX supports seems reasonable. I show the approach I took and which parts of LLVM must be modified, including how to tweak the MC layer to utilize an external assembler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AAP: An Altruistic Processor</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An Altruistic Processor (AAP) is an open hardware 16-bit architecture for deeply embedded applications running on small FPGA devices.  It is somewhat configurable, with a minimum of 4 16-bit general registers, at least one word-addressed code space of up to 16Mword and at least one byte addressed data space of up to 64kbyte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary role of AAP is as a test bench for compiler backends.  It encapsulates features found in a wide range of popular embedded processors which traditionally cause difficulties for compiler writers.  By contributing it to the official LLVM distribution we hope to provide a solution to these problems for many such compilers..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Clang/LLVM implementation for AAP has been submitted as a patch to the mainline development (patches D12191 and D12192). In this talk we will discuss our experience implementing and testing LLVM for this architecture, the architectural features unique to our processor and how these interact with LLVM.  In AAP integers are less than 32-bits, pointers may be word addressed, not unique, and too large to fit in a registers (of which there may be very few).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;A key part of any implementation of an embedded toolchain is a simulator of the architecture, both such that user written code can be run and so the compiler's implementation itself can be verified. As part of AAP, we have implemented a simulator based on LLVM MC that both runs standalone and as part of a gdb/lldbserver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will discuss the design and my experiences of using LLVM as the host for a simulator.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Jancy</title>
        <subtitle>Scripting Language for IO and UI programming</subtitle>
        <track>LLVM Toolchain</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jancy is a scripting programming language with LLVM back-end. Jancy offers a lot of convenient features for low-level IO (input-output) and UI (user-interface) programming which are not found in mainstream languages (and sometimes, nowhere else). This includes safe pointer arithmetics, high level of source-level and ABI compatibility with C/C++, reactive UI programming, built-in generator of incremental lexers/scanners and a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why create yet another programming language? Like, there isn't enough of them already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have asked myself these questions hundreds of times, over and over again. I can name dozens of possible arguments against creating a new programming language. I understand all the difficulties a language creator is doomed to face before he can gather any meaningful number of users of the new language. And I still believe that creation of Jancy was justified. The truth is, Jancy was not created just to fix the infamous fatal flaw of other languages (aka, &lt;em&gt;they didn't write it&lt;/em&gt;). Of course, the passion to invent was a significant driving force, but there was &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; reasoning besides that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During development of a product called IO Ninja (a universal all-in-one low-level IO debugger) we were looking for a scripting language with the support for safe pointers and safe pointer arithmetics. After not finding one, we basically had a choice of either settling for some existing alternative (like, embedded Python) -- or create a new language tailor-suited for this task. Create it both for ourselves, and for other developers who could be in need for a scripting language really good at handling binary data. Needless to say, we have chosen the later option -- otherwise, you would not be reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, besides featuring safe pointers and safe pointer arithmetics, Jancy offers a long list of other useful features not found in most mainstream languages (and sometimes, nowhere else). So let's outline the distinguishing features of Jancy below. And for those of you wondering &lt;em&gt;what's in a name&lt;/em&gt;, Jancy is an acronym: [in-between] Java-and-C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Design Principles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented scripting language for IO and UI programming with C-family syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABI compatibility with C/C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic memory management via accurate GC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLVM as a back-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Key Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe pointers and pointer arithmetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High level of source compatibility with C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in Reactive Programming support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in regexp-based generator of incremental lexers/scanners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Other Notable Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception-style syntax over error code checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties (the most comprehensive implementation thereof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multicasts and events (including weak events, which do not require to unsubscribe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Const-correctness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread local storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak pointers (that do not retain objects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partial application for functions and properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduled function pointers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitflag enums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl-style formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hexadimal, binary and multi-line literals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How to use LLVM C API with Swift</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM Toolchain</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Abstract &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation shows how to use LLVM C API with Swift programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following topics are covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Obtaining and building LLVM
- Linking simple Swift program against LLVM libraries
- Creating a simple Swift program that does the following:
    - creates an LLVM module in memory
    - creates an LLVM function in memory
    - creates an LLVM execution engine in memory
    - runs the function using the engine
    - deals with input parameters of function
    - deals with returning result from function
- Concluding the topic with an example of Kaleidoscope language implemented in Swift
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Expected audience level &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginners in Swift and LLVM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Motivation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the public release of Swift more and more people find the language attractive. As a side effect more and more people are trying to learn internals, dig deeper and to get know how the system works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of the presentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    - to show people far from compilers that using LLVM is not a rocket science, and rather easy
    - attract more people into the LLVM community
    - appeal to people to learn existing tools and build new tools on top of it
    - highlight Swift’s readiness to be used not only for customer apps development
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; About the Author &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Alex. I work as a Software Developer for about 5 years now. I do write some useful stuff about Clang and LLVM here - http://lowlevelbits.org. Previously I gave some talks about LLVM/Clang/Swift internals for local developer communities (https://speakerdeck.com/AlexDenisov).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mostly focus on iOS app development, though my hobby is Compiler Construction. I became an LLVM/Clang committer one year ago and managed to implement couple of features for Clang (new warning and ObjC language extension) and fixed couple of small bugs. I’m eagerly learning LLVM at the moment and trying to spreading the word about compilers to attract more people into this wonderful field of software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LLVM's Libfuzzer is uniquely suited for fuzzing components of client/server applications such as PostgreSQL. I'll present blockers preventing other tools such as AFL from being used effectively in such an environment and why Libfuzzer works much better for us. I can demonstrate (not a live demonstration!) the resulting Postgres module which presents an interface to call arbitrary SQL functions with fuzzed inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM Toolchain</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the MACH project, we are working on transparent compilation toolchain for heterogeneous targets (CPUs, GPUs, ManyCores). Starting from the R language, we have built a higher level intermediate representation on top of the LLVM-IR, to benefit from a well defined target for the front-end generation and to reuse the LLVM optimization passes framework over that IR. The compiler generates LLVM-IR proper, integrated with a dataflow oriented, heterogeneous capable high performance runtime (StarPU). This talk will describe the higher-level IR and how the required transformations were implemented as LLVM passes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Automated tracking of performance of compiler-generated code.</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>LLVM Toolchain</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that top-of-trunk consistently generates high-quality code
remains harder than it should be. Continuous integration (CI) setups
that track correctness of top-of-trunk work pretty well today since
they automatically report correctness regressions with low false
positive rate to committers. In comparison, the output generated by CI
setups that track performance require far more human effort to
interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll describe why I think effective performance tracking
is hard and what problems need solving, with a focus on our real world
experiences and observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the bring-up of one of the public performance tracking
bots, I’ve done an in-depth analysis of its performance and noise
characteristics. The insights gained from this analysis drove a number
of improvements to LNT and the test-suite in the past year. I hope
that sharing these insights will help others in setting up low-noise
performance-tracking bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll conclude by summarizing what seem to be the most important
missing pieces of CI functionality to make the performance-tracking
infrastructure as effective as the correctness-tracking
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation has been given before at the US LLVM dev meeting
in San Jose. Given the interest there and the mostly non-overlapping
audience between the FOSDEM llvm dev room and the US dev meeting, I
think it's worthwhile to repeat this presentation at FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk gives a hands-on technical overview of Sulong, a LLVM IR interpreter written in Java on top of the Truffle framework which will be released under a BSD 3-Clause License within the next few weeks.
Sulong uses Graal as a JIT compiler which performs aggressive optimizations to reach native execution speeds.
We will shortly explain the concepts of Truffle and Graal, to then focus on Sulong itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will present how to get started hacking Sulong, and use the mx build tool of the Truffle/Graal ecosystem.
We use the Truffle Domain Specific Language (DSL) to implement LLVM IR operations as AST nodes, and we will demonstrate how Graal optimizes and compiles the AST.
Subsequently, we demonstrate how we implement speculative optimizations such as value profiling, profile based inlining, branch probability injection, inlining of function pointer calls, and other dynamic optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We show how Sulong uses the Java Unsafe API to access native memory and implement pointers. By using the Graal Foreign Native Interface Sulong can call native libraries directly from Java code. Virtual registers from LLVM bitcode are mapped to the Truffle Frame implementation which gets escape-analyzed and thus ensures fast access to local variables. We show how we map some of the common data types such as I32 directly to Java primitives, and how we map others such as the X86 80 bit floating point to custom Java types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we give you an outline of the things we still want to implement in Sulong, and how other Truffle languages can use Sulong as their native interfaces, and perform function inlining and optimizations over language boundaries.
We will also present how we want to use Truffle and the Java platform to implement security features such as efficient integer overflow value tagging and memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>NIR on the Mesa i965 backend</title>
        <subtitle>A case for a faster and simpler driver</subtitle>
        <track>Graphics</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you are running Linux on an Intel GPU, chances are that your graphics driver just got much better.
Mesa, the most popular open source OpenGL implementation, has got a new intermediate language to represent GLSL shader programs. It is called NIR, and is based on modern knowledge on compilers and GPU architecture. The Intel i965 driver is fully powered by NIR now, after support to non-scalar shaders has been recently added.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will give the audience a tour around the work done during 2015, that culminated in the rewrite of the i965 non-scalar backend to use NIR, and was released in Mesa 11.0. It will present a brief technical overview of how NIR integrates into a Mesa backend, some important considerations, and the main challenges we faced. It will also illustrate the benefits of the new backend by comparing to the old one in terms of performance and backend code complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Compute Support for Nouveau</title>
        <subtitle>Creating a LLVM to TGSI and a SPIR-V to NV50 IR backends</subtitle>
        <track>Graphics</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at the work recently done to enable compute support on GPUs supported by Nouveau. The focus of the talk will be on generating a representation of the OpenCL code that can be consumed by Nouveau, which is the biggest missing piece to get OpenCL running on Nouveau.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GPGPU support is something which is becoming more and more important nowadays. This means that besides trying to catch-up with the latest OpenGL revisions, opensource gpu drivers also need to add support for Compute programs through OpenCL and/or CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at the various bits and pieces involved in adding Compute support to Nouveau. The main focus of the talk will be the translation from OpenCL to Nouveau GPU machine-code. This translation typically includes multiple passes translating from one &lt;em&gt;intermediate representation&lt;/em&gt; (IR) to another. Which new passes can we introduce to get Compute support? What are the advantages / disadvantages of chosing a specific translation / compile pass to get Compute support?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this global overview this talk will look in detail on two different approaches that implement different backends. The first work reuses the fact that Nouveau can consume TGSI, by implementing a LLVM IR to TGSI pass, meaning that it is driver independent. On the other hand, the second work teaches Nouveau how to consume SPIR-V, which is the intermediate representation being used by Vulkan for all shaders and compute programs. This makes it possible for Nouveau to consume directly a SPIR-V binary (if the shader / compute program has been pre-compiled), rather than going back to LLVM IR before being converted to TGSI and fed into Nouveau.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Simulation to Aid Developing Software for Hardware</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Graphics</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Developing software to run directly on hardware is hard.  Implementing a simulator for the target hardware can help alleviate much of this pain.  Techniques and best practices learned from several simulation environments for vastly different hardware will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hardware is funny stuff.  It is often documented to work one way when it actually works a slightly different way.  Different revisions of the hardware may have different bugs that require different sets of work-arounds.  Programming it even slightly incorrectly can lead to software crashes or system hangs.  Sometimes some versions of the hardware work fine, but the version not on the developer's desk crashes.  Failure modes are often opaque and give no clues for fixing the problem.  Writing robust, reliable software to run directly on hardware is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software simulation of hardware is a technique that, in many cases, can alleviate some of this pain.  Teams that develop hardware will often create a simulator as a by-product of hardware synthesis.  Not ever developer is fortunate to have access to such tools.  Those who do have access often find them slow or difficult to use.  After all, these simulators are generally created as an aid for the hardware developers themselves.  Much of the benefit of a full hardware simulator can be attained by developing the simulator independently from the hardware development.  When the correct techniques are applied, it's not even that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a variety of techniques based on experience with several "home grown" simulation environments.  Techniques for both developing and validating the simulator and techniques for integrating simulation in the regular development process will be described.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;u-boot offers us multiple ways to boot a system and lots of flexibility. For a user new to ARM or any other architecture supported by u-boot it a confusing mix of hex, commands and wrapped things. Working with upstream u-boot we have come up with a way to make things simpler for users. This talk will cover what has been done, what the syntax is (spoiler it is syslinux format with 2 options for dtb handling), What can be done to make things even better and some of the distros onboard and adopting the standard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Please note that this talk has been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cockpit is a discoverable admin interface. Cockpit makes Linux usable by a far more sysadmins. Cockpit is on by default in Fedora Server, and available on RHEL, CentOS, Atomic, Debian, Arch and others.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at how Cockpit is designed. It's zero footprint and starts on demand, without a heavy backend, but just enough server-side logic to let a browser talk directly with system APIs. This also means that admins are not limited to Cockpit, but can use other tools, or the terminal, along side it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cockpit interacts heavily with all corners of the system. Because of that we rely heavily on continuous integration. In this talk we'll show how the Cockpit project boots and tests real operating systems many thousands of times a day, and does continuous delivery into distros as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Fedora Community Operations (CommOps) team has been compiling statistics and metrics about community activity within Fedora. This data will be used to inform strategic decisions on how to invest scarce project resources in our volunteer-driven community. We will also include some analysis and retrospective conclusions about future releases of the Operating System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools used to compile metrics, graphics, and visualizations used in this talk will be made available under FOSS licenses, as they may be useful for other distros and projects outside of Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will make heavy use of graphs, charts, and data visualizations, with a goal of quickly capturing a number of activity vectors to be presented in interesting and engaging ways. An extensive Q&amp;amp;A session will be a big part of this presentation, so the audience can get ample explanation of both results and tools used to generate them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A universal system description describes the content of a system. It can be stored, compared, analyzed and modified. You can also use it to replicate a system or even migrate it to a newer version or a different distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chances are high that you interact with multiple Linux distributions and keeping track of the them and their differences is no easy task. Even if you pick one flavor the variation between one version and the next may be abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A universal system description describes the content of a system. It can be stored, compared, analyzed and modified. You can also use it to replicate a system or even migrate it to a newer version or a different distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will explain how this concept is being used inside Machinery in order to do something called "offline systems management" and the challenges that are faced when you want to reduce the gap between Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The CentOS CI is a public resource that open source based projects can
use for integration tests on bare metal hardware. The goal of the
project is to be a resource for communities that build on top of CentOS
in order to enable them to perform better automated testing. Down the
line this infrastructure will be developed into a full pipeline for building
and testing containers. This talk will give an overview of the CentOS CI
as well as a quick start to getting started with the project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The CentOS CI is a public resource that open source based projects can
use for integration tests on bare metal hardware. The goal of the
project is to be a resource for communities that build on top of CentOS
in order to enable them to perform better automated testing. Down the
line this infrastructure will be developed into a full pipeline for building
and testing containers. How do I get access and how do I get started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a formal process for requesting access to the CI, but after
you have access there is a need to understand the infrastructure a
bit. The infrastructure currently is built using a bare metal provisioning
mechanism, known as Duffy, that provisions machines based on REST api
calls. It then uses Jenkins to kick off tests on the provisioned
hardware, typically by pulling test repos from git and executing them.
Test results can then be viewed at the ci.centos.org dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview of the CI project and the related
infrastructure as well as give a quick guide to getting started and
writing your firsts tests on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CoreOS is a new Linux distribution designed specifically for application containers and running them at scale. This talk will examine all the major components of CoreOS including etcd, rkt, docker, Kubernetes and systemd; and how these components work together to solve the infrastructure problems of today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last decade was about virtual machines and the next decade is about containers. Containers enable a service to run on any host at any time. Traditional tools were not designed for this level of application portability. Now is the time to get started with new emerging methods to deploy and manage applications at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Use of real-time communications (voice, video and chat) in free software communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many communities have started running some kind of RTC infrastructure, such as &lt;a href="https://rtc.debian.org"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; (SIP, XMPP and WebRTC), &lt;a href="https://www.gnome.org/foundation/membership/apply/"&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; (XMPP) and the &lt;a href="https://fedrtc.org"&gt;FedRTC.org&lt;/a&gt; service for Fedora (SIP, WebRTC).  Some other communities are still debating the concept or trying to decide where to start.  This session will look at questions like: where do we start?  What is the support overhead?  Can we do &lt;a href="https://meet.jit.si"&gt;multi-party video calling&lt;/a&gt; entirely with free software?  Is &lt;a href="http://rtcquickstart.org"&gt;federation&lt;/a&gt; feasible, functional and worthwhile?  How can this type of communication strengthen the connection people have with the community and their participation in the long term?  How can the pub/sub and notification features of these services integrate with automated systems, such as &lt;a href="http://fedmsg.org"&gt;FedMsg&lt;/a&gt; in Fedora?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>State of arm64</title>
        <subtitle>What's broken on arm64?</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Arm64 (aka Aarch64) is now fully available in distros. Nearly everything is built, with a few annoying exceptions. However quite a lot of stuff may not actually work very well, or may run embarassingly slowly. We want to know what's broken so we can fix it! This talk is intended to kick off this process of finding all the breakage and room for optimisations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The arm64 port is now in pretty good shape with most things ported and built. However we know that there is plenty of software that is not optimised and some may not actually work at all. Please come along and moan about anything you have found which doesn't work as well on arm64 as it does on x86. We (Linaro, ARM and Debian) want your feedback on where to direct effort next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the current status of the port, and of hardware availability. Only a few things are completely missing, but we know that a lot of software is using the basic 'fallback support' where other architectures have specific optimisations. Some stuff is probably building, but not actually working right. We are keen to fix things that are actively getting in the way of using arm64 in real systems, but to do that we need feedback from users on what to look at next as we move from mostly enablement to mostly optimisation. GCC, OpenJDK, &amp;amp; LLVM are known to be in good shape, but there is a pile of other stuff that probably isn't. It's very hard to test 'all the software in the world', so please tell us about stuff you've noticed not working well, or incredibly slowly, or that you suspect might be a problem and need work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Wither EPEL?</title>
        <subtitle>Harvesting the next generation of software for the enterprise</subtitle>
        <track>Distributions</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EPEL is a repository of packages rebuilt from the Fedora Project and available for use on RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and other *EL-based rebuilds. At FOSDEM 2015 there was a hallway session (literally), where we discussed the challenges of EPEL for users and developers, how to work best across the Fedora and CentOS projects, and how the repository should evolve. This session for FOSDEM 2016 intends to build on that discussion with a round-table of key people from EPEL, Fedora, and EL-rebuilds to discuss amongst themselves and with the audience what's right, what's wrong, how to fix, and what the future of EPEL should be.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;EPEL has long been the filler gap that makes using an EL-based distro more sane for people not versed in building and maintaining their own packages. Being a curated set of packages, there is a higher trust level expected of the EPEL contributors by the end-users -- a promise that things will go slowly (like the RHEL releases), won't break on minor update (like the RHEL releases), and won't overwrite packages in the base EL distro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, EPEL comes from a time when getting packages from your Linux distribution was the best and most trusted way to use vetted and secure software. Software is now delivered in more ways than an RPM package -- containers and cloud images to name two key methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an active relationship between the Fedora and CentOS projects, there have been various proposals about where the build system and repository should exist. In addition, the CentOS Project has layered projects on top of the platform who use the SIG process to provide even newer software for their end-users, where EPEL is often a key dependency. There are a number of technical and social issues to consider in terms of how Fedora as an upstream and the EL rebuilds as downstream need to hold and consume the EPEL bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience for this discussion are the systems administrators and devops engineers who are end-users of EPEL, either directly or indirectly (because they use a container that builds from EPEL, for example.) They come from myriad situations -- academia, scientific computing, corporations, non-governmental/non-profit organizations, and so forth. Their key similarity is a reliance on the EPEL promise of slow-moving, curated packages and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this audience, the round-table is a chance to tell core EPEL contributors what is going well and what is a challenge in the current setup. It is also a chance to have a front-row seat and input on the future of EPEL from technical and community perspectives. Finally it is a chance for finding solutions with other technologies and forming the communities which can deal with new stuff/slow change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People we have or are asking to be on the round-table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dennis Gilmore -- Fedora Releng representative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Stinson -- CentOS downstream representative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heikel Guemar or Alan Pevec? -- OpenStack/RDO packager user of EPEL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBD -- CERN end-user representative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBD -- Scientific Linux downstream representative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karanbir Singh? -- CentOS technical and project lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt Miller? -- Fedora project lead/Board representative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBD -- an EPEL packager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBD -- another EPEL big end-user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TBD -- Fedora Packaging Committee member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While Haiku uses its own native graphical interface and GUI toolkit, and aims for maximum GUI coherence, not being a mainstream OS in the FLOSS ecosystem means porting applications is necessary to having a fully usable system more quickly. We'll look at the current status and limitations of ported GUI toolkits on Haiku, and expected roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Haiku's graphical interface is different from most FLOSS OSes around, as it does not make use of X11, which has consequences on the availability of various known GUI toolkits. Indeed, most of them are quite dependent on X11 features, or sometimes lack features which are already present in X11, leading to applications improperly bypassing the toolkit. Also, since the native toolkit is only available as a C++ API, further concerns arise when porting them over. And the limited number of developers also means some old widespread toolkits aren't yet available while more recent ones already are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the advent of proper package management and a port system recently accelerated Haiku's development, leading to many new ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll detail which toolkits are usable, and what's missing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Genode as Desktop OS</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Desktops</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Genode is a component-based operating system developed from the ground up to counter most security issues that plague us today, like spyware, viruses, and zero-day exploits. It combines microkernel technology, capability-based security, and virtualization with a unique component architecture. Developed over the course of 8 years, the project has finally evolved to a state where its developers use it as their desktop OS. The talk will give an introduction into Genode and demonstrate its unique takes on desktop computing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the free-software community, there is very little competition that challenges the predominant POSIX-based operating systems like Linux and FreeBSD. It's a universal truth that the creation of a new general-purpose operating system from scratch is infeasible due to the enormous amount of work needed to develop device drivers, libraries, and applications. Since most users seem to be content with the current POSIX-based state of the art, good arguments would be needed to justify such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security and privacy are such arguments. In times when threats like identity theft, the leakage of personal information, business espionage, spyware, and even targeted attacks become prevalent, the current generation of commodity OSes remain inherently vulnerable to zero-day exploits and privilege escalation, and leave the end user largely unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genode is a new operating-system architecture that promises to prevent most classes of security problems by design. Genode-based systems are created out of surprisingly simple primitives: Each program runs in a dedicated sandbox and gets granted only those rights and resources that are needed for its actual task. Programs can create and manage sub-sandboxes out of their own resources, thereby forming hierarchies where policies can be enforced at each level. Thanks to this rigid regime, the attack surface of security-critical functions can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared to contemporary operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 8 years of development, the project has reached a state where a small group of enthusiasts use it as their primary OS. This was made possible by the virtue of embedding a wealth of open-source projects as components into the new system. For the use as desktop OS, Genode integrates Qt5, VirtualBox, Intel KMS, the GNU utilities, the Linux USB stack, the Intel wireless stack, Rump kernels, and a number of custom components into a completely new system composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will first introduce the basic concepts behind Genode, contrasting its architecture to current-generation OSes. The second part of the talk will demonstrate how Genode approaches desktop computing and how it is used as day-to-day OS on the speaker's laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The story of Enlightenment, EFL, Tizen &amp;amp; Wayland&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will cover, from a high level, what Wayland is, how it is
theoretically better than X11 (and why you should not expect massive
speedups compared to a well tuned X11 world), why Wayland is good,
what was involved in preparing a move to Wayland, some of the issues,
and issues still yet to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tizen has been on the path to Wayland for some time, Enlightenment
has of course adapted and become a complete Wayland compositor as of
version 0.20. So not only has a WM had to move, but a toolkit and a
whole platform as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should provide some insight on Wayland, what is needed to port to
it and why it should exist and be used at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The KDE community has always strongly believed in free and open source software. Today, we are taking this mission one step further, by bringing openness to the most important intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. We are not alone: to ensure full-scale success we are partnering with the most prestigious research institutions and universities all over the globe.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine notes and text books, tailored precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customize the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Ubuntu Personal is a secure system for converged desktop, laptop, and mobile devices, with transaction updates and apps with bundled dependencies.  Problem is, the old stuff we may depend on to do our day-to-day work may not be immediately available to run natively.  To help that transition, Ubuntu has a plan that will have traditional software packages running sandboxed in containers.  This is a quick overview of how that sandbox works, including a demonstration of it in action.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an overview of a facility that will be available with Ubuntu Personal that will allow X11-based Deb-packaged software to run under a Mir-based Unity 8 environment on a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, or whatever that thing with the flashing lights is sitting in the closet.  Setting the stage by describing how Ubuntu Personal uses a transactionally updated read-only system and snappy package bundles, a description of how deb packages can be installed, updated, and run in a sandbox container will be followed by actual live demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Telepathy is the API used in many popular Linux desktops for integrated real-time communications.  Existing protocol support in Telepathy has had some rough edges, especially for NAT traversal, but things are now changing with the emergence of the telepathy-resiprocate component and other developments.

        <title>Make backups and versions available easy.</title>
        <subtitle>Provide access to previous versions to users.</subtitle>
        <track>Desktops</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of backup software for Linux, but I always miss easy access to backups and versions. This project provides that access, using different advanced tools like btrfs (to create snapshots), sqlite (to administer the differences between snapshots) and a FUSE filesystem to browse and read access the different available versions. I'm working on integration with filemanager Dolphin and a tool to show differences between two office files.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Btrfs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people know btrfs is being used to create system snapshots. In this project it is used to create snapshots of users private directories. It's not required that the directory to backup is on a btrfs. The contents of this directory is first synchronized with a backup directory on a btrfs, and of this backup directory snapshots are created. This is done at the start of a session of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using mimetypes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a backup, most of the time you want that only files of a specific type or types are taken into account, not all the files. For example a folder for development of a C executable. You want the source and the header files to backup, but not object and other temporary files required for building. Another example: a folder with odt files, you only want to backup those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this project the user can assign different mimetypes to a directory, and only files of these types will be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Sqlite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a snapshot is created, the differences between the directory and it's backup are analyzed and administered in sqlite.
So every file and version are stored in sqlite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Fuse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available is a backup directory, snapshots of this map, and a sqlite db where all the files and theur versions are stored.  To provide easy access to the backup and versions of files, a Fuse fs is used. It provides a browseable set of directories, where the contents represents the files (and subdirectories), and versions of files are readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work to be done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a simple qt gui to browse the different personal backups, and get and set the options. I want to create easy access to versions through the main tools in KDE like Dolphin. I've been looking at the existing versioncontrolplugin API of Dolphin, but it looks like it's not exactly what I'm looking for. I think another backup API is required. With this it must be possible to just right click on files (which are part of a backup), clicking on "Show versions" menuitem, and Dolphin expands the file with the versions available. Also possible should be to compare a previous version with the current file, using the right tools. For office files this is also work to be done, but is possible to build a viewer to compare the differences using LibreOfficeKit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Eolian: automatic EFL binding generation and more</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Desktops</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I will describe how we use the Eolian Domain Specific Language to
handle automatic generation of EFL bindings for different languages&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The EFL is a suite of libraries for cross platform application development
written in C. However, most people prefer using higher level languages for
application development, which makes bindings necessary. Writing bindings
by hand is not an easy task; their later maintenance is even worse, which
in the past resulted in our bindings getting obsolete fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago EFL got its own object system called Eo. This object system
forms the basis of our API infrastructure; as one of the advantages, it
allows for potential automatic language bindings. While Eo provides an
appropriate runtime, it's not enough - which is why we also came up with
a declarative interface description language in which the EFL APIs
are described, allowing for all sorts of processing and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe how we use this language (called Eolian) to
handle automatic generation of EFL bindings for different languages. I'm
going to show examples of different generator types (for dynamic languages,
particularly Lua, as well as statically typed compiled languages such as
C++) as well as provide examples of Eolian usage for different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;CMake provides "generators" for creating files understood by user tools
such as IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In many cases, this provides enough information to build a
C++ code model for project files, but provides little information to
create an effective model of the CMake code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some tools manage
to provide native support for CMake code and offer features such as
build system and compilation information, syntax highlighting, semantic
code-completion, debugging and validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce how to make 3rd-party IDE integration easier to maintain,
more reliable and more feature-full.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A tour through some lesser known features, subcommands, and recipes for doing interesting things with ZFS, presented by the co-author of "FreeBSD Mastery: ZFS"&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ZFS is well known for being a rock solid storage system with a plethora of features. Yet, most users are unaware of just how powerful ZFS is. ZFS is so fundamentally different from other file systems that new and interesting things are possible. This presentation will demonstrate a number of very interesting configurations that sysadmins, developers, and others may find very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation starts with a very brief summary of ZFS's features, then immediately delves into interesting hacks.
 * Script-ability of ZFS
 * Abusing properties and inheritance
 * Mount point trickery
 * Delegation hacks and recipes
 * Applying limits to users and containers
 * Using ZFS to juggle development workflows
 * ZFS replication for conference attendees and road warriors
 * Lesser known subcommands
 * Abusing zdb
 * Storing configuration in ZFS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be followed by an overview of recent and upcoming developments in OpenZFS, and then questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The FreeBSD Graphics stack would greatly benefit from contributions from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, it is difficult for most people to know how to help, first because our Graphics stack is lagging behind, second because our workflow is opaque and communication too scarse. After a status update on the Graphics stack on FreeBSD, we want to present our workflow and ways to participate to the effort, both in the Ports tree and the kernel. The Graphics stack is a challenging and very interesting beast. Despite the complexity, it is way easier to work on it than one may think, yet very rewarding!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It's been more than a year since FreeBSD gained support for running as a Xen host, but there's still a lot of ongoing work on both FreeBSD and Xen in order to improve the features and the performance of FreeBSD as a guest and a host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the latest improvements in FreeBSD related to Xen support, and the new features being developed for Xen itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The goals are to provide information about the latest improvements in both FreeBSD and Xen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removal of the classic Xen PV port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indirect descriptors support for blkfront (Colin Percival).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unmapped IO support for blkfront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code cleanup in preparation for ARM64 support (Julien Grall).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rework of the netfront driver (Wei Liu).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xen improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rework of the PVH implementation inside of Xen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grant table performance improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xSplice (hypervisor live patching).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Performance Monitoring Unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While Haiku is an operating system on its own, and not even a real Unix clone, it does share many concepts, and even reused BSD code in several places. Let's see what BSD brought to Haiku, and what more it could bring.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Haiku operating system, while inspired by the BeOS for its design, also shares common Unix concepts and principles. It is even closer now that BSD kernels get rid of giant locks, while Haiku has been designed for SMP from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the license to the reused FreeBSD network drivers, let's explore what we owe to the BSDs, what is on the agenda, and what would be fun to try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Following the Heartbleed vulnerability OpenBSD forked OpenSSL into LibreSSL. The portable version of LibreSSL was ported to FreeBSD a day after it was released causing a large number of problems with ports. Meanwhile OpenSSL changed its support-lifecycle and will stop supporting current versions very soon. LibreSSL is being actively developed which induces more changes to ports.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My talk will address the changes required to ports to deal with the changes that LibreSSL introduced (and keeps introducing). Additionally I will talk about the support-lifecycle of both the LibreSSL and OpenSSL projects and the impact on operating systems and other software projects. Lastly I will address making OpenSSL in base private and/or replacing FreeBSD's base OpenSSL with LibreSSL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Routing is a seemingly simple field, but with many details as you dive in. This talk intends to give an overview of some of the core methods used in routing, and their uses (which can extend beyond routing), benefits and trade-offs. It intends to tie this in with an overview of Quagga, a Free Software routing software suite, and explain how Quagga can be used to build solutions to routing and other networking problems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;White box switches are making waves in the networking world through inexpensive hardware (Accton, Quanta) and software (Cumulus, Big Switch). But until now there was no fully open source distribution you could run on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenSwitch is that distribution. Yocto-based, it uses well-established components where possible (OVSDB, Quagga) and combines them with a set of task-specific daemons to manage various parts of the system (fand, powerd etc). User interface is through a commandline shell, REST API, web UI or declarative config.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk provides a deep-dive into the Linux kernel's eBPF engine and how iproute2's tc (traffic control) tool is utilizing it through cls_bpf for providing a programmable data plane for network packets. It's perhaps the most flexible and lightweight entity from all tc classifier/actions and can be used for classifying, encap, mangling, forwarding packets, etc. The talk also presents recently upstreamed features that made it into the eBPF architecture, and gives a short intro on how eBPF programs can be developed in restricted C syntax, compiled with llvm and loaded through tc.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>OVS, DPDK and Software Dataplane Acceleration</title>
        <subtitle>Open vSwitch with netdev DPDK</subtitle>
        <track>SDN and NFV</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http:/http://www.openvswitch.org"&gt;Open vSwitch&lt;/a&gt; is a production quality, multilayer virtual switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we discuss the integration of the &lt;a href="http:/http://www.dpdk.org"&gt;DPDK&lt;/a&gt; dataplane into Open vSwitch. We examine the performance improvements when using the DPDK dataplane in Open vSwitch and the challenges of using an alternative dataplane from the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently DPDK presents the best alternative high speed software data
path for support of high speed interfaces in OVS. We have seen DPDK/OVS
provide throughput that can compete with hardware switching fabrics at
close to 40Gb line rates. However, DPDK presents challenges when
compared with the Linux kernel datapath. DPDK lacks refinements
available from over 20 years of development of Linux kernel networking
and devices. Different semantics in DPDK for provisioning interfaces,
the user experience in that they need architecture knowledge for optimum
performance, and a challenging debugging environment are a few of these
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those less familiar, we will begin our talk with a discussion of how
DPDK integrates with OVS by way of the netdev API. We will cover how to
use, deploy and debug OVS with DPDK. We will cover issues of achieving high
performance in real-world scenarios such as host-guest, and guest to guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we talk about the future of supporting ever higher demands for
fast packet switching in OVS and the role of DPDK and other paradigms
for acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Snabb Switch: Riding the HPC wave to simpler, better network appliances</title>
        <subtitle>An experience report with a production-ready lightweight 4-over-6 implementation in Snabb</subtitle>
        <track>SDN and NFV</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Driven by the needs of scientific computing, rapid rises in memory bandwidth have made it possible to implement high-performance network functions in a radically simpler way.  Snabb Switch rides this wave, bypassing the kernel to process network packets in terse Lua, leaving the programmer free to focus on the essence of their problem.  This talk presents our experiences delivering a carrier-grade implementation of "lightweight 4 over 6", an IPv4-as-a-service architecture that tunnels access to the IPv4 internet through specialized Snabb appliances.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We report on our recent experience implementing a carrier-grade virtualized network function, with observations on what it is like to build real-world, high-performance Snabb applications. (and kernel bypass). Each instance runs at essentially line speed on two ten-gigabit Ethernet cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightweight 4-over-6 (lw4o6) defines an IPv4-as-a-service architecture that allows ISPs to internally operate an IPv6-only network, tunneling IPv4 connections between lw4o6-aware endpoints installed at the customer's site (e.g. in OpenWRT) and an internet-facing "lwAFTR".  Lw4o6 was specified in 2015 as RFC 7596 and has the architectural advantage that the carrier-side lwAFTR only needs per-customer state, not per-flow state.  An lw4o6 system can also be configured to share IPv4 addresses between multiple customers as part of an IPv4 exhaustion strategy. It allows IPv4 networks to interoperate smoothly, while a carrier between them runs a pure-IPv6 network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Igalia has built an open source "lwAFTR" implementation that is ready to deploy in production.  We describe the joys of hacking with Snabb, giving a quick intro to Snabb, modern x86, and lw4o6 along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Virtual software-defined networking (SDN) is becoming one of the most interesting and appealing topics in our industry. This talk will cover the challenges of scalability that cloud-scale, distributed virtual SDN solutions face. Duarte will go over the gory details of hardening distributed ARP tables and of replicating the NAT state of distributed routers, all the while ensuring packets are processed at ludicrous speed. The talk will cover the problem space, what tradeoffs are involved, and how these issues are solved in Midonet, an open source network virtualization system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>The MoonGen Packet Generator</title>
        <subtitle>Testing network devices and NFV setups with a fast and flexible packet generator</subtitle>
        <track>SDN and NFV</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MoonGen is a scriptable high-speed packet generator suitable to test network devices or NFV deployments with millions of packets per second at rates of more than 10 Gbit/s.
Each packet is crafted in real time by a user-defined Lua script to ensure the maximum possible flexibility to test complex scenarios.
MoonGen is available as free and open source software &lt;a href="https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2015/papers/p275.pdf"&gt;scientific paper describing it&lt;/a&gt; was published at the Internet Measurement Conference in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;What is MoonGen?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonGen is a flexible high-speed packet generator. It can saturate 10 GbE links with minimum-sized packets while using only a single CPU core by running on top of the packet processing framework DPDK. Linear multi-core scaling allows for even higher rates: We have tested MoonGen with up to 178.5 Mpps at 120 Gbit/s. Moving the whole packet generation logic into user-controlled Lua scripts allows us to achieve the highest possible flexibility. In addition, we utilize hardware features of commodity NICs that have not been used for packet generators previously. A key feature is the measurement of latency with sub-microsecond precision and accuracy by using hardware timestamping capabilities of modern commodity NICs. We address timing issues with software-based packet generators and apply methods to mitigate them with both hardware support and with a novel method to control the inter-packet gap in software. Features that were previously only possible with hardware-based solutions are now provided by MoonGen on commodity hardware. MoonGen is available as free software under the MIT license in our git repository at &lt;a href="https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen"&gt;https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Using MoonGen for Complex Network Tests&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonGen works with a user-defined Lua script that specifies the whole test by executing script code for each packet in real time.
Support for packet reception allows rich tests that distinguish the throughput and latency of multiple different flows to evaluate QoS features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key feature is the precise and accurate measurement of latencies. MoonGen can timestamp thousands of packets per second, providing insights into the latency behavior of a system.
Latency measurents are especially important in virtualized environments that are often plagued by bad worst-case behaviors that manifest in long-tail latencies.
The 99th percentile (the long tail) of the latency is an important performance characteristic of a NFV setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how to use MoonGen to evaluate networking devices and NFV setups with examples from network experiments conducted by the authors of MoonGen. It also discusses how SDN switches can be used to amplify and modify traffic to benchmark devices with speeds of multiple Terabit/s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;More Information on MoonGen&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2015/papers/p275.pdf"&gt;scientific paper describing MoonGen&lt;/a&gt; was published at the Internet Measurement Conference in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Clearwater is designed from the ground up to run in the cloud providing voice, video and messaging services to millions of users, using from the software design principles of the Web – such as horizontal scalability, NoSQL and, statelessness – and building on those to provide the robustness and standards compliance expected of an IMS core at the centre of a telco-grade communications network. Its software-only approach and simple configuration makes it extremely well suited for deployment in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment. It has already been used as an exemplar VNF (virtual network function) by CloudNFV, Cloudify, OPNFV and Canonical, and deployed live as the backbone of the Indoona VoIP service in Italy, and other major service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the key aspects of Clearwater – what an IMS core is and how it fits into a telecommunications network, how Clearwater differs from traditional telecoms appliances, what architectural principles have been followed in building it, how open source has contributed. It will also describe the  work we’ve done to make Clearwater easy to integrate with NFV orchestrators – from the DevOps installation approach, to an etcd-based automatic clustering manager.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SURFnet is the national research network in the Netherlands. We offer         &lt;br/&gt;
(internet) services to the Dutch higher education and research community.     &lt;br/&gt;
Our goal was to get hands on experience with Network Function Virtualisation  &lt;br/&gt;
(NFV) using open source software. We choose to use the OpenDaylight Service   &lt;br/&gt;
Function Chaining (SFC) software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will give a short introduction of NFV and the          &lt;br/&gt;
concepts used in SFC followed by how we used these in a 4K streaming          &lt;br/&gt;
proof of concept (poc). The network functions is the poc were video           &lt;br/&gt;
transcoding functions like grayscaling, adding a logo or text, and            &lt;br/&gt;
mirroring along the Y or X axis.  During the development of this              &lt;br/&gt;
poc we ran into several problems and limitations of both hardware             &lt;br/&gt;
and software. I will explain the multi table limitations of our               &lt;br/&gt;
ASIC based OpenFlow switches and the challenges with MAC and IP               &lt;br/&gt;
address handling in OpenStack VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ronald van der Pol joined SURFnet in 2012 where he scouts and                 &lt;br/&gt;
evaluates new network technologies. His current focus is on SDN,              &lt;br/&gt;
NFV, programmable dataplanes (OpenFlow and P4), multipathing, and             &lt;br/&gt;
end-to-end performance of demanding applications. He holds masters            &lt;br/&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Containerized applications had been the biggest driver for a number of SDN projects which came to life in the last year. There are several challenges that highly-dynamic and fully-distributed container orchestration systems impose on SDN architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation is geared towards anyone working with open source SDN technologies, as well as those who would like to ensure the robustness of their containers' connections / of their container connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several approaches/options for container networking will be presented, including Weave Net, an open source overlay network for Docker containers. We will demonstrate the in-kernel Open vSwitch datapath used in Weave Net; this manages VXLAN tunnel configuration across hosts, without requiring the user to be a networking expert. We will also highlight how Weave Net provides service discovery and load balancing through a robust, distributed DNS. Users don't need to understand the underlying complexity, nor do they need to make changes to their application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Weave Net's engineers will share what is required to deliver this level of user experience, through the implementation decisions they have made.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Users don't need to understand the underlying complexity, nor do they need to make changes to their application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Weave Net's engineers will share what is required to deliver this level of user experience, through the implementation decisions they have made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Treatment of controllers including OpenDaylight and Apache Floodlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioning nodes from controllers via both push and pull models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metric collection both via controller APIs and directly from switches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topology data collection from controller APIs and directly from switches&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Having difficulties with passively testing your infrastructure with old-school supervision software ? Your infrastructure description differs from your monitoring configuration ? Having trouble communicating between ops and monitoring ? Use Salt configuration management to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start using configuration management systems like Salt and describe your infrastructure as code, you can then re-use that description to generate monitoring configuration for various existing monitoring solutions (nagios, shinken, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use Salt to orchestrate the checks and use other data silos to explore your supervision.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Active checks can be automated by Salt by reusing nagios scripts and munin plugins,
collect the data in Graphite and explore them by building graphs in Grafana, finally define alerts with
tools like graphite-beacon or Cabot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopt Salt and its flexibility, modularity and event bus that will add software glue between your
existing applications and help you scale them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will be looking at how to solve some scalability issues in monitoring and migrating from
traditional tools to newer tools while keeping existing developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source Stack used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shinken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nagios-plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grafana&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will go over how and why people are moving from a machine centric view to a service oriented view of deployments and how you can leverage the knowledge and tools used at the machine level to expand to the scale-out, service oriented architecture. This talk will also cover and compare solutions that are both specific to a single configuration management product and others that are agnostic to the underlying configuration management tool&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the implementation of puppet across 15000 servers in a very traditional enterprise organisation. This involved 20 teams of people new to puppet. On top of that 70% of servers were Windows, making this quite an interesting challenge.
The talk will outline the experiences in onboarding puppet in this enterprise environment. Things that worked, things that didn't work and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will demonstrate some of the most awesome features available in the Puppet 4 language. Although Puppet 4 has been out for almost a year (released in April 2015), not many people know about the advanced features it contains. I'll show
* the type system
* data in modules
* advanced error reporting
* resource defaults&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a short grab bag of fixes and interesting changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No prior knowledge of Puppet is required, and all of the topic material is FOSS software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Configuration management is a great tool for helping with hardening and securing servers. But with any addition of new technology comes a new attack vector: Who watches the watchers?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Security is painful. Luckily the invention of configuration management tools has made this process easier, by allowing repeatable configuration for common hardening. However there comes a catch-22: How do we harden the configuration management itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a tool that enables you to change systems at a fundamental level, it's a fairly tempting target for malicious agents, and one that would cause a lot of problems if compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be discussing some general patterns we can use to mitigate these problems:
- Whitelisting "master" API's
- Encrypting sensitive data
- Adding a security element to code review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we'll  talk about some application specific options for some of most popular tools out there, such as Puppet, Chef, Ansible, cfengine and Salt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;DevOps complexity is rising out of control.  Tools like Puppet, Chef
and Ansible get combined with Vagrant, Docker and OpenShift.  Mix in
external logging, authentication services and apis (and api failure)
to stir things up.  Then add runtime dependency management through
gems, pip and cpan, seasoned with OS distribution updates and CI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The promise of tools like Puppet, Chef and Ansible is infrastructure
as code, meaning that you describe your infrastructure through an
executable specification.  That gives you versioning and
repeatability.  For many the question is:  How do I get a good
Puppet/Chef/Ansible description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it often goes like this:  copy as many deployment
recipes as needed, put them together in a file, and ready you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll describe a method to document and explain deployment
recipes to yourself and others.  The method is called Literate DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literate DevOps is a simple method to document and explain your
environment.  It is based on the concept of literate programming and
independent of your DevOps stack and tools.  When you set up a new
system, or modify an existing one, you'll need to document somehow the
inner workings.  With literate DevOps you can describe the system and
at the same time include your executable code/playbooks (Puppet, Chef,
Ansible) and its output into a live document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk focuses on pragmatic advantages of Literate DevOps and I'll
show examples to explain the workings of the method.  You can think of
Literate DevOps as a tool for understanding, documentation, helping
and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At Facebook DNS has many purposes, from inventory, service management, to global load balancer for the www.facebook.com DNS record. It makes managing all those different use cases a challenge when we want to reconcile the ability to be flexible and the need of a stable infrastructure. This talk will show how the configuration is generated and processed by a set of micro services, and also how the DNS servers themselves consume it. It concludes on a small digression about how in addition to the common DNS records we use www.facebook.com to load balance our billion daily active user and make them connect to the closest location.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the pipelines that generates the configuration which is a data driven process, it shows how we aggregate and override configuration for human and machines, how we distribute the configuration and update it but also how we can keep human in control in case of emergency.
It involves presenting most of the tool on which that pipeline relies, which is lots of open source software (TinyDNS, Unbound, Zookeeper, BitTorrent, ExaBGP, Sparts, Thrift, Git, LXC, ...) and a good share of Python Glue.
The real life example of a global load balancer includes a small presentation about how are daily egress and ingress traffic is and how we have the ability to segment users and optimize the network capacity in our point of presence to direct user to those entry points. The configuration of those is based on a system that compute the distance to the user in terms of round trip time and generate the DNS data accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Config Management and Containers: If all containers are equal, why are you proposing I use [chef|puppet|ansible|salt] and containers again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s perception of containers is primarily focused on the “Dockeriziation” of application containers. Or the forward progression pattern of adopting microservice architectures to achieve immutable results. Meaning - Config Management is a direct antipattern..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper answer here is that we can achieve proper microservice patterns, in familiar environments using the tools we’ve had on hand all along. Bringing this knowledge into containers has real world benefits and I’ll show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The demand for managing a large amount of data in a scalable yet reliable and cost-effective way has became more and more relevant in this day and age.
Ceph, a software-defined storage, provides an original solution for this problem and guarantees a resilient and self-healing way for managing large amount of data up to the Exabyte level.
In this session I will talk about a new feature introduced in oVirt 3.6 which provides the ability to integrate with Red Hat Ceph storage using Cinder, a storage service used mainly for OpenStack.
This integration reveals new opportunities and tools for storage management in a scalable and virtualized way and also opens the door for interesting future integrations with other storage providers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this session I will describe how oVirt, an open source virtualization management platform, has extended and elevated its storage virtualization management capabilities by integrating with Cinder, a storage service, to manage resources from the Ceph Storage.
oVirt 3.6 revolutionize the way it manages virtualized storage to be much more scalable and flexible, and opens the door for future integrations with well known storage providers such as NetApp, EMC, HP and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We were asked to come up with a solution to setting up a cluster where
storage, management and VMs are running together on small number of
nodes. This solution is currently known as hyper converged
architecture. This kind of setup seems to be getting quite common in
small deployments, but it was not possible to use it and maintain all
oVirt reliability features until now. This presentation will be about
the system design and issues we encountered while installing the
minimal possible reliable cluster using three hyper converged hosts
with oVirt as the software stack and Gluster for the storage - all
running together in highly available setup across all three nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying the failure points of virtual datacenter with separate management, host and storage nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly available storage theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly available management theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying the high-availability in the context of an oVirt cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation and management of hyper-converged setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible issues and things to solve&lt;/li&gt;

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kuryr is a new project out of OpenStack Neutron's big stadium that makes Neutron networking available to Docker containers by means of a libnetwork remote driver. This allows to plug your Docker container based infrastructure on the same networking infrastructure as your virtual machines, simplifying management and bringing a lot of the production grade networking features that are part of what makes VM infrastructure the leading solution nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenStack Kuryr is the Neutron community answer to providing its advanced networking to the container world. This means that using Kuryr you will be able to use most of the production grade features of Neutron software defined networking such as routing, security groups, multi-tenancy, IPAM, dhcp, fwaas, floating IPs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuryr will allow you to share the networks with VMs bringing all your infra under a single administration that is constantly gaining features and improving across the board with things like VPNaaS, role based access control, external routers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you operate an OpenStack cloud, container infrastructure or a mix of two, this is a session that you should not miss, as we will be doing a live demo that previews the integration between the two worlds that will see its release in the Mitaka cycle (April 2016).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Evaluating OpenStack Containers as a service Magnum for production</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of new OpenStack services being developed and the hottest ones is the containers as a service Magnum. The project is so new that it's not even in the Project Navigator http://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator but it has been at the center stage at the past two OpenStack Summits. In this talk we'll answer to questions like: What is Magnum, what services does it offer, why is it important and why is a large operator looking into deploying it in production?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Application developers are increasingly looking at containers as a better way to manage the whole application lifecycle, from deployment to constant maintenance. Projects like Docker, CoreOS, the Open Container Initiative all aim at making life of application developers easier. OpenStack Magnum project offers container orchestration engines for deploying and managing containers as first class resources in OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnum is meant to launch a minimalistic host OS such as Fedora Atomic, CoreOS, or Ubuntu Snappy. The OS includes enough tools to launch Docker, Kubernetes, and Flannel. Once the OS is launched, Magnum configures the OS clusters for multi-tenant users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public cloud operators like DreamHost the questions that need to be answered are essentially two: how ready is Magnum for prime time and how hard is it going to be to keep it running at scale? In this talk I'll summarize the findings of my feasibility research regarding OpenStack Magnum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays companies/organizations migrate and operate their infrastructure in virtual infrastructures (Cloud/IaaS). To efficiently operate and adapt to everyday changes and requirements they need to leverage automation which will do not only configuration, but orchestration, backup/recovery, reporting and monitoring as well. All of the processes are related to organization and are used by people in the organization.
Imagine a tool which is able to automate and simplify whole process around the IaaS.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From spinning whole project’s infrastructure, set it up, help to operate, assign accounts, permissions and deprovisions when project ends. In this presentation we will try to show proposal for such solution. Using OpenStack for private cloud infrastrucure, Chef and midPoint as their orchestrator. And we will try to cover a little bit more. Think about user management and connection between users/employees and the infrastructure....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the oVirt project, getting a full testing environment where to run functional and integration tests for all the involved subprojects is a hard task, if you add to that that it has to be reproducible across machines, easy to automate and being able to be run on a developer laptop, you end up with a huge challenge, but we are up to it!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the oVirt project we are actively developing a framework that meets all those requirements, &lt;strong&gt;Lago&lt;/strong&gt;! (spanish/italian for lake)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to get a Vagrant environment running as quickly as possible, so that you can start iterating on your project right away.
I'll show you an upstream project called Oh-My-Vagrant that does the work and adds all the tweaks to glue different Vagrant provisioners together perfectly.
I'll also demonstrate some tools such as vscreen and vcssh which make it possible to connect to single and multiple numbers of vagrant vm's more easily.
We'll do all of this using the libvirt plugin to vagrant, which makes it possible to use the virsh and virt-manager tools in parallel with your vagrant toolset.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After this session, you'll walk away wondering how you ever did any work without these tools!
I'll explain and demonstrate many examples on how this makes integration with configuration management tools easier, and how you can use these techniques to simulate clusters of machines running containers!
This talk will include live demos of building docker containers, adding in config mgmt, and all glued together with vagrant and oh-my-vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yocto project has been used at Open-RnD for building a number of IoT
related products. The talk will go though the details of integration
of Poky build system and OpenEmbedded layers into 3 projects carried
out at Open-RnD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an antonomous parking space monitoring system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a distributed 3D steroscopic image acquisition system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a gadget for acquisition of metabolic parameters of professional
athletes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The presentation will approach to building software, automation and upstreaming of fixes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Open-RnD is a small software company from Łódź, Poland. We have
started using Yocto/Poky in late 2013 as a better alternative to
in-house build system. Since then, we have successfully implemented a
number of projects based on Poky. The presentation will go through the
details of 3 projects that cover a diverse range of applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an autonomous parking space monitoring system (ParkEasily)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a distributed 3D stereoscopic image acquisition system (Ros3D)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a gadget for acquisition of metabolic parameters of professional
athletes (Sonda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We only use widely available hardware platforms such as BeagleBone
Black, Raspberry Pi, Wandboard or Gateworks GW5400 (not as widely used
as the previous ones, but still fully supported), hence all the points
made during presentation are directly applicable by professionals and
hobbyists alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Open-RnD&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-RnD is a small company. The embedded team if even smaller,
currently consisting of only 4 people. Since we have rather little
resources for maintaining of software, as much work as possible is
pushed upstream to Yocto, OE, libraries and packages we depend on
(swupdate, Vala, rabbitmq-c, sparts, edts) or tools (ex. jhbuild).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Poky/OE methodology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will cover out methodology of staying close to the
upstream. Normally when starting a new project we will base it on Poky
&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; instead of relying on, so called, stable releases (the same
approach is used for other layers). This has a number of advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you get the latest versions of libraries (with fixes &amp;amp; bugs alike)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's easy to upstream fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our practice is to maintain a mirror of upstream repositories. The
mirrors are synced every couple of days by our staff members. The
branches are then periodically merged into project related
branches. Systematic merges help to reduce the number of commits that
we need to look at, so the whole effort of merging &amp;amp; reviewing is
rather limited. Effectively very few software packages are used by the
projects, so most of the commits have no or little effect on the
stability of the software stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jenkins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll also cover a very simple Jenkins integration wrapper that can be
utilized for building Poky based projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Development methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll give some tips on how we think is convenient to develop software
so that the integration with any build system is smooth. Specifically
we'll emphasize the role of tools such as jhbuild in the whole process
and provide tips on how to utilize them efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ParkEasily&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project's goal is to build a system for autonomous parking space
monitoring. This is used for feeding a mobile client application with
information on parking space availability within a given area and
allows us to direct users to the closest available car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is composed of a server backend written in Erlang (hoping
to be able to present a couple of issues at Lambda Days in Krakow), an
intemediate AMQP broker (RabbitMQ) and device endpoints that integrate
with parking gates or tap into industrial video streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will cover our first prototyping steps on Raspberry
Pi and a later implementation on BeagleBone Black. We'll highlight the
aspects of layer organization, and how our methodology of working with
Yocto upstream applies in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also go through number of fixes related to building of
bootable SD card images were implemented for the &lt;code&gt;wic&lt;/code&gt; tool. The
upstreamed fixes allowed for building a bootable SD images for
BeagleBone Black out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will focus on layer organization, and give tips on
maintenance of custom application layers. We'll also introduce our
&lt;code&gt;open-rnd&lt;/code&gt; branded distribution within &lt;code&gt;meta-openrnd&lt;/code&gt; layer and
justify why we have done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the project covered some aspects of 3G/4G and VPN connectivity,
we'll cover that providing examples how to tie that nicely with
systemd and udev at Poky level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sonda&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Yocto to implement a mobile base hub and recharging station
for IoT gadgets. The base hub was responsible for downloading of any
unsent data from the devices. We'll give details on implementing a
service that needs to react to external devices appearing on a USB
bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we did a low level integration with a MQTT broker. This part
will also cover why it is important to have a working build system for
software packages before starting with Poky and problems we identified
with libmqttv3c library from Eclipse's Paho Project. Due to limited
compatibility with Glib's main loop approach of the libmqttv3c
library, we have decided to implement a separate library based on
embedded version of the original MQTT library. The library requires
cleaning up and will be pushed to our github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ros3D&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is aimed at building a system for acquisition of
stereoscopic video for professional filmmakers. The project is
partially funded by a grant from the National Centre for Research and
Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is the most demanding compared to other two. The talk will
focus on do's and don'ts of layer organization and custom distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically we have implemented a layering scheme that nicely
separates the base layers, the BSP layers and the application
layers. This allows for plugging in a different platform at the BSP
level to keep the development cycle going even when the target
hardware is not available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tizen is an open source Linux based software platform for mobile, wearable and other embedded devices. In this talk you will learn how to build and port Tizen 3 to connected DIY (do it yourself) devices using industry standard tools provided by the Yocto Project and Openembedded. The presentation will also include practicals examples that demonstrate the flexibility of Yocto/OE to extend the Tizen distribution with your applications and new IoT (Internet of Things) features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tizen is an open source GNU/Linux based software platform for mobile, wearable and embedded devices as well as Internet of Things. Tizen:Common provides a generic development environment for Tizen 3 which key features include, Wayland, Weston, EFL UI/UX toolkit, and a web runtime for safely running standalone HTML5 apps.Yocto Project offers tools to easily expends features of Tizen:Common by creating layers for new profiles.
This talk will focus the Tizen architecture and it will provide guidelines for creating and building new Tizen profiles, based on Tizen:Common, using the Yocto Project for devices with Intel or ARM processors. It will also provide information about hidden gems in Tizen on Yocto and practical examples for packaging and deploying HTML5 applications through Yocto recipes for the open source hardware development boards like Raspberry Pi 2 or HummingBoard (Freescale I.MX6 ARM SoC) or MinnowBoard Max (Intel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, since Tizen aims to become the OS of everything, we will illustrate this by extending Tizen Distro with new connectivity features provided by IoTivity library, the open source implementation of OpenInterConnect’s standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No previous experience with Tizen or the Yocto project is required. Attendees can expect to learn how to use Tizen on Yocto for building boot loader, Linux kernel and the Tizen software platform for various hardware architectures. Advanced techniques and practical examples for extending Tizen and adding new features will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice : This presentation will focus on TizenYocto while OIC’s IoTivity will be just mentioned as an example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Secure architecture for HTML5 applications, from development to production</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone understands why a car should be more secure than a phone. Embedded applications typically request special privileges such as playing sound, sending SMS or geolocating. Those running on vehicles, while having the same requirements, need to be more strictly constrained to prevent dramatic consequences on equipment, driver and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common motivation to ignore security is cost reduction and time-to-market. Developing secure HTML5 applications should be smooth and simple. This talk presents a model of architecture leveraging modern tools such as Gulp, Angular and Foundation6 to simplify the production of applications for the automotive industry, while respecting strong security constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses on the GNU/Linux AGL distribution and responds to the following concerns :
- How to guarantee that malicious HTML5 applications cannot impair security ("Never trust HTML5 code") ?
- How to enforce privilege isolation through SMACK ?
- How to enforce code isolation via dynamic plugin loading/unloading ?
- How to debug code on both the target and development station ?
- How to support mixed HTML5/native applications without impairing security ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also take a look at the AGL HTML5 stack, its development and integration pace in AGL distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The kernelci.org project is currently doing hundreds of build and boot tests for upstream kernels on a wide variety of hardware. This session will provide an introduction to the kernelci.org system, some live demos and how to start consuming its results, and be a forum for further discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed boards farms across the world are working together to deliver unified build, boot, and test results for every merge of an upstream Linux kernel tree. A community based architecture agnostic effort, kernelci.org aims to detect regressions in a timely manner and report back to kernel developers with a concise summary of the issues found. On every merge, all defconfigs for x86, arm, and arm64 are built, booted, and tested on over 300 real or virtual hardware platforms. Come join in the discussion and help make Linux better!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>GNU/Linux for Safety Related Systems</title>
        <subtitle>Architectural and Procedural Issues</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, Mobile and Automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk outlines the architectural approach proposed for utilizing GNU/Linux
in safety related systems up to a mid-level integrity (IEC 61508 Ed 2 SIL2,
ISO 26262 ASIL B, DO 178C Level D/C) and how the qualification process could
look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore the current status of OSADLs SIL2LinuxMP project is reported on.
The SIL2LinuxMP Project was started in April 2015 and strives for qualification
by mid 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, safety-critical systems isolate the safety-related functions
ideally into a simple node, exclusively covering a minimal and simple
functionality. Such safe computing nodes traditionally run on "simple"
single-core processors and use a minimum software stack. Contemporary
single core CPUs are no longer simple and the growing complexity of
systems, e.g. including network security requirements, complex control
algorithms and even cognitive functions for autonomy raise the complexity
beyond what small and simple single core CPUs can handle. This traditional
approach to functional safety is changing as nicely expressed by NASA
procedural requirements for safety related software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "This Standard does not discourage the use of software in safety-critical
  systems. When designed and implemented correctly, software is often the
  first, and sometimes the best, hazard detection and prevention mechanism
  in the system." [NASA NPR 8719.13B 1.2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The changes noted above coincide with significant developments of the past
decade impacting the design of safety-related systems
 · growing system complexity and safety demands
 · broad introduction of multi-core CPUs
 · significant change in the development dynamics
 · dramatically increasing algorithmic complexity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Staying at "simple" single-core computers would come at the price of
de-coupling from the main-stream chip and computer-science development
and that, in the long run, would induce more risks than it will mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In this talk we outline the architectural approach we propose for utilizing GNU/Linux
for safety related systems up to a mid-level integrity (IEC 61508 Ed 2 SIL2, ISO 26262
ASILB, DO 178C Level D/C) and what the qualification process of a GNU/Linux RTOS based
system, as an example of a OSS based safety related system, could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We also report on the current status of OSADLs SIL2LinuxMP project that was started in
April 2015 and strives for qualification by mid 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We will talk about some of the tricks we use to fit V7, the smallest JavaScript VM, into a few Kb: succinct and implicit data structures, compacting GC in O(1) space.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual machines, especially those as complex as JavaScript, are often associated with big overheads. We will show how we traded time for space in order to reduce the runtime overhead and make even the smallest microcontrollers parse and run JavaScript, with all his quirks! We will talk about how to compact a heap and relocate all the pointers without using any extra temporary space, how to encode trees without pointers and how to traverse graphs without using a stack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The 25 minutes talk intends to familiarize the audience with the Processing software sketchbook &amp;amp; language used extensively in education, and gives an overview of the state of this software running on single board computers (RPi, Allwinner SOCs). The second part outlines the challenges in implementing a vendor-neutral hardware I/O library, and what parts are currently missing (esp. kernel-wise) to offer an "Arduino"-like functionality across many affordable SBCs running Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Processing (https://processing.org/) is a JAVA-based programming environment and educational framework for learning how to code. Initiated by Ben Fry &amp;amp; Casey Reas in 2001, Processing is being widely used in contexts such as design and visual arts education. Processing is FOSS and being developed by a wide group of users &amp;amp; educators at https://github.com/processing/processing/.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Unitary Patent is the third major attempt to legalize software patents in Europe. The European Patent Court will become the Eastern District of Texas when it comes to software patent disputes in Europe. As happened in America, the concentration of power will force up legal costs, punish small European innovators, and benefit large patent holders.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Unitary Patent is the third major attempt to legalize software patents in Europe. The European Patent Court will become the Eastern District of Texas when it comes to software patent disputes in Europe. As happened in America, the concentration of power will force up legal costs, punish small European innovators, and benefit large patent holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second attempt to codify EPO software patents failed in 2005, after many years of debate, the directive was rejected under the request of large multinational corporations, that prefered the creation of a central patent court over the debate on software patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unitary Patent Court is a deeply flawed project, as it is based on dubious economic studies, a rogue patent office (the EPO), a court stuffed with biased patent specialists, and is out of parliamentary control. It will participate to global patent warming, rubberstamp software patents, multiply the number of patent trolls, and increase the entry cost for defendants, which is already out of reach for many of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade Teluu have dual-licensed pjsip to over 300 licensees. Indemnity, legal negotiations, violations are some of the things we have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proprietary license itself have evolved over the years, and also the way we approach licensing negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However even with all that questions still remains on dual licensing, for example software patents doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most embedded computing products run Linux. However, obtaining the complete, corresponding source code (CCS), which Linux's license (GPL) requires, can prove difficult. The license dictates technical requirements;verification of a source code release for license compliance therefore requires technical analysis.  After 15 years of reviewing such CCS relases, the speaker discovered (finally!) an excellent example,which not only meets GPL's requirements, but also encourages users to take advantage of their rights to modify and install new versions of the software. This talk explains the aspects of the source release that made it particularly outstanding, and proposes methods to achieve similar compliance successes. Attendees will learn procedures to increase the "tinkerer" userbase,and receive valuable insight into the compliance engineering analysis that occurs during GPL enforcement work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nonprofit organizations, commonly (though inaccurately) called "foundations" in the free software and open source world,  now play an important role in the project landscape, especially for projects having high commercial significance. This talk will critically examine purported benefits of open source foundations and will discuss their drawbacks. Possibilities for reform of open source foundations, and alternatives to foundations, will be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nonprofit organizations, commonly (though inaccurately) called "foundations" in the free software and open source world, now play an important role in the governance of many well-known projects. Larger, popular and commercially-significant projects are likely to be criticized if they don't create a foundation or affiliate with an existing one, especially if the project appears to be controlled by narrow corporate interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foundations are generally assumed to be a good solution for project governance, at least if "foundation proliferation" is avoided. In the past few years a number of advocates of foundations have spoken about various political, legal, social and fiscal benefits that are said to be associated with such forms of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a skeptical and critical examination of the supposed benefits of open source foundations. The talk will also discuss various drawbacks to foundations that have not commonly been acknowledged. The two main types of foundations (charities and trade associations) will be contrasted. Possibilities for reform of foundations to address some of their problems, and alternatives to foundation governance, will be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The license compliance industry purportedly helps information technology companies and other actors to use publicly available software, and in particular free software, in a way that is compliant with the relevant free software licenses.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will review why the license compliance industry exists and discuss, from an external point of view, how it operates. We will then highlight some potential ethical issues on the current best practices for license compliance in the industry, and propose community-oriented alternatives that we can build, today, on top of the existing corpus of publicly available free software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Why a Patent License is Necessarily Implied But a Trademark License Is Not</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted that, even where a FOSS license is silent on patents, there is an implied patent license granted. The theory under US law is equitable estoppel, legal estoppel, or both. A license implied by equitable estoppel is one based on conduct, and a license implied by legal estoppel is based on the principle that one may not license a right, in the case of FOSS licenses the copyright, and then derogate from the right granted by asserting a different right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session will briefly cover the concepts of equitable estoppel and legal estoppel and argue that, while both trademarks and patents may be impliedly licensed by equitable estoppel, and patents are always licensed under a theory of legal estoppel, trademarks (qua trademark, not the pure letter string) will never be impliedly licensed under the doctrine of legal estoppel because enforcing trademark rights does not derogate from the copyright grant, i.e., the right to run, study, adapt, redistribute and improve the program.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What is the "safety-critical" domain?
What challenges does it present to Free Software with regard to process?
Can FOSS become "safety-critical"?
What are the implications of using copyleft licenses in safety-critical software?
What is the roadmap?
What resources to engage in the discussion is available?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will try and have a short presentation on what safety-critical software is, where its used, and why its important that software freedom is part of the domain. I will discuss some concrete results towards a GNU/Linux software stack that may be a candidate for certification for safety-critical use. Lastly, I'd like very much to engage the audience on the subject matter, particularly on the dynamic of copyleft and how it may provide a greater level of transparency than proprietary software not just into the actual code but in the entire process and supply chain and hardware. Copyleft may be an effective mechanism to ensure a necessary level of transparency as well as adequate protection for source cod e that is expensive to produce and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The GPL restricts freedom to redistribute, for some developers, to preserve and expand freedom for all users, including developers. This is a tradeoff we free software aficionados accept. What other tradeoffs around freedom are we accepting, when it comes to user experience (including developer experience), codes of conduct, and our financial structures? When we compare those policies and assumptions to licenses like the GPL, we learn unexpected lessons about our attitudes towards governance, and we consider where our decisions place us on the liberty-to-hospitality spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we compare community anti-harassment policies to licenses like the GPL, we learn unexpected lessons about our attitudes towards governance. In this talk, I discuss the similarities and differences between codes of conduct and a set of agreements that our communities are more used to: “copyleft” or other restrictive software licenses. I also draw out some ways that the kinds of acts and artifacts that these policies cover reveal different attitudes towards contracts and governance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to Contributor Licence Agreements, the DCO has proven to be very popular and, when coupled to a strong source control system like git, solves all of the issues of tracking and provenance that plague legacy CLA systems.  This talk will examine the basis and mechanisms for the DCO, using the Linux kernel (the earliest DCO adopter) as an example and finally explore issues which have arisen in using the DCO for strong patent licences like Apache-2 and GPLv3&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the DCO is free from the kernel (http://developercertificate.org/) it can be used in any project. This talk begins with why you need a Contributor Agreement (CA) in the first place, explores some of the history and reasons for the various CAs and why Linux was forced to adopt the DCO nearly ten years ago. We will contrast the ten years of DCO experience against some other projects which use more specific CAs and explain the benefits and pitfalls. We will also give advice on best practices around using the DCO, what else is required to make the DCO work correctly and what problems still remain.   The final hurdle in using the DCO for every licence seems to be the question of patents and strong patent licences (Apache-2 and GPLv3).  We will examine the current status of the DCO as it pertains to patents and investigate new mechanisms to strengthen the agency aspect of corporate DCO contributions&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>An in-depth look at efforts to make choosing a license easy</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Are interactive tools like choosealicense.com or the Creative Commons license chooser effective? What about noninteractive guides like the Free Software Foundation's situational license recommendations? Do these tools have agendas, and if so, are these agendas made explicit and are they in line with the interests of the developers who use them? Can we find ways to make them better, or do we need a brand new tool?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There's of course many free software and free culture licenses out
there, and some commonly used standard nonfree ones as well. The
problem of "license proliferation" has been and continues to be
identified as a problem in our world. Especially when starting a new
project, choosing which one of the licenses to use can be daunting and
conflict-prone, and these choices are not what developers typically
want to spend their time on. As one solution to this problem (or
coping mechanism), some companies and nonprofits have developed tools
and guides aiming to narrow the set of options based on plain language
statements about what the developer would like her project's license
to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the most popular interactive tools are Github's
choosealicense.com and Creative Commons' license chooser. Then there
are the noninteractive guides, like the Free Software Foundation's
best practice license recommendations, a subset drawn from its full
list of free licenses. Some of these tools claim to be "objective",
while others are explicit about their connection with specific
missions or agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll do a survey of these tools and guides, along with a bit about
their history, then assess their usefulness for developers and
possible impacts on things like license usage counting surveys. I'll
highlight the ways in which the most prominent ones either
intentionally or possibly unintentionally further a particular agenda.
That will involve a look at the language choices we make when trying
to describe license terms in "plain language," such as whether we call
a provision a "restriction" or a "protection," and the implications of
those choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll invite discussion along the way, and maybe together we'll come
away with some productive next steps to improve license culture and
education for everyone, such as pull requests for existing tools, or
an outline for a new, ideal tool for someone (the FSF?) to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
